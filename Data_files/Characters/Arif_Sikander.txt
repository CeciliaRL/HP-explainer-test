'''Professor Arif Sikander''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who acted as the replacement [[Muggle Studies]] teacher at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990–1991 school year]], whilst the former teacher [[Quirinus Quirrell]] was away on a sabbatical trip in [[Europe]].<ref name="HM71">{{HM|7|1}}</ref><ref name="HM73">{{HM|7|3}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Muggle Studies]]''': As a professor of Muggle Studies at Hogwarts, Sikander was highly knowledgeable of [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and their ways of living.<ref name="HM73"/><ref name="HM74">{{HM|7|4|ms}}</ref>

==Etymology==
'''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arif_(given_name) Arif]''' is a male Arabic name meaning "knowledgeable" or "wise". '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikandar Sikandar]''' is the Persian version of the name Alexander, meaning "to defend man".

==Behind the scenes==
*This character appears to have been modeled after an [[Unidentified Hogwarts employees#Attendant with a moustache and goatee|unnamed background character]] that made an appearance in the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|first film]], suggesting that the two are supposed to be the same person. 
*Assuming Professor Sikander was offered the post full-time once it became clear that Quirrell would switch subjects rather than return to it, this would also imply that Sikander was the [[Unidentified male Muggle Studies professor|male Muggle Studies professor]] mentioned in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|video game adaption]] of {{COS}}.
