'''Philbert Chivers''' was an eccentric [[Wizardkind|wizard]] from [[London]] who believed that [[Nargle]]s were stealing from the shops on [[Diagon Alley]] and hiding in [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] sewers.<ref name="FBC">{{FBC|6|1}}</ref>

==Biography==

In a beast-related incident investigated by [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and her [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|partner]] from the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]'s [[Beast Division]], Chivers was reported to be missing. He was later found unconscious in the London sewers having been knocked out by falling bricks. He was then transported to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] and treated by [[Healer]] [[Omar Abasi]].<ref name="FBC"/>

Chivers believed that the [[British Ministry of Magic]] was involved with covering up the existence of Nargles. He went to [[Slug & Jiggers Apothecary]] hoping to purchase "[[Poison|Narglecide]]", so [[Humphrey Balsamo]] relabelled some dud [[potion]]s, and gave them to him free. These potions included an unstable [[Swelling Solution]] which was consumed by the [[beast]] dwelling in the sewers.<ref name="FBC"/>
