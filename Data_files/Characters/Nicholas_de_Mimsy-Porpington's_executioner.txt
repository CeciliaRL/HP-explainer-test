{{Quote|Nick, if you please, will you get to your knees. This may sting a bit.|The executioner|J. K. Rowling's official site}}
This '''individual''' (fl. [[1492]]) was the man in charge of [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]]'s execution in [[1492]], after the [[wizardkind|wizard]] made a tusk sprout out of a [[Lady Grieve|noble lady]]. The man appeared to be familiar with the [[Wizardkind|wizard]], as he called him "Nick". The execution went wrong, however, as someone misplaced the rock where they usually sharpened the axe. The executioner took forty-five hacks until he killed Sir Nicholas, and in between whacks and thwacks, he reassured Sir Nicholas that it "''won't be too long''".<ref name="background">[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=11 Extra Stuff - "Nearly Headless Nick"] on [[J.
