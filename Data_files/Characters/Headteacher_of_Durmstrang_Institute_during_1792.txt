{{Quote|Well, the Heads of the participating schools are always on the panel, because all three of them were injured during the Tournament of 1792, when a cockatrice the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage.

This '''individual''' (fl. [[1792]]) was a [[Headmaster|Headteacher]] of [[Durmstrang Institute]] during the [[1790s]].<ref name="GF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref> 

==Biography==
In 1792, the [[Triwizard Tournament]] was held at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts Castle]], and this Headteacher and the Durmstrang student delegation travelled to [[Scotland]], along with the [[Headteacher of Beauxbatons Academy of Magic during 1792|Head of Beauxbatons]], and were welcomed by the [[Headteacher of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during 1792|Head of Hogwarts]]. One of the tasks involved catching a [[Cockatrice]], which went on a rampage and injured the judges, including the Durmstrang Head. This incident, along with the rising number of deaths, was a contributing factor to the eventual disbandment of the Tournament, though there were a few unsuccessful attempts to revive it.<ref name="GF15" />
