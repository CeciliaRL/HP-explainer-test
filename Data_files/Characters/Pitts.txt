He was previously owned by a [[Wizardkind|wizard or witch]], who treated him cruelly and gave him to the [[Hogwarts kitchens]] for next to nothing.<ref name="HM518">{{HM|5|18}}</ref> According to [[Rita Skeeter]], [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]] spoke to him shortly before his expulsion.<ref name="HM4RR">{{HM|4|Rita Returns}}, if the player chooses to learn a secret and let Rita write a story about [[Torvus]]</ref> He was strict when it came to making sure other house-elves and students in [[Discipline at Hogwarts|detention]] did their work properly in the kitchens.

He also noted that [[Barnaby Lee]] had "an appetite like a [[Mountain troll|Mountain Troll]]" and Hogwarts kitchens had to increase their sandwich production.
