'''Alasdair Maddock''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and former [[Chaser]] for the [[Montrose Magpies]]<ref name=":0">[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[31 July]], [[1998]], Page 2</ref> who had what some people believed to have been a rather unsettling obsession with [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] sports. He once tried to play football "for a laugh" and tried to incorporate it into [[Quidditch]]. Once, he tried to dribble the [[Quaffle]] like a [[basketball]],<ref name=":0" /> and on another occasion, tried to hit the [[Quaffle]] with his head like a [[football]] player. He was later fired by the manager, [[Cormack McLeod]], for playing [[golf]] in the summer of [[1999]].<ref>[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[1 June]], [[1999]], Page 4</ref>
