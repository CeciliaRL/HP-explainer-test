'''Chris Lunney''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] photographer who worked for the ''[[Daily Express]]''. Two of his photos were featured on the front page of an issue of the paper in the summer of [[1995]]: the first was of heat-exhausted spectators at a [[Royal Air Force]] show being tended by a nurse, in an article about an unprecedented heat wave that was then affecting [[Great Britain]] titled "Killer Heat," and the second was of a soap star with her hand raised to shield her face from the camera.<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:DailyExpress.png|this image]])</ref>
