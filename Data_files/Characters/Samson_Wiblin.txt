'''Samson Wiblin''' (fl. [[1430]]) was an [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who lived in [[England]] during the [[15th century]].

==Biography==
He was the favourite to win the [[All-England Wizarding Duelling Competition]] of [[1430]], but was beaten by [[Alberta Toothill]], who hit him with a [[Blasting Curse]]. It can be assumed that Samson was an excellent duellist as Ms Toothill was immortalised on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]] just for beating him.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="PM">{{PM}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Samson" comes from the Hebrew name שִׁמְשׁוֹן (Shimshon) which probably meant "sun".
