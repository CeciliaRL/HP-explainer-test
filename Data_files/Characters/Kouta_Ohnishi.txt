{{Quote|I'll be able to go back to [[Potions (class)|Potion Class]] now. Thanks, [[Harry Potter|Harry]].|Morcott in the [[Stone Bridge]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)}}'''Kouta Ohnishi''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Hufflepuff]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref><ref name="HBPG"/>

==Biography==
During the [[1996–1997 school year]], he had to brew a [[Draught of Peace]] for [[Potions (class)|Potions]], but could not do so because he lacked the [[horned slug]]s that were one of the ingredients required to make the [[potion]]. He traded [[syrup of Hellebore]] with [[Harry Potter]] in order to get the horned slugs he needed. He was also a member of the [[Duelling Club]].<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Kouta" is from Japanese 康 (kou) "peace" and 太 (ta) "thick, big".

==Behind the scenes==
*It is most likely that Kouta was in his [[fifth year]] in the [[1996–1997 school year]], as the Draught of Peace is usually brewed in that year.
*Given his name, he is most likely of Japanese descent.
