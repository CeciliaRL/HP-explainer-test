The second pet '''[[snake]]''' of [[Morfin Gaunt]] was the replacement of [[Morfin Gaunt's first snake|another late snake]]. The snake was an [[Adder]].<ref name="HBP10">{{HBP|B|10}}</ref>

==History==
When [[Bob Ogden]] came to visit the [[Gaunt Shack]], Morfin was twisting it in his fingers, singing to it in [[Parseltongue]]:<br />

"''Hissy, hissy, little snakey''<br />
''slither on the floor,''<br />
''you be good to Morfin,''<br />
''or he'll nail you to the door.''"<ref name="HBP10"/>

The snake's final fate is unknown, but the day it heard the song was the same day Morfin was placed under arrest by the [[Magical Law Enforcement Patrol|Wizard police]], along with [[Marvolo Gaunt|his father]]. It was evident that the arrest was beneficial for the snake, as it was spared the gruesome, inhumane fate of being nailed.<ref name="HBP10"/>
