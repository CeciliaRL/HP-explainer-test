This '''[[Dark Wizard]]'''Â was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who fought during the [[Second Wizarding War]]. 

==Biography==
This wizard was presumably born in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]] some time during the [[20th century]]. At some point in his adult life, he became well-versed in the [[Dark Arts]] and joined the [[Death Eaters]], becoming a loyal servant of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. He presumably fought during the [[First Wizarding War]] with his fellow Death Eaters for Voldemort's [[Pure-blood supremacy|cause]]. 

On [[2 May]] [[1998]], This Death Eater was called by his master to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], which he responded to and fought with his fellow Death Eaters against the [[Hogwartian|defenders]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. During the battle, he was killed by a student or member of staff on the [[Hogwarts Castle#Seventh Floor|Seventh Floor]].<ref>{{DH|B|31}}</ref><ref>{{DH|F2}}</ref>
