{{Quote|The school nurse had seen what Aunt Petunia's eyes - so sharp when it came to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in observing the comings and goings of the neighbours - simply refused to see: that, far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and weight of a young killer whale.|On the subject of a letter sent from the nurse to the Dursley family.|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
This '''female''' (c. [[1994]]) was a woman employed by the [[Smeltings Academy]] of [[Great Britain]] sometime in or, possibly, before [[1994]].<ref name="GOF3">{{GOF|B|3}}</ref>

==Biography==
Sometime in or before [[1976]]<ref name="AGE"/> this woman was born to a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] family. She eventually was hired by the [[Smeltings Academy]] of [[Great Britain]], and worked for the school as a nurse.

In [[1994|1994,]] she sent a letter to the [[Dursley family]] about [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]'s considerable weight. The letter informed them that the school no longer had [[British terms#K|knickerbockers]] large enough to fit him, and included a diet sheet comprised mostly of fruits and vegetables.<ref name="GOF3" />

==Personality and traits==
Little is known of this woman's personality; however, it seemed that she was a fairly caring person as she not only was hired by a school, but was troubled enough by the weight of [[Dudley Dursley]] that she sent a letter and a diet sheet to the [[4 Privet Drive|Dursley home]] to try and get the family to help Dudley lose weight.<ref name="GOF3"/>
