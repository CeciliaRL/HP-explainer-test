==Etymology==
Derived from the Old English elements ''ead'' "rich, blessed" and ''gar'' "spear". This was the name of a [[First millennium A.D.|10th century]] English king who is regarded as a saint. The name did not survive long after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 18th century, in part due to a character by this name in Sir Walter Scott's novel 'The Bride of Lammermoor' (1819). Famous bearers include author and poet Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849), French impressionist painter Edgar Degas (1834-1917), and author Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950).
