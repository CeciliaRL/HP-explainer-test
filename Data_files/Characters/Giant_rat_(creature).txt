The '''giant rat''' was a [[rat]] that lived in the cellar of the [[Leaky Cauldron]]. Once a normal rat, during the summer of [[1993]], it consumed a large quantity of [[rat tonic]] from [[Tom]]'s stores. This over-consumption caused it to grow to an immense size.<ref>{{POA|G}} - Game Boy Advance version</ref>
