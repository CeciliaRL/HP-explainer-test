This '''individual''' (fl. [[1995]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who worked for [[Magical Maintenance Department|Magical Maintenance]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in the capacity of [[Ministry of Magic lifts|lift]] attendant in the mid-[[1990s]].

==Biography==
He was noticeably bored during the course of his job on the morning of [[12 August]], on which day he was operating the lift that carried [[Harry Potter]] and [[Arthur Weasley]] down into Level 9 and [[Courtroom Ten]].<ref name="OPf5">{{OOTP|F}} - Chapter 5 (''The Ministry of Magic'')</ref>

By [[1997]], during [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|puppet regime]], there were no attendants operating the lifts, so it is possible this individual either quit his job or was sacked for his blood status.
