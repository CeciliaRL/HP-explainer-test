The '''Goshawk sisters''' were the nine sisters of the [[Goshawk family]]. They included the renowned author [[Miranda Goshawk]] as well as [[Diadema Goshawk]], [[Romilda Goshawk]], [[Tangwystl Goshawk]] and five other sisters of unknown name.

Miranda was the youngest of the nine and in their youth, the sisters would often play pranks on Miranda by giving her incorrect [[incantation]]s for [[spell]]s. Miranda, as the youngest, also often ended up wearing her sisters' hand-me-down [[robes]].

Miranda was eventually able to turn the tables on her sisters when she wrote ''[[Book of Spells]]'' and her sisters "somehow" ended up with copies featuring misprints.<ref name="wonderbook">{{WBS}}</ref>
