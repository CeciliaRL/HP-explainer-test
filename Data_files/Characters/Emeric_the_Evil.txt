'''Emeric the Evil'''<ref name="PS8"/> was a short-lived but exceptionally aggressive [[Dark Wizard]] from the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="TBB"/>

==Biography==
During his lifetime, he was once the master of the [[Elder Wand]]. With it, he terrorised the south of [[England]] in the early [[Middle Ages]]. He was "''slaughtered''" in a ferocious [[Duel Between Emeric the Evil and Egbert the Egregious|duel]] against [[Egbert the Egregious]].<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|E}} - ''Albus Dumbledore on "''The Tale of the Three Brothers''"''</ref>

During their [[History of Magic]] lessons with [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], [[first year]] students often mixed up Emeric the Evil with [[Uric the Oddball]].<ref name="PS8">{{PS|B|8}}</ref> The [[seventh year]] History of Magic curriculum also covered Emeric the Evil, at least in the [[1990–1991 school year]].<ref name="HM72hm">{{HM|7|2|hm}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Emeric the Evil was a profilic [[Dark Wizard]] who would have been accomplished with dark magic, likely including the casting of [[dark charm]]s. It is said that he terrorised Southern [[England]] in the early Middle Ages, which he likely did using the Dark Arts.<ref name="TBB"/>
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Having gained ownership of the legendary [[Elder Wand]], Emeric was an aggressive wizard with a proclivity for duelling and [[martial magic]]; however, he was defeated and killed in a duel with [[Egbert the Egregious]], meaning he was an inferior duellist to him.<ref name="TBB"/>
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Emeric was capable of flying a [[dragon]]-like creature, an extremely dangerous looking [[magic]]al [[beast]], showing he was to an extent skilled with taming and controlling it.<ref name="TBBIE">{{TBB|IE}}</ref><!--- Please do not define this unnamed beast as a "Wyvern"; these are not a defined species in HP (only one beast is called one), and the illustrated edition uses no such name.--->

==Etymology==
The name "Emeric" is a Germanic name, in which the second element is ''ric'' meaning "power". The first element may be ''ermen'' "whole, universal" (making it a relative of ''Ermenrich''), ''amal'' "work, labour" (making it a relative of ''Amalric'') or ''heim'' "home" (making it a relative of ''Henry''). It is likely that several forms merged into a single name.

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{TBB|IE}}, [[Chris Riddell]] depicts Emeric the Evil riding an unnamed [[dragon]]-like creature, which is unnamed in the text, it is only shown in the illustration of him. This is not stated in the original version of {{TBB}} either. The nature of this dragon is also unknown.
