'''Sanderson Bowles''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] and a member of the [[St. Troglodous Order of Labours]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}} {{see image|File:Sanderson Bowles and STOOL.jpeg}}</ref>

==Biography==
By at least the [[2010s]], Bowles became a member of the St. Troglodous Order of Labours. As part of this organisation, he proposed that blended [[Dragon dung Fertiliser]] increased the potency of [[Leaping Toadstool]]s. He shared this advice with a member of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]], who brought it back to the rest of the organisation and used it to great effect when using Leaping Toadstools to brew [[Baruffio's Brain Elixir]].<ref name="WU"/>
