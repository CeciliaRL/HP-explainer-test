The '''Thurkell brothers''' (fl. [[17th century]]) were the seven sons of [[Thaddeus Thurkell]]. They all turned out to be [[Squib]]s. This made their [[Wizardkind|wizard]] father so angry that he [[Human to hedgehog spell|transfigured]] them into [[hedgehog]]s out of disgust.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

It is rare for a single Squib to be born into a [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] family. The fact that all seven of the Thurkell brothers were non-magical seems to indicate that there was something out of the ordinary about their case.
