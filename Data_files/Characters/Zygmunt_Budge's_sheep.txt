This '''flock of sheep''' was kept by accomplished [[potioneer]] [[Zygmunt Budge]], in the island of [[Hermetray]], in the [[16th century|1500s]].<ref name="WBoP"/> 

==Biography==
These [[sheep]], along with the [[rat]]s that infested [[Zygmunt Budge's house|his house]], were the only company Budge had on the deserted island.<ref name="WBoP"/>

After developing his own version of the [[Shrinking Solution]], Budge accidentally spilt a small ammount on the grass outside his house. It proved so powerful that it caused the entire flock of sheep to shrink to lambs the size of woolly [[Mouse|mice]] (Budge went on to use the shrunken lambs as ear-warmers for the chilly winters at [[Hermetray]]).<ref name="WBoP">{{WBP}} - Chapter 4 (''[[Beautification Potion]]'')</ref>
