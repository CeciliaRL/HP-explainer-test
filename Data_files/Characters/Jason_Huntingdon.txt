==Biography==
In [[1996]], on the [[Hogwarts Express]], Jason stole a pair of [[Luna Lovegood]]'s [[Spectrespecs]], which he did not know how to use. [[Harry Potter]] retrieved them giving him a periodical in return. Once at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Jason was usually spending time at the [[Great Hall]] and at the [[Viaduct Entrance]]. Jason traded an [[Armadillo bile]] with Harry Potter.<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Jason" is from the Greek name Ιασων (Iason), which was derived from Greek ιασθαι (iasthai) "to heal". In Greek mythology Jason was the leader of the Argonauts. After his uncle Pelias overthrew his father as king of Iolcos, Jason went in search of the Golden Fleece in order to win back the throne. During his journeys he married the sorceress Medea, who helped him gain the fleece and kill his uncle, but who later turned against him when he fell in love with another woman.
