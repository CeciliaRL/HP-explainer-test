'''Myron Otherhaus''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who lived in the [[19th century]]. Described as "very handsome," he was resided in [[Bury St Edmunds]], [[Wikipedia:Suffolk|Suffolk]].<ref name="PM">{{WW|the-floo-network}}</ref>

==Biography==
One day in [[1855]], [[Violet Tillyman]] unexpectedly tumbled out of Myron's fireplace via the [[Floo Network]], having left her home after a nasty argument with her bullying husband, [[Albert Tillyman|Albert]]. In a distressed state, she had tried to say, "''I want to go to [[Violet Tillyman's mother|Mother's]] house''", but the words had not come out clearly between her sobs and hiccoughs. However, despite Violet's red, tear-streaked face and ash-covered clothing, she and Myron immediately fell in love with each other.<ref name="PM"/>

For the next twenty years, Myron and Violet lived together in seclusion in Bury St Edmunds, having [[Violet Tillyman's seven children|seven children]]. After Albert's death in [[1875]], Violet finally chose to resurface publicly, and she and Myron lived together happily for the rest of their lives.<ref name="PM"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*If Myron and Violet never married, as seems to be the case, this would make their seven children the only characters within [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' canon]] known to have been born to non-married parents, until the addition of [[Delphini]] in {{CC}}.
