'''Minister Maximilian Crowdy''' was [[Minister for Magic]] from [[1770s|1770]] to [[1781]], elected by the [[Great Britain|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Wizardkind|Wizarding]] population at least twice.  A father of nine, Crowdy was a charismatic leader who routed out several [[Pure-blood supremacy|extremist pure-blood]] groups planning [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] attacks. His mysterious [[death]] in office has been the subject of numerous books and conspiracy theories.<ref>{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>

==Biography==
Maximilian Crowdy was the sitting Minister for Magic in [[1777]], when [[United States of America|American]] wizards argued for and against interventionism in the [[Revolutionary War]]. When [[Elizabeth McGilliguddy|President Elizabeth McGilliguddy]] sought the advice of the Ministry of Magic to find out whether they intended to intervene on their side, Minister Crowdy replied with only a four-word message — "''Sitting this one out''". McGilliguddy replied back with an even shorter message — "''Mind you do''". Neither [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] or the Ministry of Magic intervened in the war.<ref name="PottermoreHistory3">[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/macusa Pottermore - Writing by J.K. Rowling: "The Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA)"]</ref>
