{{Quote|His classroom smelled strongly of garlic, which everyone said was to ward off a vampire he'd met in [[Romania]] and was afraid would be coming back to get him one of these days.|Description of [[Quirinus Quirrell]]'s D.A.D.A. classes.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
An alleged '''vampire in [[Romania]]''' was speculated by many of [[Professor]] [[Quirinus Quirrell]]'s students in the [[1991â€“1992 school year]] to be the reason for the strange smell of garlic that lingered in his [[Temporary Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom|classroom]].<ref>{{PS|B|8}}</ref> Even [[Rubeus Hagrid]] believed that a meeting with vampires in the [[Black Forest]] may have contributed to Quirrell's nervious behaviour and stuttering.<ref>{{PS|B|5}}</ref>
