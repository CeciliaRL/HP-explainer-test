{{Quote|I'd rather snog the [[Giant Squid]] than this.|This boy about detention|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
At some point by the [[1987–1988 school year]], he became the [[Seeker]] of his house's [[Quidditch team]]. He and other team members got into a confrontation with [[Jacob's sibling]] team, after [[Erika Rath]] injured [[Orion Amari]] in a [[Quidditch friendly]].<ref name="HMQch3">{{HM|4|Q3|1}}</ref>

After the match with Jacob's sibling's team, which ended in a brawl between the teams, this boy, along with the rest of the players, served detention under the supervision of [[Rolanda Hooch]]. The teams managed to prove their dedication to sportsmanship and cooperation and were not disqualified from the competition for the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup.<ref name="HMQch33">{{HM|4|Q3|3}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Which house he is in depends on that of [[Jacob's sibling]] (chosen by the player). If Jacob's sibling is in [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]] or [[Slytherin]], this boy is in [[Ravenclaw]]. If [[Jacob's sibling]] is in Ravenclaw, he is in Slytherin.
*His appearance resembles that of [[Brennan Doyle]]. However, Brennan Doyle is stated to be the [[Keeper]], not Seeker. Additionally, Brennan Doyle is always in Ravenclaw regardless of the player's house.<ref>{{HM|5|Poor Sport}}</ref>
