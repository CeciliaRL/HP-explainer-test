'''Professor Helbert Spleen''' was a [[Healer]] who worked at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]. He doubled as an advice columnist for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', answering only the questions which related to health, while [[Grizel Hurtz]], [[Zamira Gulch]], and [[Dempster Wiggleswade]] handled other topics.<ref name="DP">[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[1 June]], [[1999]], Problem Page</ref>

==Biography==
In one issue, Spleen replied to a letter from [[Howland Coopey]], diagnosing him with [[Dragon Pox]] based on the symptoms he described.<ref name="DP" />

During the [[Calamity]], a [[Calamity Investigator]] had a meal with Spleen, who showed them several ways to modify the harvesting, handling and incorporation of [[Dittany]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Spleen was a professional Healer, meaning he was very accomplished with medical [[magic]], such as with [[healing spell]]s, [[potion]]s and other magical remedies.<ref name="DP"/>
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Spleen was also skilled with handling and using magical medicinal plants, such as [[Dittany]], to which he showed a [[Calamity Investigator]] how to best harvest, handle and utilise the said plant.<ref name="WU"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*The ''Daily Prophet'' referred to Spleen by the title "Professor." This may indicate that he once taught at a wizarding school. This can be, however, just an academic title.<ref name="DP" />
