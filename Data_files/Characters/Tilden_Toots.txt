{{Quote|Hello and welcome back to "Toots, Shoots 'n' Roots" with me, Tilden Toots!|Tilden Toots opening his radio broadcast|J.K.Rowling Official Site}}
'''Tilden Toots''' (b. [[1959]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], who worked as a famous [[Herbologist]], [[Potioneer]], and radio personality and presenter.<ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}}</ref>

==Biography==
Tilden Toots was well-known for having three [[green thumb]]s, due to both having a wizarding condition and {{W|Polydactyly|radial polydactyly}} in his left hand.<ref name="JKRS" />

He hosted the ''[[Toots, Shoots 'n' Roots]]'' radio programme on the [[Wizarding Wireless Network]], and he produced his own line of plant-related [[potion]]s, such as [[Rejuicing Potion|Rejuicer]] and [[Regerminating Potion|Regerminator]].<ref name="JKRS" /> According to [[Severus Snape]], Toots built a fortune selling his potions.<ref name="HM626p">{{HM|6|26|p}}</ref>

He was married to bestselling author [[Daisy Hookum]].<ref name="JKRS"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Being a professional [[Herbologist]], Toots was a natural expert in the study of [[magic]]al plants and fungi. Toots hosted his own radio show on the subject of magical gardening, called ''[[Toots, Shoots 'n' Roots]]'', in which he gave considerable knowledge and advice to other wizards and witches in this field.<ref name="JKRS"/>
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Toots was also a professional [[Potioneer]], having invented at least two of his own gardening based potions, the [[Rejuicing Potion]] and [[Regerminating Potion]], showing his excellent skills in this field of [[magic]].<ref name="JKRS"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*On {{JKRS}}, Tilden Toots' radio show could sometimes be heard when one switched on the radio in Extra Stuff, prior to the site's redesign in [[2012]].
*If he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Toots might have been in the same year as the [[Marauders]], [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], and [[Severus Snape]]. If he was not, he was in the year ahead of them.
*He had a broad [[West Country]] accent as an adult, which suggests he spent the better part of his youth in the West Country where there are several magical settlements.
*his condition is a reference to the idiom "''to have a green thumb''", an expression used to describe someone's affinity or skill at gardening or growing plants.
