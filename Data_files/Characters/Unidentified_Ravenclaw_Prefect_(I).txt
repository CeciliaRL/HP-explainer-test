{{Quote|Ravenclaw, follow me!|The Prefect leads first-year [[Ravenclaw]] students to their [[Ravenclaw Tower|common room]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)}}
This '''unidentified Ravenclaw student''' began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the late [[1980s]] and eventually became a [[Prefect]] in the [[1990s]]. He led the [[First year|first-year]] students to their [[Ravenclaw Tower|common room]] in [[1991]].<ref name="PSF">{{PS|F}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*He goes down towards the [[Dungeons]], despite the [[Ravenclaw Tower|Ravenclaw common room]] being in a tower. However, the complex layout of the [[Grand Staircase]] is revealed with detail on the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{OOTP}}, and it could be possible for them to get down one floor to get to a stairway closer to the Ravenclaw common room and climb the stairs once more. Alternatively, it is possible for them to have gone through a shortcut in the [[Dungeons]], or to use one of the secret passages guarded by portraits. This is explained shortly after as they are seen going upstairs when [[Percy Weasley]] said to keep an eye on the staircases, and the screen moves upwards.
*The prefect is portrayed by [[Richard Alan Reid|Richard Reid]] in the film adaptation of {{PS}}.
*It is possible that this individual is [[Robert Hilliard]] as this boy looked very much like a fifth-year and they were both [[Ravenclaw]] [[Prefect]]s, and it was known that Hilliard welcomed the Ravenclaw first-years in Harry's year.
