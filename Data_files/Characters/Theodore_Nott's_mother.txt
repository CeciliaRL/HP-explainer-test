'''Mrs Nott''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]], the wife of [[Nott|Mr Nott]], and the mother of [[Theodore Nott]]. She died sometime after her son's birth in [[1979]] or [[1980]] but before his fifth year of 1995, leaving her elderly husband to raise Theodore on his own.<ref name="rowling" /> Theodore's ability to see [[Thestral]]s<ref name="OOTP21">{{OOTP|B|21}}</ref> may have originated in witnessing her death.

==Biography==
Her husband became one of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]] at some point before [[1971]]<ref name="HBP20">{{HBP|B|20}}</ref> and might have attended school with him as one of [[Tom Riddle's gang|his earliest Death Eaters]], but it is unknown when Mrs Nott attended school or if she supported the aims of Lord Voldemort, whether as a Death Eater herself or as a sympathiser like [[Narcissa Malfoy]].

It is unknown how or when she died. Considering her husband was described as "stooped" on [[24 June]] [[1995]]<ref name="GOF33">{{GOF|B|33}}</ref> and "very elderly" around the same time,<ref name="rowling" /> she might have been elderly herself and died of natural causes.
