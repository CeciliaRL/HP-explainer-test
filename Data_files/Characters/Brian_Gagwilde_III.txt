==Behind the scenes==
*Gagwilde may have died sometime prior to [[1991]], as many portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] depict deceased individuals. His clothing seems to suggest that he lived on the sixteenth or seventeenth century.
*Gagwilde's portrait seems to be a direct reference to [https://archive.is/20130623181951/ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/bacon/francis/portrait.jpg a portrait] of [[Wikipedia:Francis Bacon|Sir Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount of Saint Alban]].

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name "Brian" is not known for certain, but it is possibly related to the old Celtic element bre, meaning "hill", or by extension "high", "noble". It was borne by the semi-legendary Irish king Brian Boru, who thwarted Viking attempts to conquer Ireland in the 11th century. He was slain in the Battle of Clontarf, though his forces were decisively victorious. The name was common in Ireland before his time, and even more so afterwards. It came into use in England in the Middle Ages, introduced by Breton settlers. It subsequently became rare, but was revived in the 20th century.
