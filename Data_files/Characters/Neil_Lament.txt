==Etymology==
The name "Neil" is from the Gaelic name Niall, which is of disputed origin, possibly meaning "champion" or "cloud". This was the name of a semi-legendary 4th-century Irish king, Niall of the Nine Hostages.

==Behind the scenes==
*This character was presumably named in honour of [[Neil Lamont]], the supervising art director for the first six [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], from ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Philosopher's Stone]]'' to ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Half-Blood Prince]]''.<ref>"[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0483678/ Neil Lamont] on IMDb</ref>
*Based on the fact that he attended Hogwarts in the 1940s and being born around the 1930s, he was a few years below Tom Riddle during his time at Hogwarts.
