'''Goliath''' was a mercenary [[giant]] employed by the [[Philistines]] to fight for them in the [[Israelite-Philistine war|war]] they fought with the [[Israelites]] in [[Bible|Biblical]] times. He was ultimately slain by a [[Goliath's slayer|young boy]] armed only with a [[catapult]].<ref>''{{POA|G}} (Goliath [[Chocolate Frog Card|Famous Wizard Card]])</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Goliath is based on the {{w|Goliath|Biblical figure of the same name}}. In the book {{w|Books of Samuel|1 Samuel}} of the {{w|Old Testament}}, as a teenager, [[David (king)|King David]] slew the giant Goliath, but the [[Chocolate Frog Card]] for Goliath only refers to the giant's slayer as a "young boy" and does not explicitly name David. It is thus possible that Goliath was not slain by David in the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]].
*Giants in the ''Harry Potter'' universe are said to be between twenty and twenty five feet tall. According to a common interpretation of the Bible, Goliath was about 9 feet 9 inches, making him extremely short by giant standards (but still taller than the {{w|Robert Wadlow|tallest recorded human}}), suggesting that he may have been a [[Half-giant]]. Other interpretations place his height at about 6 feet 7 inches, a more realistic height for a human who was still extremely tall by the standards of the time, making the term "Giant" descriptive.
*Though David's weapon is sometimes depicted as a [[catapult]], historically it was more likely to have been a {{w|Sling (weapon)|sling}} weapon.
