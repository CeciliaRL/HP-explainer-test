==Biography==
===Millennium Bridge disaster===
{{Quote|The police are continuing with the investigation into the cause of the [[Millennium Bridge]] disaster. River traffic has been halted as police search for survivors. The surrounding area remains closed. The Mayor has urged Londoners to remain calm...|A [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] radio broadcast|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)}}

After the collapse of the [[Millennium Bridge]] at the hands of [[Fenrir Greyback]] and a group of [[Death Eaters]], the Mayor urged [[London]]ers to remain calm, for this was a most unusual event.<ref>{{HBP|F}} - Chapter 1</ref> He also addressed ''[[The Guardian]]'', where he described Londoners as having been left "''scared, confused and desperate for answers''" and pledging to uncover the truth behind the disaster (widely speculated among [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s to have been caused by a fundamentalist political group).<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The existence of this individual constitutes an anachronism as the office was created by the [[Wikipedia:Greater London Authority Act 1999|Greater London Authority Act 1999]] and the first Mayor of London, [[Wikipedia:Ken Livingstone|Ken Livingstone]], was elected in [[2000]].
*The Mayor's name is an obvious reference to [[David Yates]], the man who directed the last four [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' films]], including ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]''.
