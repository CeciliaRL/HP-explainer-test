During one particularly wet winter, Uric became convinced by the moaning of his Augureys that he had died and was now a ghost. His subsequent attempts to walk through the walls of his house resulted in what his biographer Radolphus Pittiman describes as a "concussion of ten days' duration."|[[Newton Scamander]], {{FB}}.|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (real)}}
