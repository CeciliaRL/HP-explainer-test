In the painting, Cragg is depicted as standing against a windowsill in the background, absorbed in reading while, in the foreground, [[Tobias Stump]] watches over a game of [[Wizard's Chess]] between [[Podric Piles]] and [[Uric Oapley]]. Cragg is depicted in black robes and matching pointy hat, with a voluminous powdered wig, and reading a book.
