As such, Bill had asked [[Albus Dumbledore]] permission to use [[Classroom 3C]] for tutoring students after daily classes were done.<ref name="HM65">{{HM|6|5}}</ref>

By the end of the year, this professor needed to be replaced because of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Jinx on the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher|jinx]] on the post.
