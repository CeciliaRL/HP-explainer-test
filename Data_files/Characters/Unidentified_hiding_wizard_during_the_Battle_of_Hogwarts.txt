This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who fought during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]]. He was hiding behind some stones at the [[Viaduct Courtyard]] [[Viaduct Courtyard Gatehouses|checkpoint towers]] when it exploded. It is possible that he was waiting for some Death Eater to pass by there, hoping to kill him from cover and without the risk of counter-attack. Another option is that he could be injured. It's unknown if he survived the battle.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>
