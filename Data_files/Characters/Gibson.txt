'''Mrs Gibson''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Muggle|No-Maj]] woman in the early [[20th century]].<ref name="fb-paper">"[http://www.gazette-du-sorcier.com/Compte-rendu-ouverture-de-l-exposition-Harry-Potter-a-Bruxelles-pour-Noel Compte-rendu : ouverture de l’exposition Harry Potter à Bruxelles pour Noël]" from the Gazette du Sorcier {{see image|File:New York Chronicle - Monday Dec 1926 (HQ).png}}</ref><ref name="eveningworld">[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030193/1922-11-21/ed-1/seq-1/ Front page of the 21 November 1922 issue of ''The Evening World''] from Chronicling America</ref>

==Biography==
Gibson was an important witness in the trial of [[Hall's wife|Mrs Hall]] for the [[14 September]] [[1926]] murders of [[Hall|Reverend Hall]] and [[Mills|Mrs Mills]].<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> She testified that she saw Mrs Hall on [[De Russey Lane]] with a male companion, presumed to be her accomplice, on the night of the murders, stating she was able to see their faces due to a passing [[car]].<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> [[George Sipel]] was subpoenaed to confirm Mrs Gibson's report that the vehicle was driven by him.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> She claimed that she heard that Sipel had told his friend, [[John Garry]], that he had seen her on the night of the murders.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> Sipel denied this allegation and reportedly showed a "frantic eagerness" to avoid testifying.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> Mrs Gibson reportedly recorded her sighting of Mrs Hall and her companion in her calendar diary.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> 

[[Nellie Lo Russell]] testified that, on the night of the murders, Mrs Gibson had visited her and spent time at her own home, thus seeming to indicate that she could not have seen Mrs Hall in De Dursey Lane.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> However, the testimony of Sipel apparently discredited this alternative testimony from Nellie Lo Russell.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" />

The trial was reported on in the [[6 December]] 1926 issue of the ''[[New York Chronicle]]''.<ref name="fb-paper" />

==Behind the scenes==
*The text of the article mentioning Mrs Gibson in the [[:File:New York Chronicle - Monday Dec 1926 (HQ).png|prop issue]] of the ''[[New York Chronicle]]'' featured in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' was taken from the real [[21 November]] [[1922]] issue of ''[[wikipedia:The Evening World|The Evening World]]''.<ref name="eveningworld" /> This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in [[1926]], but the actual events referenced occurred in 1922.
