'''Krall''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who lived during the early [[20th century]]. He was a member of [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s [[Alliance]], and was among the dark wizard's foremost acolytes.

In [[1927]], he accompanied his master to [[Paris]] and aided his efforts to recruit [[Credence Barebone]], but perished there when his dedication to Grindelwald's [[For the Greater Good|cause]] proved inadequate.<ref name="COG114">{{COG|S|114}}</ref>

==Biography==
Krall became a supporter of [[Gellert Grindelwald]] at some point prior to [[1927]] and became one of his [[Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes|acolytes]]. He travelled to [[Paris]] to help further Grindelwald's plans, where he expressed doubt that [[Credence Barebone]] was a match for [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Grindelwald bluntly asked him if he would stand by his side, and while Krall hastily confirmed he would, Grindelwald looked unconvinced of his honesty.

Krall attended Grindelwald's [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|rally]] at the [[Lestrange Mausoleum|Lestrange family Mausoleum]] in the [[Cimetière du Père-Lachaise]]. He was indirectly killed by his own master in [[1927]] when he failed to cross [[Protego Diabolica|enchanted fire]] that tested one's loyalty.<ref name="COG114" />

==Personality and traits==
Krall was described as being ''"sulky"'' and ''"ambitious"''.<ref name="deadline">[https://deadline.com/2017/09/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-sequel-david-sakurai-1202174793/ ‘Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them’ Sequel Adds David Sakurai] at [https://deadline.com Deadline.com]</ref> Despite siding with Grindelwald when he rose to power throughout the [[wizarding world]], Krall was conflicted and disillusioned with his decision, to an extent. His moral struggle did not go unnoticed by his master. When push came to shove, Krall's morals outweighed his lust for power, leading to his death in Grindelwald's fire.

[[File:Grindelwald Headshot COG.jpg|thumb|[[Gellert Grindelwald]], his former master and killer]]
Krall was initially loyal to Gellert Grindelwald, who once trusted him enough to include him among one of his acolytes. However, at some point, his loyalty had began to waver. Sensing this, Grindelwald had no qualms confronting him over it, bluntly asking whether he would stand by him as he collected Credence to use against Albus Dumbledore and not looking convinced when Krall tried to assure him. Ultimately, Krall died when crossing Grindelwald's ''[[Protego Diabolica]]'' due to his inadequate loyalty.

==Etymology==
*In a few Slavic languages, ''kral'' means "king", derived from the given name "Karl" (itself derived from Old Norse ''karl'', "free man"), ''i. e.'' Charlemagne.
**In Westrobothnian, it means "insects" or "that which crawls"
*''Kraal'' is an Afrikaans and Dutch word for an enclosure for cattle or other livestock surrounded by a fence of thorn-bush branches, a palisade, mud wall, or other fencing, roughly circular in form. It stems from the Portuguese ''curral'', found in English as ''corral''. 
*"Kralle" is German and means "claw" or "talon", possibly alluding to Krall's role as a henchman.
