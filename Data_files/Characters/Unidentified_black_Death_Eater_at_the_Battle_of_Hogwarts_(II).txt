This '''[[Dark Wizard]]''' (d. [[2 May]] [[1998]]) was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] who fought in the [[Second Wizarding War]]. He later fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. He survived the first round, and after [[Harry Potter|Harry]] [[Horcrux|sacrificed himself to]] [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in the [[Forbidden Forest]], he guarded the captured [[Rubeus Hagrid]] back to the castle along with other [[Death Eaters]], while Hagrid carried Harry's believed dead body. After Harry revealed that he was actually alive, the second round of the battle began. This Death Eater was then killed during the final stages of the battle.<ref>{{DH|F2}}</ref>
