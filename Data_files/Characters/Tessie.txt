'''Tessie''' was a great-aunt of the [[Weasley family|children]] of [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]] and [[Molly Weasley]]. In [[December]] of [[1994]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] commented that his [[Ronald Weasley's dress robes|dress robes]] for the [[Yule Ball]] made him look and smell like her.<ref>{{GOF|F}} - Chapter 17 (''The Yule Ball'')</ref> She may have owned [[Shell Cottage]] before [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]].

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|Look at this! Weasley, you weren't thinking of wearing these, were you? I mean — they were very fashionable in about eighteen ninety…|Draco Malfoy|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}

*In {{GOF}}, [[Draco Malfoy]] remarked on the fashionability of [[Ronald Weasley's dress robes|Ronald Weasley]]'s [[Ronald Weasley's dress robes|dress robes]]. If the remark is to be trusted, Tessie could presumably be born in the late [[19th century]]. 
*Interestingly, another Weasley relation named [[Muriel]] was born in [[1890]]. It was thought that she was a great-aunt of the Weasley children too and based on the approximate ages of Muriel and Tessie and their similar relation to the Weasley family, they might have been sisters. However, {{PM}} determined that Muriel was actually the great-great aunt of the Weasley children which makes Muriel more likely to be her aunt.
