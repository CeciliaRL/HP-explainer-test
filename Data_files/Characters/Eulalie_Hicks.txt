*"Eulalie" is the French form of "Eulalia", which is derived from Greek ''ευλαλος'' (eulalos) meaning "sweetly-speaking", itself from ''ευ'' (eu) "good" and ''λαλεω'' (laleo) "to talk".
*The surname "Hicks" is an English patronymic derived from "Hick", which is from the medieval personal name "Hicke", a pet form of "Richard" (meaning "powerful ruler"). "Hicks" is a widespread surname in England, and is common in the southwest and southern Wales.
