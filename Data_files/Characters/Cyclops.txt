'''Cyclops''' was a one-eyed [[Giant]] from Ancient [[Greece]]. He lived in a cave at the foot of [[Mount Etna]]. He was slain by the Greek hero, [[Odysseus]], who used several [[sheep]] to help him do this task.<ref>{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Cyclops is based on {{wplink|Polyphemus}}, a cyclops that appears in Greek mythology, most prominently in {{wplink|Homer}}'s ''{{wplink|Odyssey}}''. In the ''Odyssey'', Polyphemus was not slain by Odysseus, but merely blinded; and cyclopes are a separate species from giants.
