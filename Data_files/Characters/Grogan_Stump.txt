'''Minister Grogan Stump''' ([[1770]]-[[1884]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], who was the [[Minister for Magic]] from [[1811]] to [[1819]] and was very popular in the job. His legacy includes the creation of the [[Being Division|Being]], [[Beast Division|Beast]] and [[Spirit Division]]s of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], and the establishment of the [[Department of Magical Games and Sports]]. He was elected Minister by the wizarding population in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] at least twice.

==Biography==
[[File:Grogan Stump.jpg|160px|thumb|left|A younger Stump]]
===Early life===
Stump was born in [[1770]], somewhere in [[Great Britain]]<ref name="FWC" /> to at least one magical parent.<ref name="blood" /> He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from c. [[1781]] to [[1788]], where he was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]].<ref name="pottermore" />

===As Minister for Magic===
In [[1811]],<ref name="WOMBAT">Sixth question of the Third [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test|W.O.M.B.A.T.]] at {{JKRS}}</ref><ref name="PMministers">{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref> at age 41, Stump began his duties as a [[Minister for Magic]]. Stump particularly addressed the nomenclature of [[being]]s and [[beast]]s. He decreed that a being was "''any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws''", and by doing so, he settled a debate that had been going on in the wizarding world since the fourteenth century. Stump created the three divisions of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]: [[Being Division|Being]], [[Beast Division|Beast]], as well as later [[Spirit Division]]s.<ref name="FB">{{FB|R}}</ref>

It is likely<ref>Of all the possible answers for question 6-2 of the Third [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test|W.O.M.B.A.T.]] this seems to be the more likely: the ghosts were also initially put in the Being category but successfully "asserted" the need for a Spirit Division. The ghost demonstrations seem to fit with them being "assertive".</ref> that during Stump's tenure in office there were ghost demonstrations at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] (or "[[protest floats]]"), which caused Stump to create the aforementioned [[Spirit Division]].<ref name="WOMBAT" />

A passionate [[Quidditch]] fan, supporting the [[Tutshill Tornados]], Minister Stump also was responsible for establishing the [[Department of Magical Games and Sports]].<ref name="PMministers" />

Stump's term eventually ended in [[1819]], and he was succeeded by [[Josephina Flint]].<ref name="PMministers" />

==Behind the scenes==
*Grogan Stump's likeness, as featured on his ''[[Wizard of the Month]]'' entry, bears some (presumably coincidental) resemblance to former President of Portugal, [[Wikipedia:Aníbal Cavaco Silva|Aníbal Cavaco Silva]]. Interestingly, [[J. K. Rowling]] did live there in the early 1990s, at a time when Cavaco Silva was the Prime Minister. Rowling has previously stated that [[Salazar Slytherin]]'s first name was derived from [[Wikipedia:António de Oliveira Salazar|António de Oliveira Salazar]], who served as Prime Minister of Portugal from 1932 to 1968, ruling a fascist dictatorship.
