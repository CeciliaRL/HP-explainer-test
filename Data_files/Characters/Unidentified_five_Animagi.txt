These '''five people''' were [[Wizardkind|wizards or witches]] (or both) who were known to be registered [[Animagus|Animagi]]; however their animal forms are unknown. [[Hermione Granger]] referred to them by saying that there were only seven registered Animagi in the [[20th century]]. Since the [[Marauders]] trio ([[James Potter I|Prongs]], [[Sirius Black|Padfoot]] and [[Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]]) were unregistered, it is at least conceivable that others may have effected this transformation without registering.<ref>{{POA}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Unidentified registered Animagus|An unidentified Animagus]] appears in {{LEGO|Y1}}. She took the form of a black cat. As she changed shape in a public location, it is likely she was registered.<ref>{{LEGO 1}}</ref>
*It is possible that [[Jacob's sibling]] is one of them, as in the Animagus achievement quest in {{HM}}, the player gets to choose whether or not they want to register.
