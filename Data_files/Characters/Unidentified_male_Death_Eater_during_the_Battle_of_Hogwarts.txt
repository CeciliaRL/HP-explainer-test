{{Quote|No sign of him, [[Tom Riddle|my Lord]].|The Death Eater about Harry Potter|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2}}

This '''individual''' was a [[Dark Wizard]] and [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who served [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. It is likely he was later killed in the battle or incarcerated in Azkaban afterwards.
==Biography==
[[File:Screen_shot_2011-11-11_at_9.00.39_PM.png|thumb|This Death Eater shouting at Hagrid|alt=|left]]
This Death Eater took part at the [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor]]. He sat directly across from [[Severus Snape]], quite close to the seat of Voldemort.<ref>{{DH|F1}}</ref>[[File:TonyKirwood.png|thumb|left|The Death Eater sitting directly across from [[Severus Snape]] during the [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor]]]]

When [[Harry Potter]] went to the [[Forbidden Forest]], this man was one of the Death Eaters who stood guard and reported if Harry was anywhere to be seen. He was among the Death Eaters who watched Voldemort cast the [[Killing Curse]] on Harry. He later was present to witness Harry jumping from [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s arms in the [[Viaduct Courtyard]]. Following this, he flees from the battle once Harry was revealed to be alive. He presumably was arrested following Lord Voldemort's defeat or otherwise is on the run.<ref>{{DH|F2}}</ref>
==Physical Appearance==
The Death Eater had short brown hair and fairly large ears.

==Behind the scenes==

*This individual is portrayed by [[Peter G. Reed]] in {{DH|F1}} and {{DH|F2}}.
*In the book, [[Antonin Dolohov]] is the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] to say "No sign of him, my Lord." However in the scene of the [[Forbidden Forest]] in the film, this unidentified Death Eater is the man to say this line.
*In the book, [[Thorfinn Rowle]] is the Death Eater to say "QUIET!" to silence Hagrid in the Forbidden Forest, whilst in the film, this Death Eater says it instead.
*In a Behind the Scenes clip, this man is seen [[Apparition|Disapparating]], this probably means he fled the castle as the battle continued, meaning he was not one of the most faithful Death Eaters.
