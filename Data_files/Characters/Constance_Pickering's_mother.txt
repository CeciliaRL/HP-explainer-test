This '''[[Wizardkind|witch]]''' was the mother of [[Constance Pickering]].

==Biography==
Until the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] sent her a notice about permits and licencing, she used to make and sell batches of "special" [[pumpkin juice]] for grown-ups only.<ref name="WU"/>

During [[Christmas]], she and her [[Constance Pickering's sister|daughter]] pulled [[Christmas cracker|crackers]] together. The pop always made little Constance squeal with delight. The family were never able to have a tree at they house, because Constance's mum said she was "allergic" to decorating. Constance loved looking in their neighbours windows and seeing their trees, all bright and shiny.<ref name="WU"/>

Before the start of Constance's [[first year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], her mother wouldn't buy her a new cauldron. She gave Constance [[Constance Pickering's older brother|her brother]]'s old, used one and bought him a new one.<ref name="FirstYearAtHogwarts"/>

In [[2019]], the [[Pickering family]] had Christmas at the new house of Constance's sister, but they did not send Constance any details or address. As a result, Constance was invited to a Christmas dinner at the [[Potter family]]'s house instead.<ref name="WU"/>
