}}The '''Pidgron sisters''' were three [[Wizardkind|witches]] who had "quite a bit of padding in the bottom department".<sup><ref name="EveningProphet">See [[:File:EveningProphetFlyingFordAnglia.png|this image]] of an ''[[Evening Prophet]]'' prop used in {{COS|FA}}, taken at {{HPE}}.</ref></sup> They lived in Britain in the [[1990s]].

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|Luckily though no serious injuries were incurred. [[Felicitania Tugwood]] had the worst with a shocking flu after falling straight into the freezing cold Mersey. Luckily, the other flyers landed on something soft aswell ''[sic]'' as having quite a bit of padding in the bottom department. ''[â€¦]'' Apparently Dippet had dropped some of his shopping and was distracted by looking at his descending loaf of bread and crashed straight into Felicitania Tugwood and she in turn fell off her broomstick and knocked all three Pidgron sisters off their brooms on her way down to the Mersey.|''[[Evening Prophet]]'', [[1 September]], [[1992]]; ''[[Evening Prophet|Flying Ford Anglia Mystifies Muggles]]'', by [[Andy Smudgley]]|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)}}
*On ''[[Evening Prophet]]'' prop featured in {{COS|FA}}, the Pidgron sisters are mentioned to have been involved in a broom accident caused by [[Armando Dippet]] while [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley]] flew a [[Flying Ford Anglia|Ford Anglia]] to [[Hogwarts Castle]] (a breach of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]]): when elderly [[Armando Dippet]] dropped some bread from his broomstick, he lost his focus and accidentally crashed into [[Felicitania Tugwood]] who, in turn, managed to fall on the broomsticks of the Pidgron sisters, who were knocked off their brooms. While Tugwood fell into the [[River Mersey|Mersey]], the sisters fell on something soft and this, combined with the fact that had "quite a bit of padding in the bottom department", prevented them from having any injuries.<sup><ref name="EveningProphet" /></sup>
*This, however, cannot be considered [[canon]], since Rowling's statements and books imply that Dippet has been dead since the [[1950s]].
