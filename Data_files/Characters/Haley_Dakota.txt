==Etymology==
The name "Hayley" is from a surname which was originally derived from the name of an English town (meaning "hay clearing" from Old English ''heg'' "hay" and ''leah'' "clearing"). It was popularised by the British child actress Hayley Mills (1946-), though the name did not become common until over a decade after she first became famous.

The '''Dakota''' are the Santee branch of the Sioux people who traditionally lived in parts of Canada and the United States. There are many places and people named for the Dakota. Dakota, which refers both to the people and their language, is made up of two words - '''da''' meaning "considered" or "to think of as ..." and '''koda''' meaning "friend", "companion", "friendly" or "friendship." The name Dakota translates literally as "considered friend" and came to mean "friendly", "allies", "allied","ally" or "the allied ones." Earlier spellings of Dakota include Dakhota and Dakotah.

Dakota, the earliest of the three, is linguistically related to the other two dialetical branches Lakota and Nakota (i.e. Assiniboine). Instead of '''koda''', the Lakota use the word '''kola''' and the Nakota use the word '''kona''' to denote a friend or ally. The Lakota also use the word '''ko''' to mean "included" which may indicate that '''kola''', along with '''kona''' and '''koda''' may, themselves, be compound words. Lakota is listed as meaning "alliance of friends".
