}}'''Dave Monk''' was a reporter for ''[[Metro]]'', a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] newspaper. He wrote the front-page article of the [[12 August]], [[1995]] issue, about the birth and recovery of his two sons, [[Tom Monk|Tom]] and [[Jack Monk|Jack]], who were delivered prematurely.<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:Metro.png|this image]])</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*David Monk is the deputy editor of the British newspaper ''[[Metro]]'' in real life.<ref>"[https://shipmonk.co.uk/about/ About]" from Shipmonk</ref> He wrote a blog post explaining that newspapers are sometimes asked to create mock front pages to be used in film and television productions. A preliminary front-page mock-up featuring a fake article was given to ''Metro'' by the ''Harry Potter'' production team. Monk tweaked the design so that it looked more like a genuine issue of ''Metro'', and added his own name to the mock article's byline, as the original author had not included one. He does not have a wife named Tilly or twin sons named Jack and Tom.<ref>"[https://shipmonk.co.uk/2014/03/15/how-i-discovered-my-secret-double-life-in-the-harry-potter-universe/ How I discovered my secret double life in the Harry Potter universe]" from Shipmonk</ref>
