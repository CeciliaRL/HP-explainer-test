'''Sir Sidley Smirk Platter'''<ref name="LE">{{HPLE}}</ref>, <small>[[Grand Sorcerer|Grand Sorc.]]</small>, (born c. [[1503]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was appointed [[Supreme Mugwump]] of the [[International Confederation of Wizards]] sometime after [[Pierre Bonaccord]].<ref name="portrait" />

Smirk Platter was depicted in a [[portrait]] that hung somewhere at [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="portrait" /> This portrait was painted in [[1542]], when he was 39 years old, as indicated by the inscription "Anno Etatis Suae 39"<ref name="portrait" /> (''anno aetatis suae'' is a Latin term meaning "in the year of his age"<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Latin_phrases:_A List of Latin Phrases: A]" on Wikipedia</ref>).

==Behind the scenes==
*This portrait was made specifically for the [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' films]], and was modelled after [[Matt Cooke]],<ref>[http://www.flickr.com/photos/tonyridder/7537611422/ The Making of Harry Potter photo] on Flickr</ref> a member of the dressing props team since ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]''.
*Despite bearing Matt Cooke's likeness, this portrait seems to have been based on a [http://www.elizabethan-portraits.com/HenryWriothesley2.jpg portrait of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton (c. 1600)], by an unknown artist.
*Smirk Platter may have passed away sometime prior to the [[1990s]] as many portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] depict deceased individuals.
