This '''[[Wizardkind|witch]]''' (b. [[1979]]-[[1980]]) attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as a [[Gryffindor]] from [[1991]] onwards, and was a classmate of [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="POAF"/>

In her [[third year]], she took [[Divination (class)|Divination]] and [[Care of Magical Creatures]] as her electives.<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}}</ref> Providing she was not a [[Muggle-born]], she presumably graduated in [[1998]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
The red-haired witch was born in [[1979]] or [[1980]], to presumably a [[Wizardkind|wizarding]] family.

She received her [[Hogwarts acceptance letter]] in [[1991]], and began her first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[1 September]], that same year.

===Education at Hogwarts===

====Third year====
[[File:Witch grounds.png|100px|thumb|left|The witch on Hogwarts grounds]]
[[File:Ginger and neville.png|150px|thumb|right|The girl with [[Neville Longbottom]]]]
After the summer holidays in [[1993]], this girl returned to Hogwarts for the [[1993â€“1994 school year]], though this time [[Dementor]]s were standing guard at every entrance. She performed with the [[Frog Choir]] at the [[1993]] [[Start-of-Term Feast]] in the [[Great Hall]].<ref name="POAF"/>

She took [[Divination (class)|Divination]] and [[Care of Magical Creatures]] as her elective subjects in her [[third year]].<ref name="POAF"/>

[[File:Booking.png|150px|thumb|left|The girl and her friend in [[Care of Magical Creatures]]]]
During her first [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lesson, she and other students were told that their copies of ''[[The Monster Book of Monsters]]'', which had bitten them, had to be stroked in order to open. When [[Professor]] [[Rubeus Hagrid]] introduced the [[Hippogriff]] [[Buckbeak]], she, along with the rest of the class, did not seem to be able to believe her eyes. After Hagrid asked for a volunteer, the Gryffindor girl was afraid and stepped back, leaving [[Harry Potter]] to interact with Buckbeak instead. She watched apprehensively alongside Hermione and [[Neville Longbottom]], and applauded happily after Harry flew the Hippogriff. Unfortunately for him, Malfoy insulted Buckbeak, who proceeded to attack him. The Gryffindor girl ran and hid behind a rock with her best-friend and Parvati. The class was dismissed while Hagrid took Malfoy to [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] in the [[Hospital Wing]].<ref name="POAF"/>

In her first [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] lesson of the year, her and other Gryffindors were taught about [[Boggart]]s by [[Remus Lupin]], the new teacher as of [[Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]]'s departure, and had a practical lesson on how to [[Boggart-Banishing Spell|banish]] them. The girl faced the Boggart, and it frightened her by turning into either a [[rat]], [[rattlesnake]] or eyeball.<ref name="POA7"/>

The Gryffindor girl was later present during the lesson that Hermione, after being insulted by Professor Trelawney, stormed out of the class. At the time, she was crystal-gazing with her friend, and looked up in surprise after Hermione left. She returned to her work straight away, and was later the last person out of the classroom. On the [[Divination Stairwell|Divination staircase]], she walked with a boy, rather than with her friend, who was ahead of her with another girl. Harry, who was returning to the classroom, accidentally walked into the girl, and said sorry.<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}}</ref>

The girl watched Harry Potter fly on his [[Firebolt]] and cheered happily.<ref name="POAF"/>

==Physical description==
[[File:Girl headshot.png|120px|thumb|right|The girl standing behind Hermione Granger]]
This girl had red hair, which, during her Hogwarts years, she often wore as plaits. She had blue eyes and white skin, and wore her school uniform very neatly. Unlike her friend, during her magical creatures class in her third year, she did not take off her robe, but she did take off her jumper and tie it around her waist. She was considerably shorter than fellow Gryffindor [[Neville Longbottom]], and was slightly shorter than [[Hermione Granger]].<ref name="POAF"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*[[J. K. Rowling]] has been asked about the two unidentified girls in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|third film]] in three interviews. She said their names were in her notebook, and promised twice to post them on her [[J. K. Rowling's official site|website]], but has not as of yet.<ref name="wbd">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0304-wbd.htm 2004 World Book Day chat]</ref><ref name="leaky">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm 16 July, 2005 Leaky Cauldron/Mugglenet interview]</ref><ref name="pottercast">[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2008/1/2/pottercast-131-j-k-rowling-interview-transcript December 2007 PotterCast interview]</ref> Even if she does, it will be impossible to say which name belongs to which girl.
*The girls' names may have already appeared partially on the class list shown on {{HPM}}.
*It is highly likely that the girl was [[Alice Tolipan (witch)|Alice Tolipan]], the individual who joined [[Dumbledore's Army]]. If not, then she and her friend were the only Gryffindors in their year not to join the group.
*Other possible identities include [[Sally-Anne Perks]], [[Lily Moon]], [[Sophie Roper]], [[Sally Smith]], or [[Runcorn]].
*She is portrayed by [[Danielle Downey]] in {{POA|FA}}.
