'''Belvina Burke''' (née '''Black''') ([[1880s|1886]]–[[1962]]) was a [[pure-blood]] witch and member of the noble [[House of Black]].

==Biography==
Belvina was born in [[1886]]. She was the only daughter of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] (Headmaster of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]) and [[Ursula Flint]]. She was also the sister of [[Sirius Black II|Sirius II]], [[Cygnus Black II|Cygnus II]], [[Phineas Black|Phineas]] and [[Arcturus Black II|Arcturus]]. She married [[Herbert Burke]], and they had three children: [[Belvina Burke's sons|two sons]] and [[Belvina Burke's daughter|a daughter]].<ref name="BFT" />

==Etymology==
The name ''Belvina'' does not fit in with the [[House of Black|Black family]] tradition of naming its members after stars or constellations. It may derived from Latin, in which it would mean something like "lovely wine" or "fair one". Alternatively, it could be derived from Beltane, an ancient Celtic holiday related to [[Wikipedia:Walpurgis Night|Walpurgis Night]], "Witches' Night".<ref>[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/blackfamily.html Harry Potter Lexicon: Black Family]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on a statement by [[Horace Slughorn]], Belvina may have been a member of the [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. However, she attended Hogwarts c. 1897 - 1904, when Slughorn was not Potions teacher.
*It is possible that she was related to [[Elizabeth Burke]] by marriage.
*It is also possible that [[Araminta Meliflua Black|Araminta Meliflua]] was her granddaughter, since she was described as a cousin of [[Walburga Black]] (Belvina's great-niece) and then it can be assumed that they were in the same generation.
