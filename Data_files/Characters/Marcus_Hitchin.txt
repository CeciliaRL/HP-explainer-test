'''Marcus Hitchin''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Ravenclaw]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].

==Biography==
He was known to have used [[Fred and George Weasley]]'s [[Skiving Snackbox]]es. Unlike most people who considered [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]] a placeholder, Trevor thought that he was a good teacher. One day, Slughorn was [[duelling]] Marcus and beat him. The blow was so powerful that he needed two days in the [[Hospital Wing]] to recover. He was a fan of [[Gilderoy Lockhart]].<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Marcus" is a Roman praenomen, or given name, which was probably derived from the name of the Roman god Mars. Famous Roman bearers of this name were Marcus Tullius Cicero (known simply as Cicero), a 1st-century BC statesman and orator, Marcus Antonius (known as Mark Antony), a 1st-century BC politician, and Marcus Aurelius, a notable 2nd-century emperor.
