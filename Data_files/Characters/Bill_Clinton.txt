==Behind the scenes==
*In keeping with the [[Dating conventions|''Harry Potter'' timeline]], Bill Clinton would be President of the United States at the time of the [[Millennium Bridge]] disaster of 1996. However, the same prop that mentions Bill Clinton also establishes that [[George W. Bush]] is serving as President. 
*The date on the newspaper is [[5 July]], 2007, and all of the articles, other than the fictional one about the Millennium Bridge, are real news stories from that year. This, and other such details, place the film series timeline at about 10 years after the book's, roughly contemporaneously with the film series release
