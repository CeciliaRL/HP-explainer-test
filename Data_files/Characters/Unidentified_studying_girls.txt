{{Quote|Hello!|[[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] passing the girls|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)}}

These '''three girls''' were [[Wizardkind|witches]] and students at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. They were seen studying and poring over books while they stood by the statue of the [[first Headmaster of Hogwarts]]. [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] then passed them, and they looked up briefly before returning to their reading. [[Percy Weasley]] and [[Penelope Clearwater]] then passed them as well.
