This '''[[Merpeople|merman]]''' fell in [[love]] with a young [[Wizardkind|witch]], [[Mirabella Plunkett]].<ref name="PSG"/><ref name="COSG"/><ref name="POAG"/>

==Biography==
This merman lived in the waters of [[Loch Lomond]], [[Scotland]]. At some point in his life, he met the young [[Wizardkind|witch]], [[Mirabella Plunkett]] who was on holiday in the area, and two subsequently fell in [[love]]. However, due to Mirabella being a [[human]] and him being a merman, Mirabella's parents strongly objected to their relationship and forbade her to marry him. However in response, Mirabella [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] herself into a [[haddock]], and was never seen by humans again. Therefore, it is possible that the two later married with them both inhabiting the [[water]]s as aquatic creatures.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>
