'''Susanna Hesleden''' was a [[Ravenclaw]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]]. Susanna was a fan of [[Gilderoy Lockhart]], and was known to send him letters daily.

==Etymology==
The name "Susanna" is from Σουσαννα (Sousanna), the Greek form of the Hebrew name שׁוֹשַׁנָּה (Shoshannah). This was derived from the Hebrew word שׁוֹשָׁן (shoshan) meaning "lily" (in modern Hebrew this also means "rose"), perhaps ultimately from Egyptian sšn "lotus".
