'''Regulus Black''' ([[1906]] – [[1959]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], the youngest child of [[Sirius Black II]] and [[Hesper Gamp]] and brother of [[Arcturus Black III]] and [[Lycoris Black|Lycoris]]. Regulus never married and never had children.<ref name="BFT" />

==Etymology==
Members of the [[House of Black]] and their history seem to have made a tradition of naming their children after stars and constellations. In Latin, ''regulus'' means "little king" and was one term for a [[basilisk]]. As a name, it has also been applied to the star [[Wikipedia:Regulus|Alpha Leonis]], which is situated at the heart of the lion in the constellation [[Wikipedia:Leo (constellation)|Leo]]. Regulus was also the family name of a Roman general, Marcus Atilius Regulus, who was known for his honour and self-sacrifice.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulus_%28disambiguation%29 Wikipedia: Regulus]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on a statement by [[Horace Slughorn]], Regulus may have been a member of the [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. However, he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] c. [[1917]] - [[1924]], when Slughorn may not have been Potions master.
*Regulus was the granduncle of [[Regulus Black|another Black called Regulus]].
