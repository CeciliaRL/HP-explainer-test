==Biography==
===Early life===
This girl was born in either [[1979]] or [[1980]]. She started her [[first year]] of [[magic]]al education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]], and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]].<ref name="POAF"/> She shared a dormitory in [[Gryffindor Tower]] with [[Lavender Brown]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Parvati Patil]] and [[Unidentified Gryffindor girl (1993-1994) (II)|another girl]]. She and the ginger girl befriended, while Parvati and Lavender grew close and Hermione gradually became friends with [[Harry Potter]] and [[Ronald Weasley]].

===Third year===
In her [[third year]] in [[1993]], the girl chose [[Care of Magical Creatures]] and [[Divination (class)|Divination]] as her elective subjects.<ref name="POAF"/>

In her first [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] lesson, she and her [[Gryffindor]] classmates were taught about [[Boggart]]s by [[Remus Lupin]], the new teacher as of [[Gilderoy Lockhart|Professor Lockhart]]'s departure, and had a practical lesson on how to [[Boggart-Banishing Spell|banish]] them. She faced the Boggart, and it frightened her by becoming either a [[rat]], [[rattlesnake]] or eyeball, the other two belonging to her friend and to Lavender.<ref name="POA7"/>

[[File:Care of magical creatures class 1993.jpg|251x251px|thumb|The girl in a Care of Magical Creatures lesson]]

During the first [[Care of Magical Creatures]], which she went with her friend, they were told that their copies of ''[[The Monster Book of Monsters]]'', which had bitten them, had to be stroked in order to open. When [[Rubeus Hagrid|Professor Hagrid]], who took Kettleburn's place after he resigned, introduced the [[Hippogriff]] [[Buckbeak]], the girl, along with the rest of the class, did not seem to be able to believe her eyes. After Hagrid asked for a volunteer, she was afraid and stepped back, leaving [[Harry Potter]] to interact with Buckbeak instead. She watched apprehensively behind Hermione and [[Ronald Weasley]], and applauded happily after Harry flew the Hippogriff. Unfortunately for him, Malfoy insulted Buckbeak, who proceeded to attack him. The girl ran and hid behind a rock with her best-friend and Parvati. The class was dismissed while Hagrid took Malfoy to [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] in the [[Hospital Wing]].<ref name="POAF"/>

The girl went to [[Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade Village]], on at least the first weekend they were allowed, and went with a girl other than her friend, as she may not have been able to go.<ref name="POAF"/>

The girl was later present during the Divination lesson that Hermione, after being insulted by [[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]], stormed out of the class. At the time, she was crystal-gazing with her friend, and looked up in surprise after Hermione left. She returned to her work straight away, and was later one of the last out of the classroom. On the [[Divination Stairwell|Divination staircase]], she walked with another girl, rather than her friend, who walked into [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="POAF"/>

==Physical description==
She was considerably taller than her friend, with brown hair which reached her shoulder blades. She had blue eyes and often wore her uniform tidily, though she took off her jumper and robe during one [[Care of Magical Creatures]] lesson and carried them around on her arm. Occasionally, she wore her hair in pigtails, like her friend.<ref name="POAF"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*[[J. K. Rowling]] has been asked about the two unidentified girls in in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|third film]], in three interviews. She said their names were in her notebook, and promised twice to post them on her [[J. K. Rowling's official site|website]], but has not as of yet.<ref name="wbd">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0304-wbd.htm 2004 World Book Day chat]</ref><ref name="leaky">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm 16 July, 2005 Leaky Cauldron/Mugglenet interview]</ref><ref name="pottercast">[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2008/1/2/pottercast-131-j-k-rowling-interview-transcript December 2007 PotterCast interview]</ref> Even if she does, it will be impossible to say which name belongs to which girl.
*The girls' names may have already appeared partially on the class list shown on {{HPM}}.
*It is highly likely that the girl was either [[Alice Tolipan]] or [[Luca Caruso (wizard)|Luca Caruso]], the two unknown individuals who joined [[Dumbledore's Army]]. If not, then she and her friend were the only Gryffindors in their year not to join the group.
*Other possible identities include [[Sally-Anne Perks]], [[Lily Moon]], [[Sophie Roper]], [[Sally Smith]], or [[Runcorn]].
*She is portrayed by an unidentified actress in {{POA|FA}}.
