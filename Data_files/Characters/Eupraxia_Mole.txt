'''Professor Eupraxia Mole''' was [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1870s]].<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|peeves}}</ref>

==Biography==
In [[1876]], caretaker [[Rancorous Carpe]] devised an "[[Rancorous Carpe's trap|elaborate trap]]" in an effort to remove [[Peeves]], the resident [[Poltergeist]], from the [[Hogwarts Castle|Castle]], which failed. The Castle had to be evacuated for three days as Peeves amused himself by firing weapons randomly and threatening the students with death.<ref name="pottermore"/>

Professor Mole agreed to sign a [[Peeves' contract|contract]] with Peeves, so that he relinquished the weapons in exchange for additional privileges: a once-weekly swim in the boys' toilets on the ground floor, first refusal on stale bread from the kitchen for throwing purposes, as well as a new custom-made hat by [[Bonhabille|Madame Bonhabille]].<ref name="pottermore"/>
