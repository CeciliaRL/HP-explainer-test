The '''Dark Witch from Knockturn Alley''' was a high-ranking member of a dangerous organisation known as [[R]].<ref name="HM715">{{HM|7|15}}</ref>

==Biography==
===1988–1989 school year===
During the [[1988–1989 school year]], when [[Jacob's sibling]] and a friend visited [[Knockturn Alley]], she prevented them from entering [[Borgin and Burkes]] and asked for a sacrifice. She duelled them and attracted more witches and wizards. However, [[Patricia Rakepick]] arrived in time and defeated them, including the witch.<ref name="HM510"/>

===1989–1990 school year===
During the [[1989–1990 school year]], she attended a secret meeting of [[R]], which [[Jacob's sibling]] infiltrated impersonating [[Patricia Rakepick]] using [[Polyjuice Potion]]. When the real Rakepick [[Apparition|Apparated]] onto the scene, she helped her fight Jacob's sibling's team.<ref name="HM635"/>

At some point near the end of the school year, she was seen in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] and was unknowingly eavesdropped by Jacob's sibling and [[Mundungus Fletcher]] while talking about meeting someone later. In [[Knockturn Alley]], she met [[Merula Snyde]], who was ready to join [[R]]. Then she transformed into her original look and took Merula with her.<ref name="HM645">{{HM|6|45}}</ref>

===1990–1991 school year===
During the [[1990–1991 school year]], originally disguised as [[Wilkie Twycross]], she revealed herself during a meeting with [[Zenith Xeep]] in [[Knockturn Alley]] and talked about [[Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution]] and the [[Wand stolen by Zenith Xeep|wand Zenith had stolen]] from [[Ollivanders]]. When Zenith was about to give her the wand, [[Ben Copper]], who had been secretly watching with [[Jacob's sibling]], interrupted them, and the Dark Witch used the [[Stunning Spell]] on him. When Jacob's sibling also emerged, she [[Apparition|Disapparated]].<ref name="HM714">{{HM|7|14}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': As a [[Dark Wizard|Dark Witch]], she was highly proficient in dark magic.<ref name="HM510"/><ref name="HM635"/> She was capable of performing the [[Slug-vomiting Charm]] proficiently.<ref name="HM510"/>
*'''[[Duelling]]''': She was an excellent duellist, as she held her own against [[Nymphadora Tonks]].<ref name="HM635"/>
*'''[[Apparition]]''': She was able to Apparate at will.<ref name="HM635"/>
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': She was able to transform herself into a different look instantly, but the true nature of this transformation was unknown.<ref name="HM645"/> It is possible that she was a [[Metamorphmagus]] (possibly the [[Unidentified Metamorphmagus|Metamorphmagus who infiltrated the Ministry]] in the [[1990–1991 school year]]) who could change her appearance at will, or that she simply used advanced [[Human Transfiguration]] to change her appearance on sudden notice.
