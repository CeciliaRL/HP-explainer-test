'''Mauricius''' (born c. [[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was friends with [[Vincent Crabbe]] and, in early [[1995]], took part in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' campaign to harass [[Rubeus Hagrid]].<ref name="DP">See [[:File:Daily Prophet Flying Pigs.jpg|this image]].</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] student was only mentioned on a ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' prop in {{GOF|FA}}. The text on the prop appears to be a copy of the "DUMBLEDORE'S GIANT MISTAKE" article featured in the novel (chapter twenty-four), however, in the prop Rubeus Hagrid's name is replaced by "[[Eduardo]]", "he" and "him", and Draco Malfoy's is replaced by "Mauricius".
