{{Quote|Angus Buchanan became world-famous among wizards whilst also being celebrated among Muggles, a hitherto unknown achievement. Wizards of many nationalities began turning up to watch him play sport.|Angus' achievement in Muggle sport|Pottermore}}
'''Angus Buchanan''' ([[15 January]], [[1847]] – [[21 February]], [[1927]])<ref name="Wikipedia"/> was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Squib]]. He was the son of [[pure-blood]]s [[John Buchanan|John]] and [[Mary Buchanan]] {{Comment|née Proctor}}. He grew up in a household comprised of eleven children. Angus became famous in the both the [[wizarding world|wizarding]] and [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] worlds.

Angus was the only Squib to take part in the [[Sorting ceremony]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and later became a player on the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Scottish rugby team]]. This association was responsible for wizards' part in-joke interest in rugby, and worldwide wizarding support of the Scottish team.<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|scottish-rugby}}</ref>
Later in Angus' life he published ''[[My Life as a Squib]]'', a groundbreaking worldwide bestseller that brought the plight of Squibs to the wizarding world's attention. After his death, he was honoured by both [[wizardkind|wizards]] and [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s (an almost unique achievement in history). To this day, the [[Wizarding Supporters of Scottish Rugby Union]] meet on the eve of every Scottish international match to toast Buchanan's memory.<ref name="Pottermore" />

==Biography==
===Early life===
Angus Buchanan was born on [[15 January]], [[1847]],<ref name="Wikipedia"/> to the [[Pure-blood]] [[Buchanan family]], in a village in the [[Scottish Borders]]. He grew up in a household comprised of an[[Angus Buchanan's mother| overworked mother]], a[[Angus Buchanan's father| fierce father]], and [[Angus Buchanan's siblings|eleven children]]. He was the third son, the largest and kindest of them all.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

Angus spent much of his early childhood dodging [[curse]]s on an almost daily basis. However, he enjoyed a good relationship with his brothers and sisters, who were all very fond of him — he would, years later, attribute his aptitude for [[cricket]] to the years of helping his siblings catch [[Golden Snitch]]es in their back garden.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

The household was, naturally, loud and chaotic, which perhaps accounts for neither of the Buchanan parents realising that Angus was actually born a [[Squib]]. Since Mr Buchanan senior was highly prejudiced against Squibs (which he regarded as a severe anomaly and a sign the family was in decline), the brothers and sisters covered up for him in front of his parents. As the time approached for him to leave to attend [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], his sister [[Flora Buchanan|Flora]] forged an [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|acceptance letter]] and Angus, frightened of his father, played along, going as far as going to [[Diagon Alley]] and buying a [[wand]] by pretending it had chosen him.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

===Estrangement with his family===
On [[1 September]], [[1858]], it was supposedly the appointed day for him to start at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Angus' older brother [[Hamish Buchanan|Hamish]] took him to the Castle on the back of [[Hamish Buchanan's broomstick|his broomstick]], hoping against desperate hope that the faculty would allow him to stay once he got there, or that the school would tease some magic out of him.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

For the first and only time in history, a [[Squib]] was among the crowd of [[first year|first-years]] about to be [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]]. In sheer desperation, Angus threw himself ahead of a[[Girl Sorted in 1858| girl]] whose name had been called, and placed the [[Sorting Hat]] upon his head. The Hat announced kindly that he was "''a good-hearted chap, but no wizard''", and the boy left the hall in tears.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

Angus went back home on foot, where he was met by his humiliated father who had already received a flurry of [[owl]]s about what had happened. Mr Buchanan senior barred his entrance, bade him to go away, and fired [[curse]]s after Angus as he fled.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

Without family or money, the eleven-year-old Angus Buchanan walked to the capital, [[Edinburgh]], occasionally hitching rides on carts. Once there, he lied about his age and was taken in by a kind [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] foreman and his wife who did not have children of their own, who gave him work as a labourer. During the seven years that followed, Angus found out that Muggles were not nearly as bad as his father and mother had always told him, and grew into a strong man admired for his kind nature and his physical prowess.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

===Sporting career===
{{Quote|A Beater who is unable to fly defends three sticks instead of a hoop, while a Snitch without wings is thrown at the sticks. That’s it. Sometimes for several days.|''[[Daily Prophet]]''|Pottermore}}
Angus Buchanan found his greatest pleasure in athleticism, and soon became adept at [[Rugby Union|rugby]], a then relatively new [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] sport. He was surprisingly nimble (perhaps due to his childhood years of dodging [[curse]]s). He also found out to be a natural at [[cricket]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>

In [[1871]], he was part of [[Scottish rugby team|his country's team]] in the first-ever international rugby match between Scotland and England. Among the spectators were [[Angus Buchanan's siblings|all ten of his brothers and sisters]], who had set out to meet him in defiance of their father's injunction against ever seeing Angus again. Elated to see them, Angus scored the first try and Scotland won the match. The sporting career that followed made him celebrated among [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

===Later life===
[[File:My-life-as-a-squib-lrg.png|thumb|left|''[[My Life as a Squib]]'', on its 110th printing by [[2014]]]]
He reevaluated his relationship with his magical roots following this reunion with his family. In [[1900]], he published an immensely successful autobiography titled ''My Life as a Squib''. The book brought the plight of the Squibs to the [[wizardkind|wizarding world]]'s attention — Squibs had, until that point, always lived in the shadows: cast between the wizarding world, where they did not fit in and always felt second-class, and the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] society, in which they had to bitterly cut all ties to wizards. Buchanan's life story, however, showed that it was possible to succeed in life despite all those hardships he had been subjected to.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

[[Wizardkind|Wizards]] of many nationalities started to turn up to watch Buchanan play sport. Even though wizards enjoyed watching [[Rugby Union|rugby]] (their enjoyment had a bit of a sadistic edge, as they admired the strength and courage of Muggles who submitted themselves to a sport so brutal, without being able to [[Apparition|Disapparate]] out of the way, or access to [[Skele-Gro]] to mend broken bones), [[cricket]] found little favour among them (they regarded it as a very inferior version of [[Quidditch]]).<ref name="Pottermore"/>

===Death and post-mortem===
{{Quote|When Angus Buchanan died, he was honoured by both wizarding and Muggle worlds, an almost unique achievement in the annals of history. A shining example of a person who had made the most of the hand that life had dealt them and emerged triumphant, Angus was too modest to realise the impact that he had had.|Angus' legacy|Pottermore}}Angus Buchanan died on [[21 February]], [[1927]], at the age of 80.<ref name="Wikipedia"/> After his death, he was honoured by both the wizarding and Muggle worlds, a very rare thing indeed throughout history. At Hogwarts, the [[Angus Buchanan Cup for Outstanding Effort]] was set up as an annual accolade. By [[2014]], ''[[My Life as a Squib]]'' was on its one-hundred-and-tenth edition.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

The [[Wizarding Supporters of Scottish Rugby Union]] was founded shortly after Buchanan's death and they, to this day, gather on the eve of every Scottish international match to toast Angus's memory and anticipate eighty minutes of watching [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s trample each other into the mud.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

It is considered ''infra dig'' for [[wizardkind|wizards]] of any nationality to support any rugby team other than Scotland. Because of this fact, it has become a common way of identifying wizards in public by the fact that they will, regardless of nationality, be willing to speak of Scottish rugby.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Intentionally or not, {{PM}} was updated to include Rowling's new piece of information about Buchanan and the Scottish rugby team on [[21 February]], [[2014]], the 87th anniversary of Angus Buchanan's death.
*If [[Phineas Nigellus Black]]'s month of birth was before September, then he would have been among the crowd of first-years who were to be [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] when Buchanan tried on the [[Sorting Hat]].
*According to {{PM}}, Angus Buchanan was born in a small town in the Scottish Borders. The real Angus Buchanan, however, was born in [[Argyllshire]].<ref>[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XYK5-Q6P "Scotland, Births and Baptisms, 1564-1950," index, FamilySearch, Angus Buchanan, 15 Jan 1847]</ref> He also had eleven siblings, not ten, none of which were named Flora or Hamish.<ref>[https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&query=%2Bgivenname%3AJohn~%20%2Bsurname%3ABuchanan~%20%2Bspouse_givenname%3AMary~%20%2Bspouse_surname%3AProctor~%20%2Brecord_country%3AScotland Search results for John Buchanan - FamilySearch.org]</ref>
