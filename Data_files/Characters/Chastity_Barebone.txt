'''Chastity Barebone''' (d. [[7 December]], [[1926]]<ref name="deathdate" />) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] who lived during the 20th century. She was the adopted daughter of [[Mary Lou Barebone]]. Mary Lou was the leader of the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]], a [[No-Maj]] anti-witchcraft group. 

Chastity was the middle child of three adopted siblings. Her other siblings were [[Credence Barebone]] and [[Modesty Barebone]].<ref>[https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062571328/inside-the-magic-the-making-of-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them Inside the Magic: The Making of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them] (see [https://68.media.tumblr.com/00de37b74c711816f61d551b29f8e295/tumblr_ok8dtlgSKy1sq6uv2o1_540.jpg image])
</ref> And she lived with them and her adoptive mother in the [[United States of America]] in [[1926]] at the [[Second Salem Church]] in [[Pike Street]] [[Manhattan]]. 

Chastity dutifully abided by her mother's strict rules, unlike her two siblings, [[Credence Barebone|Credence]] and [[Modesty Barebone|Modesty]]. She was an active member of the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]], sharing her mother's zeal for the cause of eradicating [[magic]] and its [[wizardkind|practitioners]].<ref name="description">"[http://www.fantasticbeastsmovies.com/index.php/2016/10/12/full-character-descriptions/ Full Character Descriptions]" from FantasticBeastsMovies.com</ref>

Chastity died on the night of [[7 December]] 1926, having sustained fatal injuries when the Second Salem Church was destroyed by the [[Obscurus]] of Credence Barebone.

==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Barebone family.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Chasity, and her adopted family]]
At some point in time, Chastity was adopted by [[Mary Lou Barebone]]. Mary Lou was the leader of the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]], a [[No-Maj]] anti-witchcraft group. It is not known how long she was with the Barebone family. Chastity was the favourite adopted child of Mary Lou Barebone, as she had the same Anti-Witchcraft mindset as her adoptive mother and was severely loyal to her organisation the Second Salemers. Like her adopted [[Credence Barebone|brother]] and [[Modesty Barebone|sister]], Chastity was taught by her adoptive mother Mary Lou to hate [[magic]] and [[wizardkind]] at a young age.

===December 1926===

[[File:NSPS crowd.png|250px|right|thumb|The Barebone family fighting for Second Salem]]
On [[6 December]], [[1926]] while on the steps of the Steen National Bank, Chastity's adoptive mother Mary Lou held a rally to support their religious organization, [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]]. She confirmed to the public who was listening to her speech, that there are bizarre things happening through out [[New York]], that "[[Obscurus|something stalk]] our city" and "wreaking destruction." She claims to the people in public that this was the work of [[magic|witchcraft]], while Chastity and her adopted [[Credence Barebone|brother]] and [[Modesty Barebone|sister]] handed out [[Witches Live Among Us!|Anti-magic leaflets]] to the people in public.
[[File:Chastity distributing leaflets.gif|250px|thumb|left|Chastity handing out [[Anti-witchcraft leaflets|Witches Live Among Us!]] leaflefs to children for distribution]]
On the afternoon of 6 December 1926, [[Langdon Shaw]], a believer in magic, brought Chastity and his family into her father [[Henry Shaw Senior]]'s office. Mary Lou was interested in garnering the support and influence of his newspaper company and his elder son's re-election platform. But Henry Shaw refused and asked them to leave. When returning a dropped leaflet, [[Henry Shaw Junior]], the senator, called her older brother Credence a freak. Chastity left the office with her family, understanding that the Shaw family was not going to support the Second Salemers.

[[File:Fantastic-beasts-chastity.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Chastity Barebone in the [[Second Salem Church]], just before her death]]
Chastity died on the night of [[7 December]], [[1926]] as a result of fatal injuries sustained when the Second Salem Church was destroyed by Credence's [[Obscurial|Obscurus]]. The Obscurus  attacked their mother after she had tried to punish Credence after catching him with a [[Modesty Barebone's wand|toy wand]] that he had found under Modesty's bed before going out of control and tearing the church apart, accidentally killing Chastity in the process.<ref name="deathdate" />

==Physical appearance==
Chastity Barebone often appeared to be shy. She tended to blush sometimes, and to be curious. She was also often quiet and inconspicuous in public. Chastity had strawberry blonde hair and blue eyes, with light skin. 

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Chastity is more like a Mini-me version of Mary Lou, like when Mary Lou is beating Credence, she thinks "He deserves it". But another part of her is blocking it out.|Chastity Barebone's personality|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
Chastity usually followed the example of her adoptive mother, Mary Lou. She possessed a zealous anti-witchcraft mindset, much as her mother did and unlike Credence and Modesty. Chastity took her role within the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]] very seriously and would remind the children that handed out the church's leaflets to report to her if they saw any suspicious activity that could possibly register as witchcraft. She did not appear to like the punishments her mother inflicted on Credence and Modesty on occasion but also did not protest or try to stop them.

==Etymology==
Chastity is derived from the Old French ''chastete'' or the Latin ''castitatem'' (the latter the nominative of ''castitas''). First coined c. 1200, the word Chastity refers, as defined by the Church, to "sexual purity", including but not limited to celibacy or virginity.<ref>[https://www.etymonline.com/word/chastity Etymology - Chastity]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==

{{Quote|I thought Chastity was very suppressed and lonely. [But] there were little things in the script, like 'She blushed' or 'She looked curiously', so I was like, 'Oh she's a bit rebellious.' But it's all battened down.|Jenn Murray on playing Chastity|The Case of Beasts: Explore the Film Wizardry of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them}}
*Chastity is portrayed by [[Jenn Murray]] in {{FB|FA}}.<ref name="businesswire">"[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150817005158/en/Filming-Underway-%E2%80%9CFantastic-Beasts-Find-Them%E2%80%9D#.VdHvhpfMLo1 Filming Gets Underway on «Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them»]" from BusinessWire</ref>
*In the film, Chastity's fate is left unclear as she is not seen after the Obscurus destroyed the church, alive or otherwise. The screenplay, however, confirms her as having been killed.
*On ''[[Wizarding World (website)|Pottermore]]'', Chastity's character page has a red background that is usually used to represent [Gryffindor] characters.
*It is unknown if Chastity was her birth name, as she was adopted.
