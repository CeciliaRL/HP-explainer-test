'''Delfina Crimp''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who was one of the most popular dressmakers in [[London]] in the [[15th century]]. She [[Spell creation|invented]] the [[Severing Charm]] in order to make the task of cutting cloth and thread easier.<ref name="WBoS" />

==Biography==
Crimp was one of [[London]]'s most popular clothiers in the [[15th century]]. The beauty of her creations struck jealousy into the hearts of rival tailors and her dresses made even unattractive women appear lovely. Every day, her popularity grew, and with it so did her wealth.<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}}</ref>

In order to simplify the task of cutting cloth and thread, Madam Crimp [[Spell creation|invented]] the [[Severing Charm]], a neat, accurate [[charm]] that replaced older [[spell]]s that were liable to [[Fire|burn]] or shred whatever the caster was attempting to cut. However, because [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] were persecuted in the 15th century, Crimp preferred to pretend she was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]. Nonetheless, due to her phenomenal success, many of her rivals began to suspect that she was privy to a secret which they were not.<ref name="WBoS" />

A rival Muggle tailor, [[Snickerton]], donned a disguise and applied for a job in her [[Delfina Crimp's shop|shop]]. However, after several weeks, the only evidence of [[magic]] he had uncovered was the lack of scissors in her workroom. Hoping to catch her using magic, he decided to hide out in her workroom at night, wrapping himself in a bolt of velvet. He saw Crimp cutting out an intricate pattern with her [[wand]], and the next day, he brought a group of men to arrest her.<ref name="WBoS" />

Taken by surprise at her shop, Madam Crimp could offer no explanation as to why she had no scissors. Snickerton ordered her bound, fearing she might [[curse]] them, and began searching her shop for a wand. However, he turned up nothing suspicious after several hours of looking, and his friends began to doubt him.<ref name="WBoS" />

Finally, Crimp asked to be untied so that she might scratch her chin, on which she had a large [[wart]]. Seeing no risk in this request, the men agreed, but when she touched the wart, it popped out of her face to reveal her hidden [[wand]]. Quickly grabbing a bag of [[gold]], she [[Apparition|Disapparated]] from the scene, never to be seen in London again.<ref name="WBoS" />

However, from that day on, every piece of clothing Snickerton tried to make mysteriously ended up sliced to ribbons, no matter how secure it was. According to legend, he died [[Insanity|insane]], believing a giant pair of [[Invisibility|invisible]] scissors was following him wherever he went.<ref name="WBoS" /> It is likely that Madam Crimp placed a [[curse]] on him as revenge for his plot against her, or followed him around and shredded his clothes with her charm.

==Magical abilities and skills==
[[File:DiffindoCrop250.gif|thumb|250px|right|Delfina using the Severing Charm to shorten a dress]]
*'''[[Spell creation]]''': Delfina mastered the highly complex [[magic]]al art of spell creation, having successfully invented the [[Severing Charm]] in her lifetime. Given the immense difficulty and even danger involved in the invention of new [[spell]]s, her success in his field shows her to have been a very gifted and powerful [[Wizardkind|witch]] indeed.<ref name="WBoS" />
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Delfina was highly proficient with charm-work, given how she was an expert at using her custom-made [[Severing Charm]] to cut items of clothing, which helped her fashion exquisite dresses. Her dresses were also said to beautify the wearer even if they themselves were not particularly beautiful, implying that she enchanted her clothing items as well.<ref name="WBoS" />
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Being an accomplished and skilful adult witch, she was able to Apparate at will, which allowed her to escape London in a flash.<ref name="WBoS" />
*'''[[Dark Arts]] (possibly)''': It appears that Delfina was adept at [[Curse|cursing]] to the point that she was able to affect Snickerton with misfortune for the rest of his life, which ruined any garment he made.<ref name="WBoS" />
