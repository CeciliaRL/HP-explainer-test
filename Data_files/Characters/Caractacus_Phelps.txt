'''Caractacus Phelps''' (b. [[1937]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] from [[Staines]], [[Surrey]]. On [[1 April]], [[1979]], he (a forty-two year-old, at the time) exploded no less than eight-hundred [[Stink Pellets]], by dropping them en-masse from the roof of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' building in [[Diagon Alley]]. The resultant gas cloud caused untold discomfort throughout [[London]], and approximately five-hundred cases of [[Stinkitus]] were reported. The [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] authorities explained the stinking cloud away as an unpleasant emission from a nearby factory.

==Etymology==
''Caractacus'' comes from Gaelic origin, the name for a British hero who fought the Roman invaders. ''Caer'' means "a castle or city"; ''eacht'' "an exploit"; and ''cios'', "a tribute".<ref>[http://www.searchforancestors.com/surnames/origin/c/caractacus.php Search for Ancestors] Caractacus 
Alternatively, Caractacus may be the Latin form of Caradoc as in [[Caradoc Dearborn]] and Cerdic, an early form of [[Cedric Diggory]].
