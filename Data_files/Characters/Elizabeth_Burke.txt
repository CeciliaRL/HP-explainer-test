==Biography==
===Early life===
[[File:Elizabeth Burke PS film.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Elizabeth's portrait hung at the [[Grand Staircase]]]]
[[File:Elizabeth Burke.jpg|180px|thumb|Burke]]
Elizabeth attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in her youth and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]]. She was appointed [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of Hogwarts School at an unknown point.<ref name="Kinect"/> Burke had a portrait painted of herself when she was thirty-five years old.<ref name="LE">{{HPLE}}</ref>

===[[1991–1992 school year|1991–1992]] and [[1992–1993 school year]]s===
By [[1991]], Elizabeth's portrait was hung at the [[Grand Staircase]], above the stairs between the archway to the [[Entrance Hall]] and the doorway to the first-floor.<ref name="PSF">{{PS|F}}</ref>

During the next school year, Elizabeth's portrait was maintained at the same place at the Grand Staircase.<ref name="COSF">{{COS|F}}</ref>

===[[1995–1996 school year]]===

By [[1995]], her portrait was no longer hung by the first-floor landing of the [[Grand Staircase]], but two floors below, at the [[Entrance Dungeon]]. During this school year, she hid a secret passage to the [[Dungeons|Main Dungeons]]. In order to gain passage, one had to give her the password "''Slytherins are Supreme''", which only she and the [[Slytherin]] students knew about.<ref name="OP/g" /> There was another portrait of her, hung near the entrance to the [[Potions Classroom]], hiding a passage to the seventh-floor corridor. Its password was "''Facta, non verba''".<ref name="OP GBA" />

===[[1996–1997 school year]]===
By the next school year, her portraits no longer hid any secret passageway, nor did they stay on the same walls.<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

===1997===
One of her portraits was hung in [[Malfoy Manor]].<ref name="DHG1">{{DH|G1}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Elizabeth died sometime prior to [[1991]], as the portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]] depict deceased individuals. Her clothing seems to indicate that she lived during the sixteenth or seventeenth century.
*Elizabeth Burke's portrait bears a resemblance to a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Elizabeth_Talbot%2C_Countess_of_Shrewsbury_from_NPG.jpg 1592 portrait of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury] by [[Wikipedia:Rowland Lockey|Rowland Lockey]].
*It is possible she may be related to [[Caractacus Burke]], co-founder of [[Borgin and Burkes]].
*The start screen for {{HPK}} is the only time Burke's portrait is seen in the Headmaster's Office.

==Etymology==
*"Elizabeth" is from ''Ελισαβετ'' (''Elisabet''), the Greek form of the Hebrew name אֱלִישֶׁבַע (''Elisheva'') meaning "my [[God]] is an oath" or perhaps "my God is abundance". It has been very popular in England since the reign of Queen [[Elizabeth I]] in the 16th century. Famous modern bearers include the British queen [[Elizabeth II]] (1926-).
