'''Lucas Bargeworthy''' was an [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who played as a [[Beater]] for the [[English National Quidditch team]] during the late [[19th century]]. In [[August]] [[1877]], he woke up along with the rest of the [[wizarding world]] with no memory of the [[Quidditch World Cup]] that was supposed to have taken place that year, although he was mysteriously missing most of his teeth.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160307004515/https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/history-of-the-quidditch-world-cup History of the Quidditch World Cup] from {{PM}} (via The Internet Archive)</ref>
