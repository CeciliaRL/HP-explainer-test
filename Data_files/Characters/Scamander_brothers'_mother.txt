The '''mother''' of [[Newton Scamander|Newt]] and [[Theseus Scamander]] bred [[hippogriff]]s for a living and helped to inspire her son's lifelong interest in [[Creature|magical creatures]]. Despite this, her son's career in [[Magizoology]] is something with which she was "not impressed".<ref>[[Inside the Magic: The Making of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]] - Newt Scamander</ref>
