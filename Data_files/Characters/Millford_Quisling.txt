{{Quote|You stumble across Millford Quisling's long-ago discredited treatise on spell-casting in the Restricted Section of Hogwarts Library. Millford posits that a wizard can draw energy from within themselves when most in need. You apply several of his ideas and increase the maximum number of times you can cast your Inn Charm.|Description|Harry Potter: Wizards Unite}}
'''Millford Quisling''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[magical]] author and [[Magical Theory|theoretician]].<ref name="WU"/> Quisling published a treatise on the subject of [[spell]]-casting, where he posited the idea that a witch or wizard could draw energy from within themselves to augment their spellwork in a time of dire need. This treatise was ultimately discredited.<ref name="WU"/>

There was a copy of Quisling's work at the [[Restricted Section]] of [[Hogwarts Library]]. It was eventually found by a [[Calamity Investigator]] of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] that aspired to pursue a career as a [[Professor]]. Applying several of Quisling's ideas, they were successfully able to improve their use of the [[Inn Charm]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>
