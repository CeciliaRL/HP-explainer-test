{{Quote|Everyone was worried about Penelope Padgett. It wasn't because she was from Slytherin, mind you. Her parents were open supporters of You-Know-Who… Her mum's in Azkaban. There was some reason for a bit of caution.|[[Ronald Weasley]] regarding the anxiety surrounding [[Penelope Fawley]]|Harry Potter: Wizards Unite}}
'''Mrs Padgett''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[wizardkind|witch]], the wife of [[Penelope Fawley's father|Mr Padgett]] and the mother of [[Penelope Fawley|Penelope Fawley (née Padgett)]].<ref name="WU"/>

==Biography==
During the [[Second Wizarding War]], Mr and Mrs Padgett were both outspokenly supportive of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Magic is Might]] Campaign; following the war, the latter was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for involving herself in the conflict.<ref name="WU">{{WU}} (see [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-3-penelope-fawley-background this])</ref> Before she was imprisoned, the last thing she gave her daughter was a [[Comet 290]] [[broomstick]], which was regarded as the only thing she was left with to remember her by.<ref name="WU"/>

When [[Penelope Fawley|Penelope]] came to work in the [[Auror Office]], [[Gethsemane Prickle]] was suspicious of her due to her parents' ties to the [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="WU"/>
