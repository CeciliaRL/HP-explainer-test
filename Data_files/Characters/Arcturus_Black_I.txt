'''Arcturus Black''' ([[1835]] – [[1893]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. He was an early member of the [[House of Black]], and it is possible that he was the brother of [[Cygnus Black I|Cygnus]] and [[Misapinoa Black|Misapinoa]], and uncle of [[Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]] (and his siblings [[Sirius Black I|Sirius]], [[Elladora Black|Elladora]], and [[Iola Black|Iola]]).<ref>{{OOTP|F}} DVD</ref>

==Etymology==
''Arcturus'' is a name of the fourth brightest [[Wikipedia:Arcturus|star]] in the sky and the brightest star in the constellation Boötes, it is approximately 36 light-years from Earth. There were other [[House of Black|Blacks]] with the name [[Arcturus Black (disambiguation)|Arcturus]], [[Arcturus Black II]] and [[Arcturus Black III]].

==Behind the scenes==

*Based on a statement by [[Horace Slughorn]], Arcturus may have graduated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin]] house. However, he attended Hogwarts c. 1846 - 1853, when Slughorn wasn't even born.
*This character appears only on the version of the Black family tree shown in {{OOTP|FA}}. He was not included on the version of the tree which [[J. K. Rowling]] gave to a charity auction in [[2006]].<ref>"[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/blackfamilytree.html Black Family Tree]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> However, according to director [[David Yates]], Rowling provided the filmmakers with a copy of the Black family tree going back eight generations.<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20071218224958/http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/5/24/empire-magazine-feature-on-ootp 'Empire' Magazine Feature on OotP]" from The Leaky Cauldron</ref> The filmmakers presumably received a more complete version of the tree than the one auctioned off, which only goes back six generations.
*[[Cygnus Black I]] was possibly his older brother. It's possible that [[Arcturus Black II|Arcturus' great nephew]] is named after him.
