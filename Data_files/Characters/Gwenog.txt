'''Gwenog''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived near [[Queerditch Marsh]] during the [[11th century]]. She was friends with [[Gertie Keddle]], and often played the game that would become [[Quidditch]].<ref>{{QTA|R|3}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In 2017, in response to a [[Wikipedia:Twitter|tweet]] from the [[Wikipedia:QI|QI Elves]] saying that "''Quidditch, digestive biscuits and overdrafts were all invented in Edinburgh''", [[J. K. Rowling]] remarked that Quidditch was in actuality invented in [[Manchester]].<ref name="jkr-manchester">[[J. K. Rowling]] on Twitter: [https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/834073293770616832 "Untrue, I'm afraid! Quidditch was invented in Manchester."]</ref> This is not a reference to the location of Queerditch Marsh, however, but the actual place in which Rowling came up with the idea of Quidditch — in a hand-signed, annotated first edition of {{PS}} that was auctioned for charity in 2013, Rowling remarked that she had invented Quidditch while staying in a small hotel in Manchester after a row with her then-boyfriend, adding rules that she was sure would infuriate men, which she found satisfying given her state of mind at the time.<ref>Furness, Hannah (18 May 2013).
