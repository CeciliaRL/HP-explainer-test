==Etymology==
The name "Winston" is from a surname derived from an English place name, which was in turn derived from the Old English given name Wynnstan meaning "joy stone". A famous bearer was Winston Churchill (1874-1965), the British [[Prime Minister]] during World War II. This name was also borne by the fictional Winston Smith, the protagonist in [[George Orwell]]'s 1949 novel ''1984''.
