'''Felix Rosier''' (born c. 1969) was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1980]] and was Sorted into [[Slytherin]].

==Biography==

===Early life {{C|1968/69-1980}}===
Felix was born in the late [[1960s]]. His father may have been a top [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] killed or imprisoned during the [[First Wizarding War]].<ref name="Death Eater father">{{HM|3|3}}</ref>

===Hogwarts years {{C|1980-1987}}===
Felix started his education in [[1980]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin]]. He cared about the [[House Cup]] and having Slytherin in the lead. Sometimes this meant breaking the rules, such as using the [[Freezing Charm]] on [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]'s opponents to help Slytherin win the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]].<ref name="Y3PrefectSQ" />

In his [[fifth year]], Felix became the Slytherin male [[Prefect]].

===After Hogwarts {{C|1987-}}===
Felix later went on to become a [[dragonologist]] after graduating from Hogwarts and specialised in [[Peruvian Vipertooth]]s.

At some point, Bill Weasley had contacted Felix and the other prefects for a get-together at the [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]] pub in Hogsmeade.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Felix was knowledgeable and skilled in the field of [[Magizoology]], the study of [[magic]]al [[creature]]s. After graduating from Hogwarts, Felix became a [[Dragonologist]] and specialised in [[Peruvian Vipertooth]]s.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Felix possessed a degree of talent in charm-work, being able to successfully use the [[Freezing Charm]] to immobilise [[Quidditch]] opponents of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] surreptitiously.<ref name="Y3PrefectSQ" /> He was also skilled with the [[Knockback Jinx]].<ref name="HM2SQ">{{HM|2|Slytherin Schemes}}</ref>
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Felix was proficient in potion-making, as he was capable of successfully brewing [[Babbling Beverage]].<ref name="Y3PrefectSQ"/> 
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Felix was highly capable of handling [[magic]]al plants, such as [[Snargaluff]].<ref name="Y3PrefectSQ"/> 

==Possessions==
*'''[[Wand]]''': Felix likely purchased his wand at the age of eleven before attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

==Behind the scenes==
*When [[Jacob's sibling]] is serving at the [[Three Broomsticks Inn|Three Broomsticks]] in {{HM}}, one of the customers can say "I heard Rosier's father was a top Death Eater."<ref name="Death Eater father" /> It is possible that [[Rosier (male)|Rosier]] is his father and [[Evan Rosier]] is his older brother.
*In {{HM}}, if [[Jacob's sibling]] was sorted into [[Slytherin]], Felix would be revealed to be adept at [[Charm]]s, [[Potion]]s, and [[Herbology]], teaching Jacob's sibling the [[Freezing Charm]], how to brew the [[Babbling Beverage]], and about [[Snargaluff]] respectively when before he graduated from Hogwarts.<ref name="Y3PrefectSQ" />
