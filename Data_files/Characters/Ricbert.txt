==Behind the scenes==
*This goblin is not named in {{DH|F2}}, however, the original screenplay had [[Bogrod]] referring to him as "Ricbert".<ref name="script"/>
*[[Rusty Goffe]] portrays Ricbert in {{DH|F2}}.<ref name="rustygoffe">[http://www.rustygoffe.co.uk/ "The Rusty Goffe page"]</ref>
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|second part of the film adaptation]] of {{DH}}, this goblin is the one who [[Hermione Granger]] (disguised as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]) and [[Ronald Weasley]] (disguised as "Dragomir Despard") address.
