'''Elizabeth II''' (full name '''Elizabeth Alexandra Mary'''; born [[21 April]] [[1926]]) was the reigning [[queen]] of the [[Great Britain|United Kingdom]] and other [[wikipedia:Commonwealth|Commonwealth]] countries during the [[1990s]]. She was still queen as of [[{{CURRENTYEAR}}]] and became the longest serving monarch of Britain in [[September]] [[2015]].<ref>"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II Elizabeth II]" on Wikipedia</ref>

==Corgi incident==
In September [[1991]], one of the Queen's [[corgi|corgwn]] was [[Corgi to hamster spell|transformed]] into a [[hamster]] by an unknown [[wizardkind|witch or wizard]], prompting the [[Improper Use of Magic Office]] to launch an investigation and question several suspects.<ref name="ps-prophet">{{PS|F}} {{see image|File:GringottsBreakInProphetLarge.jpg}}</ref> The motive behind this attack was unknown at the time,<ref name="ps-prophet" /> and it is not known if the culprit was ever found.

[[Non-magic people|Muggle]] authorities, on the other hand, concluded that the Queen's corgi had been stolen and replaced with a hamster as a "cruel" prank.<ref name="ps-prophet" /> They launched a "full scale" search to attempt to locate the [[dog]].<ref name="ps-prophet" />

The incident was reported in the [[6 September]] 1991 issue of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''.<ref name="ps-prophet" />

The Queen's likeness was featured on the obverse face of [[Great Britain|British]] [[Muggle money|banknotes]].<ref name="banknotewiki">"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banknotes_of_the_pound_sterling Banknotes of the pound sterling]" on Wikipedia</ref> A £50 note was among several objects left on a table at the [[Siren's Rest]] pub in [[Wales]].<ref name="cob4">{{FBC|4}}</ref>

The Queen's [[wikipedia:royal cypher|royal cypher]] appeared on streetlamps along the [[Victoria Embankment]] in [[London]].<ref name="WWHP">{{WWHP}} {{See image|File:EIIR.png}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{QH}}, Queen Elizabeth II lost her handbag and the [[Prime Minister]] sent the task of finding it to [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Neville Longbottom]]. The events surrounding this short skit cannot, however, be considered canon, as it contradicts canon in several points.
*It is unknown if, as Queen of the United Kingdom in the second half of the [[20th century]], Elizabeth II was ever made aware of the existence of the [[wizarding world]] or the wizarding goings-on like the [[First Wizarding War|First]] or [[Second Wizarding War]], like her [[Prime Minister]] was. If [[Victoria|Queen Victoria]] is any indication,<ref name="pm-ministers">{{PM|ministers-for-magic}}</ref> then Queen Elizabeth probably remains ignorant of the wizarding world.

==Etymology==
The name "[[Elizabeth (disambiguation)|Elizabeth]]" comes from Ελισαβετ (''Elisabet''), the [[Greece|Greek]] form of the Hebrew name אֱלִישֶׁבַע (''Elisheva'') meaning "my [[God]] is an [[Unbreakable Vow|oath]]" or perhaps "my God is abundance".
