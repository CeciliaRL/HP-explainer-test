This '''individual''' (fl. [[1862]]) was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who was, in his lifetime, a young [[Quidditch]] player<ref name="mtv">[http://www.mtv.ca/moviehead/article.jhtml?id=25349 We Take You Inside The Wizarding World Of Harry Potter] on [http://www.mtv.ca/moviehead/ MTV.ca]</ref> He had a portrait of himself hung in [[Gryffindor Tower]] by the [[1990s]].<ref>See [http://www.flickr.com/photos/32005256@N03/4820782603/in/photostream/ this image]</ref>

He seems to have been an adventurer in his youth: he claims to have taken [[enchanted bench]]es on test flights "and lived to tell the tale", to have flown a [[Chinese Fireball]] from the [[South Pole]] to the [[North Pole]] ("''my shoes didn't arrive until the next day''"), to have scored the winning goal in the 1862 [[League Cup|League Championship]] wearing nothing but a smile ("''The other side jinxed off all our robes''"), to have raced a dragon with a firework tied to its tail on an [[enchanted bench]] ("''In fact, the last time I raced one, it caught fire''"), and to have taken a party of ladies for a spin over the [[Himalayas]] on [[enchanted bench]] ("''If I knew where they landed, I would've brought them back, too''").<ref name="Parkpedia">[http://parkpedia.cc/harry-potter-and-the-forbidden-journey/ "Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey"] at [http://parkpedia.cc/ Parkpedia]</ref>
