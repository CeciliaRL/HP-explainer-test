'''Hector Podmore''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] who worked as a [[Minister]] in the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="FBS"/>

==Biography==
On [[6 December]] [[1926]], he attended an emergency meeting of the [[International Confederation of Wizards]] to discuss the [[magic]]al disturbances happening in [[New York]]. He questioned [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] about his reasons for being in New York and was sceptical of the reply that he was there to buy an [[Appaloosa Puffskein]].<ref name="FBS">{{FB|S}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Hector Podmore was portrayed by [[Richard Clothier]] in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'', but was credited only as "British Envoy".<ref>[http://www.unitedagents.co.uk/richard-clothier United Agents - Richard Clothier]</ref><ref>{{IMDb name|nm0167134|Richard Clothier}}</ref>
*Interestingly, the Minister for Magic during the time period was [[Hector Fawley]]; it is possible he was intented to be this character but there having been a mix-up with the names. He could also have have been just a senior Ministry official, as the title of [[Minister]] has been used elsewhere in canon to refer to high-ranking individuals within the Ministry's Departments.
*Alternatively, the title of Minister might, in this case, indicate that Hector Podmore was a diplomat. In the real world, a Minister (in full, "[[Wikipedia:Envoy (title)|Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary]]", also referred simply as "envoy") was a diplomatic head of mission of the second class (ranked below Ambassador); the position was commonplace in the time period {{FB|F}} is set, but became obsolete after the Second World War as most countries upgraded their [[Wikipedia:Diplomatic rank|diplomatic rank]] to ambassadorial.
