'''Laura''' was an individual mentioned in [[shrieking book|a book]] kept in the [[Restricted Section]] of the [[Hogwarts Library]] by the [[1990s]].<ref name="PSf22">{{PS|F}} - Chapter 22 (''Cloaked in Darkness'')</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{PS|FA}}, the [[shrieking book]] appears to be a copy of ''[http://books.google.ca/books?id=tSs3AAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false The Works of the Most Reverend Dr John Tillotson]''. As an Easter Egg, it seems someone in the special effects department digitally replaced some of the book's original text with names: "''Laura and [[Chas]]''" (left page, bottom paragraph), "''[[Terry Chloe|Terry Michelle Chloe]] and [[Aimee]]''" (middle right page), "''[[Debbie Amy]] and [[Leon]]''" (right page, bottom paragraph).
