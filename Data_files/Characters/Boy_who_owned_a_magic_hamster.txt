This '''individual''' (born c. [[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]].<ref name="PSgba">{{PS|G}} - GBA version</ref>

==Biography==
{{Quote|Saving on the light bill by using Lumos helped mum and dad save enough Galleons to send me here.|Shortly before [[Quirinus Quirrell]]'s [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] lesson concerning the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]].|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}This boy was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]], in c. [[1980]]. He was the son of a [[wizardkind|witch and a wizard]] who, apparently, had limited means and were integrated in [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] society — he would note, in his [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] years, that his mum and dad saved money on the [[electricity|light bill]] by using the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]] instead.<ref name="PSgba"/>

He started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1991-1992 school year]], and was [[sorting ceremony|sorted]] to [[Slytherin]].<ref name="PSgba"/>

{{Quote|I wish I knew what dittany looks like. Goyle told me it looks like a yeti.|The boy.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
Before the [[first year|first-years']] first [[Potions (class)|Potions]] class, he expressed his excitement and his love for fizzy things ("''Will we be making fizzy [[potion]]s today? I love fizzy things.''"), but afterwards did not seem to have enjoyed [[Severus Snape]]'s lecture. He stood in the [[Dungeons]] and commented to his friends that "''I had a bad day in potions class. Is my hair on fire?''". He did not complete Snape's assignment of gathering all the ingredients for the [[Wiggenweld Potion]] (only [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] managed to procure [[Wiggentree bark]]) — at one point, he asked around what [[dittany]] looked like, as [[Gregory Goyle]] had told him it looked like a [[yeti]].<ref name="PSgba"/>

Shortly before the [[Hallowe'en feast]], he stood by [[Boy who failed Avifors Spell's cousin|a Slytherin girl]] in the [[Entrance Hall]], as he had apparently misplaced his [[magic hamster]].<ref name="PSgba"/>

{{Quote|Is transforming something into a bat or really big moth close enough to pass the Avifors test?|The boy.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
Shortly before [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] class, he paced by the [[First-floor corridor]], and nervously asked [[Harry Potter]] if turning something into a [[bat]] or a large [[moth]] would be sufficient to pass the [[Avifors Spell|Avifors]] test. This suggests that he was not particularly accomplished in the subject.<ref name="PSgba"/> He made fun of [[Quirinus Quirrell]], by saying "''I don't know what's wrapped tighter, Quirrell's nerves or [[Quirinus Quirrell's turban|his turban]]''".<ref name="PSgba"/>
{{Quote|You'll only make things harder on yourself that way, Potter.|This student is hit by a spell.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
At some point in the school year, he heard something sniffing around behind the door to the [[Third-floor corridor|Forbidden Corridor]] and ran all the way back to [[Slytherin Dungeon|his common room]].<ref name="PSgba"/> On another occasion, he and [[Vincent Crabbe]] snuck to the [[Astronomy classroom|observatory]] up on the [[Astronomy Tower]] and spent the night eating [[Pumpkin Pasty|Pumpkin Pasties]].<ref name="PSgba"/>

{{Quote|Crabbe and I snuck into the observatory on the seventh floor and ate pumpkin pasties all night long!|The boy.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}

Throghout the school year, he was confident that [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] would win the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]], and offered to clear the mantle in the common room to give the Cup a place of honour (although, according to him, it needed dusting, anyway).<ref name="PSgba"/> He attended breakfast in the [[Great Hall]] on the day of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team|Gryffindor]] vs. [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team|Ravenclaw]] [[Quidditch]] match, where he asked if anyone knew any good [[Cribbing Spell]]s.<ref name="PSgba"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*This student is clearly a [[first year|first-year]] from his dialogue and presence in first-year classes. In spite of this fact, there are multiple [[Prefect]]s during night-time sneak missions that bear his likeness.
*By bringing a hamster, the student broke school rules, as students are only allowed to bring a [[cat]] or a [[toad]] or an [[owl]] as pets.
*[[J. K. Rowling]] revealed on Twitter that there is no tuition fee at Hogwarts, and that the [[British Ministry of Magic]] covers all costs. It's unknown why his parents had to save money to send him to Hogwarts. It is possible that he referred to the costs of books and other equipment, though second hand books are available at Hogwarts.
