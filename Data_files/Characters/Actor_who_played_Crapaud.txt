{{Quote|Take one ill-fated performance of Malecrit's classic wizarding play 'Alas, I have Transfigured my Feet'. History does not record the names of the actors, which is perhaps for the best since by halfway throught the first act the audience had taken to throwing pumpkins.|[[Miranda Goshawk]], ''[[Book of Spells]]''.|Wonderbook: Book of Spells}}
This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and actor who played the part of [[Crapaud]] in a disastrous performance of [[Malecrit]]'s classic wizarding play ''[[Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré Les Pieds]]''.

==Biography==
The names of the actors of this particular performance were not recorded and, as such, are unknown to history.<ref name="Wonderbook">{{WBS}} - Chapter 2, Part 1</ref>

This individual's performance, alongside the performance of the [[Actor who played Grenouille|wizard]] who played [[Grenouille]], was not particularly appealing and, as such, the bored audience spent much of act one throwing pumpkins at them.<ref name="Wonderbook"/>

During the eponymous foot-transfiguration scene, the [[special effects wizard]] tried to liven up the play by conjuring a [[Fire-Making Spell|stream of flames]] instead of the puff of yellow smoke he was supposed to conjure. The curtains caught alight and soon enough the whole theatre was ablaze. The actor playing Crapaud took this as his moment to shine and, protected by a [[Flame-Freezing Charm]], delivered the play's final rousing speech in the flame-engulfed stage, as the rest of the cast and the audience fled in panic, and the [[special effects wizard]] vainly trying to put out the fire while dodging [[hex]]es from the play's director.<ref name="Wonderbook"/>
