'''Cygnus Black''' ([[1880s|1889]] – [[1943]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the fourth son and youngest child of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] and [[Ursula Flint]], the youngest brother of [[Sirius Black II|Sirius]], [[Phineas Black|Phineas]], [[Arcturus Black II|Arcturus]] and [[Belvina Black|Belvina]], the husband of [[Violetta Bulstrode|Violetta Black]] (née Bulstrode) and the father of [[Pollux Black|Pollux]], [[Cassiopeia Black|Cassiopeia]], [[Marius Black|Marius]], and [[Dorea Black|Dorea]]. He is a member of [[House of Black]].

==Etymology==
Like many other members of the [[House of Black]], Cygnus is named after a [[Wikipedia:Cygnus (constellation)|constellation]]. Cygnus is a northern constellation also known as the Swan or the Northern Cross. It was named for several swans which appear in Greek mythology, including the one Zeus transformed into to seduce Leda, the form Orpheus took after his death, and a [[Wikipedia:Cycnus|son]] of the god Apollo who was turned into a swan after his murder. The name is derived from the Greek κύκνος, ''kyknos'', meaning "swan".

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on a statement by [[Horace Slughorn]], Cygnus may have been a member of the [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. However, he attended Hogwarts c. [[1900]] - [[1907]], when Slughorn wasn't Potions teacher.
*On the film version of the [[House of Black|Black family tree]], there was no picture of Cygnus, only his and his wife's names. This is corrected on the family tree visible on the DVD2 of {{OOTP|FA}}.
*Cygnus was possibly named after [[Cygnus Black I]], an early member of the [[House of Black]], who was his possible grandfather. [[Cygnus Black III|His grandson]] was also named Cygnus.
*It is worth noting that [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] (Cygnus's father) was forty-two years old when he had Cygnus. Most House of Black members have their children at considerably young ages, e.g. [[Pollux Black]] was thirteen when he had his [[Walburga Black|daughter]]. It is likely that both of these issues are mathematical errors by [[J. K. Rowling]], for there are many errors in the family tree and Rowling has also admitted that "math is not her strong suit."
*Both Cygnus and his grandson [[Alphard Black|Alphard]] have the exact same face in the [[Black Family Tapestry|tapestry]], only mirrored.
*The [https://www.pottermore.com/features/black-family-tree%7C Black Family Tree] article for Orion claims that his grandfather is brother of Cygnus, who is said to be Walburga's ''uncle''; J.K. Rowling's hand written tree, however, reveals that Cygnus is her ''grandfather.''
*Before the reveal that [[Fleamont Potter|Fleamont]] and [[Euphemia Potter]] were the parents of [[James Potter I|James]], it was speculated that Cygnus' daughter [[Dorea Black|Dorea]] and her husband [[Charlus Potter|Charlus]] were his parents and thus the grandparents of [[Harry Potter]]. Therefore, Cygnus was the presumed grandfather and great-grandfather of James and Harry, respectively.
