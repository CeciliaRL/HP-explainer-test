}}'''Parkin''' (fl. [[1422]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Wizardkind|witch or wizard]] who played as a [[Chaser]] for the original [[Wigtown Wanderers]] team during the [[15th century]] and was a child of Wanderers founder [[Walter Parkin]]. 

The Wanderers were a formidable team during this time who won most of their matches, perhaps partly because Walter himself used to attend every game holding his wand in one hand and a meat cleaver in the other.<ref>{{QTA|R|7}}</ref> The original Chasers invented their own signature move, known as the [[Parkin's Pincer]], where three Chasers fly from different directions at an opposing Chaser.<ref>{{QTA|R|10}}</ref>
