'''Mary Doyle''' was a [[Gryffindor]]<ref name="house" /> [[Wizardkind|student]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1990]] or [[1991]].<ref name="age" />

==Biography==
She competed in the school [[Wizard Skittles]] tournament during the [[1996–1997 school year]].

==Etymology==
The name "Mary" is the English form of ''Maria'', which was the Latin form of the New Testament Greek names Μαριαμ (''Mariam'') and Μαρια (''Maria'') - the spellings are interchangeable - which were from the Hebrew name מִרְיָם (''Miryam''). The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including "sea of bitterness", "rebelliousness", and "wished for child". However it was most likely originally an Egyptian name, perhaps derived in part from ''mry'' "beloved" or mr "love".
