'''Charles Demengeot''' was a [[19th century]] French heraldic engraver and typographer, who published ''[[Dictionnaire du Chiffre-monogramme dans les Styles Moyen-age et Renaissance et couronnes nobilaires universelles]]'' [[1881]], a work that famously includes a monogram of the entire alphabet.<ref name="CSf">{{COS|F}}</ref><ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86265651/f11.image Frontispiece of "Dictionnaire du Chiffre-monogramme dans les Styles Moyen-age et Renaissance et couronnes nobilaires universelles"] at [http://gallica.bnf.fr/?lang=EN Gallica - Bibliothèque Numérique (Bibliothèque nationale de France)]</ref>

By [[1992]], there was an aged poster featuring the frontispiece of his work, posted on the walls on [[Knockturn Alley]].<ref name="CSf"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Demengeot's work seems to have influenced the graphical typefaces in some of the logos and monograms featured in some of the props in the [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' films]]. Good examples of this are, for instance, the [[:File:Beauxbatons Crest.jpg|Beauxbatons crest]], which seems to have been inspired in [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86265651/f247.image this monogram (top)], and the [[:File:Advocates to the Wizarding World.jpg|logo of Advocates to the Wizarding World]], which seems to have been based on [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86265651/f291.image this one (third one from the top, on the right)].
