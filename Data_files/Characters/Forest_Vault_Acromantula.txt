==Biography==
===1987–1988 school year===
In the [[1987–1988 school year]], he stayed near the entrance of the [[Forest Vault]], as he could easily prey on the [[Sleepwalking curse|sleepwalking]] students approaching him and devour their [[flesh]]. Thankfully, the [[centaur]] [[Torvus]] sent the students back to the castle before the foul [[beast]] could get a chance to devour a student. [[Jacob's sibling]], when they ventured into the forest to find out the truth surrounding the vault, came across the Acromantula, and attacked him with [[magic]], before finally defeating him with ''[[Arania Exumai]]'', stunning him and sending him fleeing back to his colony.<ref name="HM416">{{HM|4|16}}</ref>

After the Forest Vault had been broken into, the Acromantula went rogue and barged into the [[Red Cap's Hole]], forcing the [[Red Cap in the Forbidden Forest|Red Cap]] that lived there to leave. The Acromantula stuck [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] to the ground with his web, but was confronted by Jacob's sibling, who [[Skirmish in the Red Cap's Hole|fought]] him again. He was then convinced to return back to the colony. When he reunited with the other Acromantulas, they decided to eat the students after all and [[Attack in the Spider's Lair|attacked]] them, and before they lost control, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] came holding [[Rubeus Hagrid's crossbow|his crossbow]], which drove the Acromantulas away.<ref name="TTF">{{HM|4|TORVUS AND THE TROUBLED FOREST}}</ref>

===1988–1989 school year===
At the start of the [[1988–1989 school year]], [[Jacob's sibling]] and another student returned to the [[Spider's Lair]] and fought the Acromantula in order to find [[Beatrice Haywood]].<ref name="HM52">{{HM|5|2}}</ref>

Later during this school year, Jacob's sibling and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] returned to face an Acromantula to get some of its [[Acromantula venom|venom]] to give [[Mundungus Fletcher]] in order to get more information about the [[Marauder's Map]] from him. It is likely that this was the Acromantula they fought.<ref name="HM511">{{HM|5|11}}</ref>

===1989–1990 school year===
It was possibly this Acromantula that [[Ben Copper]] would often taunt and attack during the [[1989–1990 school year]] to become braver.<ref name="HM613">{{HM|6|13}}</ref>
