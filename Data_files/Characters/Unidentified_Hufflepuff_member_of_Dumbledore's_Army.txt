This '''Hufflepuff girl''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]]. She was also a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in [[1995]] and has a [[Unidentified Gryffindor member of Dumbledore's Army|twin sister]] who was Sorted into [[Gryffindor]].<ref name="OOTPF"/>

==Biography==
===Hogwarts years===
{{Quote|Every great [[Wizardkind|wizard]] in history has started out as nothing more than what we are now: students. If they can do it, why not us?|[[Harry Potter]] inspiring the members of Dumbledore's Army|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)}}
She started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] at some point before [[1994]], and was Sorted into [[Hufflepuff]]. Her [[Unidentified Gryffindor member of Dumbledore's Army|twin sister]], however, was Sorted into [[Gryffindor]].

In [[1994]], Hogwarts held the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. She supported [[Cedric Diggory]] in the Tournament and initially wore a [[Potter Stinks badge]]. She attended [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] classes with students from the other houses this year and was taught by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Professor Alastor Moody]], who demonstrated the three [[Unforgivable Curses]] in front of the class. At the end of the year, [[Cedric Diggory]], a fellow Hufflepuff, was murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and Hogwarts held a [[Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory]].<ref name="GOFF">{{GOF|F}}</ref>

In [[1995]], her fifth year, [[Dolores Umbridge]] was appointed as [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]] and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, so that the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] could keep watch on [[Albus Dumbledore]] after he and [[Harry Potter]] claimed that [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned. Umbridge refused to teach students any form of practical defence, and, given the circumstances, [[Hermione Granger]] felt that the student body needed a teacher who would, so then an alliance called [[Dumbledore's Army]] was formed. The Hufflepuff girl joined the D.A. and practised at several meetings, learning spells such as the [[Impediment Jinx]], [[Disarming Charm]] and the [[Patronus Charm]]. During one lesson, Harry was giving a speech and whilst doing so he was checking on students. He checked on this student and raised her arm to give her better aim, and after doing so she managed to perform a [[Nonverbal spell|nonverbal]] version of the [[Stunning Spell]], to which she looked pleased and slightly embarrassed for Harry touching her. This was quite advanced [[magic]] as other students were finding it difficult to perform disarming spells verbally.<ref name="OOTPF">{{OOTP|F}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*She is portrayed by actress [[Siobhan Ellen Williams]] in the films ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''. This actress also plays a [[Unidentified Gryffindor member of Dumbledore's Army|Gryffindor student]] in the same film.
*As she is a notable character in {{OOTP|FA}} she may be [[Alice Tolipan]] (a named students on the Dumbledore's Army parchment that don't appear in the books).
*She may also be [[Megan Jones]].
*Another possible identity could be [[Susan Bones]].
*In the DS version of {{LEGO|Y2}}, she is referred to as "[[Hufflepuff]] [[Prefect]]". This is not canon, as [[Hannah Abbott]] was the female prefect for Hufflepuff in Harry Potter's year.
