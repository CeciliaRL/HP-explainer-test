The '''Captain''' of the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters]] was a character in popular wizarding tale ''[[Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump]]'', by [[Beedle the Bard]].

==History==
{{Quote| ''[The King]'' commanded the head of his army to form a Brigade of Witch-Hunters, and issued them with a pack of ferocious black hounds|[[Beedle the Bard]], ''[[Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump]]''.|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
According to the tale, the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters]] was created a long time ago by a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[King (Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump)|King]] of a very far away land who wanted to keep all the magic in the world for himself. In order to do so, he needed to gather all the [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] in the world, so he formed the Brigade and ordered this man its captain.<ref name="Babbitty Rabbitty">{{TBB|R}} - Chapter 4 (''Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump'')</ref>

Later in the tale, the Captain requested the King to bring [[Sabre]], a hound from the Brigade, back to life with his "wand" (actually a twig with no magical powers whatsoever sold to him by a [[Charlatan]]). When the King's court mocked him for having no magical powers, he ordered the charlatan to be killed, however, the charlatan told him that [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]], a witch and the King's washerwoman, was blocking his spells. When Babbitty denounced the charlatan for the fraud he was, she proposed the Captain to cut him in half, a deed the Captain was eager to do.<ref name="Babbitty Rabbitty"/>
