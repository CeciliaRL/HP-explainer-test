}}'''Thornton Harkaway''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] and the [[President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America]].<ref name="PM"/>

==Biography==
He opted to have the headquarters for the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]] moved to his hometown of [[Williamsburg]], [[Virginia]] in [[1760]]. He was described as flamboyant. He bred [[Crup]]s and unfortunately his pack savagely attacked several [[Muggle|No-Majs]], who afterwards were only able to bark for a period of 48 hours. This breach of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|Statute of Secrecy]] led to him leaving office in disgrace.<ref name="PM"/>

It may not be a coincidence that [[Public Hospital for Persons of Insane and Disordered Minds|the first dedicated psychiatric hospital]] was established in Williamsburg as odd sightings the Harkaway residence might account for many No-Majs who were admitted, but who were actually sane.<ref name="PM"/>
