==Biography==
[[File:London Five Missing.png|150px|thumb|left|The ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' reports the disappearance of Riya Patel, among others]]
They were one of the [[Auror]]s who mysteriously vanished during the [[London Five]] sometime during the mid-to-late [[2010s]]. Their disappearance occurred within a few hours of the other four Aurors. It was the first instance of people having gone mysteriously missing since the [[Second Wizarding War]], and hence came as a great shock to the [[Wizardkind|wizarding community]] of [[Great Britain]] at large. An investigation was launched by the [[British Ministry of Magic]] to try and locate Patel and their fellow victims. As time passed, however, the Ministry met a dead end when the trail went cold, and it was generally felt by many that the chance of finding Patel grew increasingly smaller, causing the despair of their [[Patel family|family]] to increase and turn into outrage when the case was closed. As [[Gareth Greengrass]] indeed speculated, it is very likely that Patel was deceased, as of [[2018]], though there was a small chance they were still alive.<ref name="WU trailer img">{{WU}} {{See image|file:WU trailer documents ref.png}}</ref>
