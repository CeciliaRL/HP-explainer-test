'''Winky Crockett''' (also spelled '''Crocket''') was a [[Wizardkind|wizard or witch]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]], and was a member of [[Gryffindor]] house.<ref name="library">See [[:File:LibraryBooksToBeReturned.png|this image]] and [[:File:LibraryBooksToBeReturned2.jpg|this image]] of a prop used in the films on display as part of {{HPE}}.</ref><ref name="gobstones">See [[:File:GobstonesClubSignUpSheet.jpg|this image]] of a prop used in the films on display as part of {{HPE}}.</ref>

Winky's name was included on a list of students with overdue [[Hogwarts Library|library]] books that was put up on the [[Gryffindor Notice Board|bulletin board]] in the [[Gryffindor Tower|Gryffindor common room]] by [[Irma Pince|Madam Pince]] sometime in the 1990s.<ref name="library"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*This character is mentioned only on two prop notices that have been featured in at least one [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' film]].<ref name="library" /><ref name="gobstones" /> On the [[:File:LibraryBooksToBeReturned.png|first notice]], their name was spelled "Winky Crocket," and on the [[:File:GobstonesClubSignUpSheet.jpg|the second]], it was was spelled "Winky Crockett." However, since both instances of the name are from the same house and time frame, they can be assumed to refer to the same person, with one presumably being a misspelling.
*The name of this character is a tribute to Jordan Crockett, who worked as an art department production assistant on the first two [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' films]], and as a draughtsman on ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''.<ref>"[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0188412/ Jordan Crockett]" on IMDb</ref>
*The first name 'Winky' is most likely a nod to the character from the books. She was a [[House-Elf]] that was cut from the films.
