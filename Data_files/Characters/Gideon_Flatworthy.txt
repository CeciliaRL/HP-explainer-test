{{Quote|Their leader was a wizard called Gideon Flatworthy, whom the Daily Prophet famously called ‘less a wizard, more a lazy walrus-like object who lies all day on a rather smelly cushion, and expects people to admire him for it’.|[[Miranda Goshawk]] introduces Flatworthy in her wizarding play on the [[Summoning Charm]] in ''[[Book of Spells]]''.|Wonderbook: Book of Spells}}
'''Gideon Flatworthy''' (d. [[18 September]], [[1743]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and an anti-[[Non-magic people|Muggle]] extremist. He led the anti-Muggle organisation, the [[Accionites]].<ref name="WB"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Little is known of his early life. He was born in [[Europe]], as it is known that he had an account in [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] but did not use it as he was too lazy.<ref name="WB"/>

===Later life===
After learning the [[magic]]al arts, he formed the [[Accionites]], a gang of anti-muggle activists who mostly just sat around and did nothing. When they ran out of [[gold]], instead of going to [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] to get more he instead summoned several valuable [[goblin]]-made artefacts. The [[goblin]]s who had created them came to the [[Accionites]]' headquarters, brandishing swords angrily and "baying for the Accionites' blood".<ref name="WB"/>

===Death and post-mortem===
After disapparating twice to avoid the goblins and being abandoned by his gang, he tried to [[Summoning Charm|summon]] a farm, some livestock, and a well-stocked larder. He was crushed to death by the bales of hay and cattle that landed on top of him. Experts are uncertain why he did this (they still debate about it) although the most common theory is that he became delirious from lack of food.<ref name="WB"/> Sometime after he died, [[Miranda Goshawk]] published his story in her ''[[Book of Spells]]'', in a wizarding play about the [[Summoning Charm]].<ref name="WB"/>

==Physical appearance==
He was extremely overweight from having lain on a pile of cushions most of his adult life, and wore a golden crown with blue robes. Flatworthy also had an extremely thin moustache.<ref name="WB"/>

==Personality and traits==
Gideon was a [[Wizarding supremacy|wizarding supremacist]], having formed the [[Accionites]] group to prove wizarding superiority. However, he was very lazy, and his act of despising muggles was solely believing that being able to lift and carry objects magically was what made him and his group superior to them. His laziness was exemplified by his constant usage of the Summoning Charm to bring objects to him, to the point of taking gold and treasures from [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] rather than withdrawing some from his own vault. He was arrogant, believing that sitting on a smelly cushion and did nothing but summoning objects to him was something for his peers to admire.<ref name="WB"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Flatworthy disapparated at least twice in his life, with great success, whilst being attacked by a horde of angry [[goblin]]s.<ref name="WB"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Flatworthy was an expert at performing the [[Summoning Charm]], having used it successfully at multiple times in his life (this was because he believed himself to be above lifting and carrying things non-[[magic]]ally). This came at the cost of his life eventually, as when he tried to lift cattle and hay with the charm, he was crushed and killed by it all when it fell upon him.<ref name="WB"/>
