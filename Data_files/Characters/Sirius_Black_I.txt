'''Sirius Black I''' ([[1845]] – [[1853]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], possibly the eldest son of [[Cygnus Black I|Cygnus Black]] and [[Ella Max]], and the elder brother of [[Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]], [[Elladora Black|Elladora]] and [[Iola Black|Iola]]. Sirius died when he was only eight years old, for unknown reasons.<ref name="BFT" />

==Etymology==
Sirius is a name of the brightest star in the night sky. In the [[House of Black|Black family]] there were also [[Sirius Black II]] (a nephew of Sirius I, son of Phineas Nigellus) and [[Sirius Black|Sirius III]], [[Walburga Black|Walburga]]'s and [[Orion Black|Orion's]] son. If Cygnus was his father, [[Arcturus Black I]] was his uncle.

==Behind the scenes==
*The reason why Sirius died so young, aged 7 or 8, is currently unknown. However, it is interesting to note that he died during the [[Wikipedia:Third cholera pandemic (1852–60)|third cholera pandemic (1852–60)]] that claimed 23,000 lives in Great Britain, 10,000 lives in [[London]] alone. Even though [[J. K. Rowling]] has said that "''a wizard could catch anything a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] might catch, but he could cure all of it''",<ref>{{WW|illness-and-disability}}</ref> it could be the case that Sirius had not yet manifested his magical powers at the time due to his young age ([[seven]] is the age by which most experts believe that [[magic]] will reveal itself in a wizard or witch<ref>{{DH|B|11}}</ref>). This, however, would not explain why an adult wizard failed to heal him, though it's possible Rowling's comment referred to the workings of a wizard's magical innate immune system and not to the existence of a wizarding cure for every non-magical malady.
*Sirius was maybe a son of [[Cygnus Black I]] and his wife Ella Max, but if this is true, that means Cygnus was 16 years old when he had Sirius. This is possibly a mathematical mistake. If Cygnus was his father, [[Arcturus Black I]] was his uncle. His aunt may have been [[Misapinoa Black|Misapinoa Blishwick (née Black)]].
