'''Ethelbard Mordaunt''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. His next door neighbour, [[Elladora Guffy]], was overly fond of practical joke [[spell]]s. She had a habit of [[charm]]ing Mordaunt's garden furniture to do things like spin unexpectedly. Ethelbard sent a letter complaining about Guffy to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''.<ref name="DP">{{DP}}: [[31 July]], [[1998]], Page 3</ref>
