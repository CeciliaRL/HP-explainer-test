'''Robert McGonagall Junior''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], who was the youngest child and second son of [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Robert McGonagall Senior]] and witch [[Isobel Ross]].<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|professor-mcgonagall}}</ref>

==Biography==
He revealed his [[magic]]al ability at a young age. His mother and older sister [[Minerva McGonagall|Minerva]] worked together to teach him and his older brother, [[Malcolm McGonagall|Malcolm]], that they could not go around flaunting their magic. They also worked to hide the "accidents and embarrassments" that the two boys' magic sometimes caused from their father.<ref name="pottermore" />

Robert eventually fathered at least one child. His offspring would often visit his sister's home in [[Hogsmeade]] during her brief marriage between [[1981]] and [[1984]].<ref name="pottermore" />

Robert was killed by [[Death Eaters]] during the height of the [[First Wizarding War]].<ref name="shortstories">[[Pottermore Presents]] - ''[[Short Stories from Hogwarts of Heroism, Hardship and Dangerous Hobbies]]'', Chapter 1 (''Minerva McGonagall'')</ref>
