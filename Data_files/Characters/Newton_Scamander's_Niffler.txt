This '''[[Niffler]]''' accompanied [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] as he researched for his upcoming book. It visited [[New York]] in [[1926]] and [[Paris]] in [[1927]].

==Biography==
===1926===
The Niffler was born sometime before December 1926 and was rescued by Newt Scamander, and consequently placed inside of his [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|magically-expanded suitcase full of magical beasts]].<ref name="FBS">{{FB|S}}</ref>

[[File:Niffler gold.gif|250px|left|thumb|Newt removing gold from the Niffler]]
In December of [[1926]] during Newt's trip to [[New York]], the Niffler escaped to steal a beggar's coin. It then sneaked into the [[Steen National Bank]] and caused mass chaos as it attempted to secure valuables and treasure. It eventually founds its way into the vaults, where it was captured by Newt.<ref name="FBS"/>

When [[Jacob Kowalski]] accidentally swapped his and Newt's cases, it was taken to the former's apartment. When Kowalski opened the case, he accidentally released a selection of Newt's creatures, one of which was the Niffler, that hid behind a photo of [[Jacob Kowalski's grandmother|Kowalski's grandmother]] to avoid being discovered by Newt.<ref name="FBS"/>

The Niffler eventually found its way to a downtown jewellery store where it attempted to evade Newt, the two of them causing massive amounts of property damage in the meantime. However, it was eventually captured again and placed back inside of the case.<ref name="FBS"/>

===1927===
[[File:Niffler finding Tina's footprints.gif|250px|left|thumb|Niffler finding Tina's footprints]]
In September of [[1927]], the Niffler was taken to [[Paris]] by Newt in the latter's attempt to find [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] and [[Credence Barebone]]. It was set on the ground of [[Place Cach√©e]] to sniff out Tina's scent and footprints. It soon after, found the footprints and was put back into the case, after Newt saw [[Yusuf Kama|a man]] and chased after his feather tracking him down.<ref name="COGS48">{{COG|S

[[File:Newt Niffler Blood pact.gif|250px|thumb|right|Newt taking the vial out of Niffler's pocket]]
The Niffler then snuck out of Newt's [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|case]] in the [[Lestrange Mausoleum|Lestrange Family Mausoleum]] where it secretely secured [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s [[Gellert Grindelwald's pendant|vial]] of his and [[Albus Dumbledore's file|Albus Dumbledore's]] blood from a long-ago [[blood pact]]. When [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] attacked a group of Aurors with [[Protego Diabolica|blue fire]], one of the Niffler's front paws was injured, causing it to walk with a painful limp.<ref name="COGS114">{{COG|S|114}}</ref> He was most likely healed as he could walk normally.<ref>{{COG|F}}</ref>

[[File:Albus newt Niffler walking on viaduct.gif|250px|left|thumb|Newt, Albus and the Niffler walking towards Hogwarts]]
As Newt took his suitcase to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] to meet with [[Albus Dumbledore]], he took out the vial, and when Dumbledore enquired as to how he got it, he showed him his [[Niffler]]. Newt then carefully set the Niffler down and walked across the [[Viaduct]] with [[Albus Dumbledore]] to the [[Hogwarts Castle]]. Albus asked Newt if the Niffler would like a cup of tea, but Newt replied saying he'll like a milk but hide the teaspoons.<ref name="COGS119">{{COG|S|119}}</ref>

==Physical description==
Like most [[Niffler]]s, Newt's Niffler had tan skin, black fur, a long snout, and partially-webbed paws. Some of the hair on its head was tinged with grey, perhaps a symbol of old age. It also had a small pouch on its belly that could fit much more than it seemed through use of natural magic similar to that of the [[Extension Charm|Undetectable Extension Charm]]. The Niffler looked like a cross between a [[mole]] and a platypus.

==Personality and traits==
The Niffler was incredibly intelligent and mischievous. It was able to recognise when it disobeyed Newt, yet continued to do it anyway. It also displayed recognition of the consequences of its actions, showing this when it shared an uneasy glance with Newt after the two crashed into the jewellery store's window.<ref name="FBS"/>

However, it later developed a gentler and more respectful personality, most notable when it stole Grindelwald's vial of blood for Newt, and when it was released in a Paris square and did not run off or steal from anyone other then sneaking a couple golden items from a shop front while Newt was talking with Jacob.<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Newton Scamander===
[[File:NewtonScamander-Profile-crop-0.png|200x200px|thumb|Newton Scamander, its owner]]
The two often competed for dominance during the Niffler's attempts at freedom. The Niffler recognised Newt's authority yet continued to run amok and steal from others. However, the duo soon developed a closer relationship as Newt trusted the Niffler enough to set free for short periods of time in a foreign city, and in turn the Niffler was able to procure [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald's]] blood vial.<ref name="FBS"/><ref name="COGS"/>

===The Beasts===
The Niffler was never said or shown to cause any harm to other beasts or interfere with their lives. Newt apparently trusted the Niffler to let it wander around [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|the suitcase]] unwatched, something he did not do with other creatures, such as the [[Erumpent]].<ref name="FBS"/><ref name="COGS"/>

===Possible offspring===
[[File:Baby nifflers.jpg|150x150px|left|The four younger Nifflers]]
In Newt's basement, four young Nifflers lived there. It is possible that they were the young of Newt's adult Niffler that found a mate sometime between December, [[1926]], and September, [[1927]], or was pregnant before then. However, it is equally possible that these young are the offspring of some other Niffler that Newt rescued, or were rescued on their own without a parent. One of them displays the same colour as the original Niffler.<ref name="FBS"/><ref name="COGS"/>

===Habitat===
[[File:Baby Niffler Cage WU.png|thumb|The baby Niffler's cage]]
The baby Nifflers' home was somewhat like a birdcage except beautifully ornate with rich fabrics, shining jewels, and of course, gold. They get tossed into this mini home after they finally got captured and taken away from their mischievous play when Newt arrived home and calmed down all his rowdy creatures.<ref name="FBS"/><ref name="COGS"/>

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|I have a love-hate relationship with that little guy|[[Eddie Redmayne]]|Pottermore}}
*[[Eddie Redmayne]], the actor who portrays [[Newton Scamander]] in the [[Fantastic Beasts (film series)|''Fantastic Beasts'' films]], jokingly commented that he had developed a "love hate" relationship with the fictional creature.
