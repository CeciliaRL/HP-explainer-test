'''Panju Weasley''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the son of [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Padma Patil]] in an [[alternate reality]] created by [[Albus Potter]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy]] when they [[Time-Turner|changed]] the events of the first task in the [[Triwizard Tournament]].<ref name="p1-a2-s9">{{CC|B|2|9}}</ref><ref name="p1-a2-s17">{{CC|B|2|17}}</ref>

==Biography==
Panju Weasley was born to [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Padma Patil]] sometime in the mid-[[2000s]].<ref name="p1-a2-s9" /><ref name="p1-a2-s17" /> He existed only in the [[alternate reality]] created by [[Albus Potter]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy]] [[Time-Turner|travelling back in time]] and changing the outcome of the first task of the [[Triwizard Tournament]].<ref name="p1-a2-s9" /><ref name="p1-a2-s17" /> In this universe, Ron married Padma instead of [[Hermione Granger]], since Hermione never dated [[Viktor Krum]], which in the main timeline made him jealous and prompted him to act on his feelings.<ref name="p1-a2-s9" /><ref name="p1-a2-s17" /><ref name="p1-a2-s16">{{CC|B|2|16}}</ref>

Panju attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="p1-a2-s9" /><ref name="p1-a2-s17" /> He bet his universe's version of his cousin [[Albus Potter]] that he couldn't get sorted into [[Gryffindor]].<ref name="p1-a2-s9" /> This prompted Albus to convince the [[Sorting Hat]] to place him in Gryffindor to spite Panju.<ref name="p1-a2-s9" />

He had a mischievous spirit and frequently got into trouble at Hogwarts.<ref name="p1-a2-s9" /><ref name="p1-a2-s17" /> According to his father, he usually laughed when confronted about his behaviour, and had a cocky smile that everyone wanted to wipe off his face.<ref name="p1-a2-s9" /> When Panju landed in trouble at Hogwarts during the 2020-2021 school year, his father went to the school to talk to him in person instead of sending a [[Howler]], since his mother thought this would be more effective.<ref name="p1-a2-s9" /> In another incident later that same school year, Panju ended up with no eyebrows and a "rather large" moustache after a mishap in [[Potions (class)|Potions]] class, prompting his father to once again pay a visit to Hogwarts to talk to him.<ref name="p1-a2-s17" />

Ron's comments about Panju helped Albus and Scorpius realise that their actions had changed history and created an alternate reality.<ref name="p1-a2-s9" /><ref name="p1-a2-s16" />

He was [[un-born]] when the Timeline was changed yet again, erasing him permanently from existence.
