'''Mallory Twiddle''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who wrote to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' in [[July]] [[1998]] to complain about how [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] was using [[sphinx]]es to guard its high security vaults.<ref name="wizardst">"[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/a-z/t.html Wizards, Witches and Beings: T]" on the Harry Potter Lexicon</ref><ref name="dp">"[http://www.hplex.info/about/sources/source_dp.html Daily Prophet newsletters]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> According to Twiddle, he ran into one of these sphinxes and spent an hour trying to solve its riddles, and was eventually chased out of the bank.<ref name="wizardst" />

==Etymology==
The name "Mallory" comes from an English surname which meant "unfortunate" in Norman French.

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{DH}}, a [[dragon]] is shown guarding the high security vaults at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]], contradicting the earlier revelation that sphinxes were used as guards in the ''[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]''. However, this dragon escaped during the [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)|Gringotts break-in]] on [[1 May]] [[1998]], causing substantial damage to the bank in the process. Twiddle's letter was published in the [[31 July]] [[1998]] issue of the ''Daily Prophet Newsletters'',<ref name="dp" /> so it's possible that Gringotts decided to switch to using sphinxes to guard its high security vaults after the break-in, in the hope of preventing further such incidents from occurring.
