'''Roger Malone''' (c. [[1979]]-[[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]].<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|the-original-forty}}</ref> He was in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] and was Sorted into either [[Hufflepuff]] or [[Ravenclaw]] house.<ref name=house />

==Etymology==
The name "Malone" comes from an Irish surname, an anglicised form of Ó Maoil Eoin meaning "descendent of a disciple of Saint John".

==Behind the scenes==
*Roger Malone can been deduced to have been listed as a [[Ravenclaw]] on the list of students in a page of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s notes shown on {{HPM}}. However, as two listed Hufflepuffs ([[Anthony Goldstein]] and [[Michael Corner]]) had their houses changed to Ravenclaw in the novels as published, two of those listed as Ravenclaws must have been changed to Hufflepuff. Malone may be one of those whose house was changed.
