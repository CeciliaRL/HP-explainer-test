'''Radulf''' (fl. [[12th century]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] blacksmith who lived in the same village as [[Goodwin Kneen]]. After [[Gunhilda Kneen]] got a touch of [[Dragon Pox]], Radulf was called in to play ''[[Chaser|Catcher]]'' (Chaser) in a game of ''[[Quidditch|Kwidditch]]'' (Quidditch) against a team from Ilkley. During the game, he took a ''[[Bludger|Blooder]]'' ([[Bludger]]) to the head when old [[Ugga]] failed to intercept it.<ref>{{QTA|R|3}}</ref>
