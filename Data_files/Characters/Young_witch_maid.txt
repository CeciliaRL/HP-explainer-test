{{Dialogue a-b-a|Maid|Housekeeping!|Noise|Roar-aw!|I'll come back later.|The maid of the [[Leaky Cauldron]]|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)}}
This '''young [[Wizardkind|witch]] maid''' worked for [[Tom]], the then-landlord of the [[Leaky Cauldron]]. In [[1993]], she knocked on the door of a room and announced herself as housekeeping. The [[Monstrous Leaky Cauldron guest|room's resident]] responded with a bellowing roar and slammed the door in her face. Completely unperturbed, she remarked that she would come back later and walked away. She pulled a wagon with cleaning supplies and had a magical broom that swept by itself.<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}}</ref>
