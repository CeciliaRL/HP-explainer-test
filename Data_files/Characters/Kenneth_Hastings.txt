==Etymology==
The name "Kenneth" is the anglicised form of both ''Coinneach'' and ''Cináed''. This name was borne by the Scottish king Kenneth (''Cináed'') mac Alpin, who united the Scots and Picts in the 9th century. It was popularised outside of Scotland by Sir Walter Scott, who used it for the hero in his novel ''The Talisman'' (1825). A famous bearer was the British novelist Kenneth Grahame (1859-1932), who wrote ''The Wind in the Willows''.
