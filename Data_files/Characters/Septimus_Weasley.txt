'''Septimus Weasley''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who married [[Cedrella Black]]. Because he was considered to be a [[blood traitor]] by the [[House of Black|Black]] family, the marriage caused Cedrella's disownment from the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree]].<ref>''[[House of Black|Black Family tree]]''</ref> The couple had three sons, including [[Arthur Weasley]].<ref>Although it has never been confirmed that Septimus and Cedrella are Arthur's parents, this can be inferred based on [[Sirius Black]]'s statement in {{OOTP|B|6}} that Arthur was "something like [his] second cousin once removed." The [[House of Black|Black family tree]] establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both [[Orion Black|Orion]] and [[Walburga Black]], Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree because both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown. See also this [[Talk:Cedrella Black|talk page]] and an [http://www.hplex.info/essays/essay-black-family-tree.html HPL essay] for more information.</ref> He was the father-in-law of [[Molly Weasley]], paternal grandfather of [[William Weasley|Bill]], [[Charles Weasley|Charlie]], [[Percy Weasley|Percy]], [[Fred Weasley|Fred]], [[George Weasley|George]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], great-grandfather to [[James Potter II|James]], [[Albus Potter|Albus]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Potter]], [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]], [[Louis Weasley|Louis]], [[Molly Weasley II|Molly II]], [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]], [[Fred Weasley II|Fred]] and [[Roxanne Weasley]] and [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley]].

==Etymology==
Septimus is a name of Latin origin. It means seventh.

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that Septimus was sorted in [[Gryffindor]] house, as his son and seven of his grandchildren were sorted into Gryffindor.
*Septimus is a Roman name meaning "seventh" in Latin.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/septimus Behind the Name: Septimus]</ref> This is interesting, considering that [[seven]] is the most magically powerful number, and that Septimus Weasley's son Arthur went on to have seven children. The name "Septimus" is usually given to a seventh-born son, so it can be assumed that Septimus Weasley had six older brothers.<ref>It was stated that Ginny Weasley was the first daughter in the Weasley family for seven generations. Septimus was only two generations prior to Ginny's.</ref>
*[[Bilius]] may be another of Septimus and Cedrella's sons; however this cannot be confirmed, as it is only known that he was the uncle of Ron and his siblings, not whether he was born a [[Weasley family|Weasley]] or a [[Prewett family|Prewett]].
*Septimus was probably the previous owner of [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]'s [[Wizard's Chess|Wizard Chess]] set, as Ron's set was described to be a hand-me-down from one of his grandfathers, though it might have probably been from his [[Molly Weasley's father|maternal grandfather]].
*Ironically there was a [[Septimus Malfoy|member]] of the [[Malfoy family]] with the name Septimus. Both families would become enemies during the twentieth century.
