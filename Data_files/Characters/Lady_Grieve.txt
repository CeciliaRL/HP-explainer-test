'''Lady Grieve''' (fl. [[1492]]) was a lady-in-waiting at the court of [[Henry VII|King Henry VII]].<ref name="WW">{{WW|hogwarts-ghosts}}</ref>

She met [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]], a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], while strolling in a park on the evening of [[30 October]], [[1492]]. Lady Grieve was confident that Sir Nicholas could [[Teeth-straightening spell|straighten her crooked teeth]], but his effort to do so backfired, causing her to grow a tusk instead. Sir Nicholas was nearly beheaded (earning him his nickname) the following morning as a result of this mishap.<ref name="JKRS">[http://web.archive.org/web/20110623034857/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=11 Nearly Headless Nick's background] at jkrowling.com</ref>
