This '''young man''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who lived during the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Leticia Somnolens]], the local [[Hag]], was jealous of [[Unidentified King's daughter|the King's daughter]] and tricked her into pricking her finger on a spindle tainted with [[Draught of Living Death]], sending her into a deep sleep. This young wizard smeared his lips with [[Wiggenweld Potion]], and then kissed the princess, curing her and bringing her out of the sleep. His story appears to be the source of inspiration for the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] fairy tale, [[Sleeping Beauty]].<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>
