'''Professor Valeria Myriadd''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Head of Gryffindor House]] during her life. After she died, numerous [[portrait]]s were hung of her at [[Hogwarts Castle]].

==Biography==
===Life===
Valeria was born someplace in either [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]],<ref name="PLACE">"Hogwarts just serves Britain and Ireland" from the South West News Service on [[8 July]], [[2000]] (transcript available [http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/0700-swns-alfie.htm here])</ref> and when she was eleven years old began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where she was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]].
She graduated at the end of her [[seventh year]] with good enough grades that she could return as a [[professor]],<ref name="TMOHP"/> and eventually rose to the position of [[Head of Gryffindor House]].<ref name="TMOHP"/> She died sometime prior to [[September]] [[1991]].<ref name="DEATH"/>

===[[1991–1992 school year]]===
By [[1991]], several portraits of Valeria hung at the main halls of [[Hogwarts Castle]], such as the [[Grand Staircase]]. In [[Gryffindor Tower]], one of her portraits guarded a secret passage to a [[Disused Bathroom (Fred and George's Shop)|disused bathroom]]. The password for said passage was "''Pig Snout''".<ref>{{PS|G}} - PS2 version</ref>

===[[1992-1993 school year]]===
By the [[1992-1993 school year|next school year]], her place in the Gryffindor Tower had been taken by [[Oraclitus Spheer]]. Her portrait was moved to the [[Hogwarts Library]] Annexe, hiding a shortcut to a section containing the original hand-written manuscript of ''[[Hogwarts: A History]]'', by [[Chroniculus Punnet]]. The password was "''Bibliophile''".<ref>{{COS|G}} - PS2 version</ref>
