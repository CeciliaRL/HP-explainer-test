'''Vlad the Impaler''' was the son of Count [[Vlad Drakul]]. He was the Prince of Wallachia, which later became [[Romania]]. Despite being the son of a known [[vampire]], [[Vlad Drakul]],<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref> it is unclear whether or not Vlad the Impaler was one as well.

==Behind the scenes==
*Little is known of vampires in [[J. K. Rowling]]'s work, but the existence of partial vampires hints that it is possible for a person to be born a vampire without the need of being "turned". Children of humans and vampires would otherwise always be human. This raises the question as to whether Vlad the Impaler is a half-vampire, vampire, or human, but nothing has been confirmed as of yet.
*[[Wikipedia:Vlad III the Impaler|Vladislav III]], also known as Vlad the Impaler, was an actual historical figure. He was Prince of {{wplink|Wallachia}} who reigned three times between [[1448]] and [[1476]]. His epithet, "Impaler", originated from his favoured method of executing those who opposed him. Vlad III is indeed widely speculated to have been the inspiration behind the title character of [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''Dracula''.
*[[Gary Oldman]], who plays [[Sirius Black]] in the [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' films]], played Vlad the Impaler in the [[1992]] film, ''{{wplink|Bram Stoker's Dracula}}''.
