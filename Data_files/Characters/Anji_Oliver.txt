{{Quote|Amateur footage has not yielded any likely suspects. Anji Oliver, of Ilford, Essex filmed the devastation on her mobile phone. Her footage clearly shows each blast, but close examination of her video appears to show the blast being fired onto the bridge, as opposed to explosive devices placed on the bridge. But the multiple blasts come from different directions, and no source can be identified.|[[Jamie Wolpert (in-universe)|Jamie Wolpert]], "[[Millennium Bridge|Bridge disaster]] hits London" in ''[[The Guardian]]'' (July, [[1996]])|Harry Potter Limited Edition}}
