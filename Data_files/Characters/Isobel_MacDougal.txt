'''Isobel MacDougal''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[wizardkind|witch]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. She was sorted into the [[Ravenclaw]] house.

==Behind the scenes==
*The existence of this character cannot be considered [[canon]]. In {{PS}}, the [[Sorting ceremony]] proceeds alphabetically, and [[Neville Longbottom]] is immediately followed by [[Morag MacDougal]].
*As revealed by [[J. K. Rowling]] on {{PM}}, this character was originally named "Katrina", but this was crossed out on her hand-written list of the forty students in [[Harry Potter|Harry's]] year and replaced with "Isobel".<ref>{{WW|the-original-forty}} on {{PM}}</ref>
*As an Isobel McDougal was never featured in a published book in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|series]], but a [[Morag MacDougal]] was, it is possible that the two are siblings (given the shared last name), though it is debated if the two are independent characters or if Isobel was simply renamed Morag.

==Etymology==
"Dougall" is from the Gaelic Dubhgall, or "dark stranger," and "Mac" is "son of."
