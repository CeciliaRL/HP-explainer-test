This '''Slytherin knight''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who had a [[portrait]] hung of himself at [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="PS"/><ref name="CS"/>

==Biography==
===[[1991–1992 school year]]===
In [[Harry Potter]]'s first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], he was guarding a secret room in the upper castle's [[Upper Castle Portrait Room|Portrait Room]], concealing an [[Knockback Jinx Duo|advanced form]] of the [[Knockback Jinx]]. The password was "Wolf's Bane".<ref name="PS">{{PS|G}} - PS1 version</ref>

===[[1992–1993 school year]]===
A year later, his portrait had been moved, and now guarded the way to the Slytherin Duelling Dungeon.<ref name="CS">{{COS|G}} - PS1 version</ref> Another identical portrait was also created that guarded a hot-air well-lifting room inside an area behind a bookcase in the [[Knights' Room]]. He was kept with company by the [[Unidentified Hufflepuff lady|Hufflepuff lady]].

==Behind the scenes==
*This wizard may have passed away sometime prior to [[1991]] as many portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] depict deceased individuals.
*His attitude against [[Harry Potter]] was good when he spoke to him in the two secret rooms behind the bookcases and bad when it was guarding the Slytherin Duelling Dungeon.
