The '''fiancé''' of [[Honoria]] was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who worked in the [[Improper Use of Magic Office]]. Honoria called off their engagement, telling people it was because she learned "he had a [[Hairy Heart]]" (a [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] expression for an unfeeling person), but rumour had it that she had really been disturbed to catch him in the middle of fondling some [[Horklump]]s.<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|H}}</ref>
