'''Chris Huhne''' was a British politician and the environment spokesman for the [[Liberal Party]] in the [[1990s]]. In July of [[1996]], the leader of the party, [[Menzies|Sir Menzies]], resigned from his post and Huhne (whose supporters briefed against Sir Menzies) announced his candidacy to the leadership of the party, as did [[Nick Clegg]], home affairs spokesman. These events were covered by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:TheGuardian.png|this image]])</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The listing of [[Wikipedia:Chris Huhne|Chris Huhne]] as a candidate to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1996 is anachronistic, as at the time Huhne had not yet started his political career, and was a City entrepreneur.
