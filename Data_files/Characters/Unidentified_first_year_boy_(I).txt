==Biography==
{{Quote|An autograph from Wigtown Wanderer [[Ethan Parkin]]? Brilliant!|This boy to [[Skye Parkin]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
He was born somewhere in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]] during the early [[1970s]]. He began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1985â€“1986 school year]].<ref name="HM2"/>

In his first year, he spotted [[Skye Parkin]] and [[Jacob's sibling]] in the [[common room]] of his house. Skye told the boy to leave and tell no one, which he agreed to do when Skye promised him an autograph from [[Ethan Parkin|her father]].<ref name="HM2"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Which house he is in depends on that of [[Jacob's sibling]] (chosen by the player). If Jacob's sibling is in [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]] or [[Slytherin]], this boy is in [[Ravenclaw]]. If [[Jacob's sibling]] is in Ravenclaw, he is in Slytherin.
*He is a fan of the [[Quidditch team]] [[Wigtown Wanderers]].<ref name="HM2"/>
*It is possible that he is [[Teddy Taylor]].
