'''Perseus Ecklington''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who, in his youth, courted [[Daisy Twemlove]].<ref name="BPsleepingpotion">{{WBP}} - see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-PJsIbGX8&list=PLu-YMfPspAuGcYXaC2J1A2gb-0Zp34GI3&index=18 this video]</ref>

On the eve of Ecklington's wedding to Daisy Twemlove, [[Norville Bezerko]], his love rival, slipped a powerful [[Sleeping Potion]] into his [[butterbeer]] mug, sending him into a deep death-like sleep. Bezerko prompty presented himself at Daisy's house, telling her that Ecklington had died of panic at the prospect of marrying her. An unsuspecting Daisy accepted a proposal of marriage from Bezerko the moment Ecklington was buried.<ref name="BPsleepingpotion"/>

Ecklington was put in a coffin, and, just as [[Funeral of Perseus Ecklington|he was being lowered into the ground]], he woke up, as the effects of the [[Sleeping Potion]] had worn off. Ecklington soon realised Bezerko's scheme, and a [[Duelling|brawl]] ensued. Bezerko was left with an [[elephant]]'s trunk and six ears, thus hampering his chances of finding another bride, and Daisy Twemlove was reunited with Perseus Ecklington.<ref name="BPsleepingpotion"/>
