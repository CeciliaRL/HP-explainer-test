==Etymology==
From an occupational surname originally belonging to a person who was a steward. It is ultimately derived from Old English ''stig'' "house" and ''weard'' "guard". As a given name, it arose in 19th-century Scotland in honour of the Stuart royal family, which produced several kings and queens of Scotland and Britain between the 14th and 18th centuries.

==Behind the scenes==
*This character's name is presumably a tribute to [[Stuart Craig]], who was the production designer on of all the ''Harry Potter'' [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]].
