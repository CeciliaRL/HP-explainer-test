}}'''Parkin '''(fl. [[1422]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Wizardkind|witch or wizard]] who played as [[Seeker]] for the original [[Wigtown Wanderers]] team during the [[15th century]] and was a child of Wanderers founder [[Walter Parkin]]. They were a formidable team during this time who won most of their matches, perhaps partly because Walter himself used to attend every game holding his wand in one hand and a meat cleaver in the other.<ref>{{QTA|R|7}}</ref>
