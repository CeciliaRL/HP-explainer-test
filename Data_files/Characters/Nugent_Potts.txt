'''Nugent Potts''' was a [[Quidditch referee]] in [[1894]]. While refereeing a match involving the [[Appleby Arrows]], he was pierced through the nose by an arrow [[Arrow-shooting spell|fired from the wand]] of an Arrows supporter. This accident led the [[Department of Magical Games and Sports]] to ban Arrow supporters from firing arrows from their wands when the team scored.<ref>{{QTA|R|7}}</ref>
