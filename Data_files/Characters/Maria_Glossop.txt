==Etymology==
The name "Maria" is the Latin form of Greek Μαρια, from Hebrew מִרְיָם. Maria is the usual form of the name in many European languages, as well as a secondary form in other languages such as English (where the common spelling is Mary). In some countries, for example Germany, Poland and Italy, Maria is occasionally used as a masculine middle name.
