This '''Muggle boy''' was living in [[Godric's Hollow]] in the [[1980s]].

==Biography==
{{Quote|Nice costume, Mister!|[[Non-magic people|Muggle]] boy residing in [[Godric's Hollow]] to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}

The boy was presumably born in the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] part of [[Godric's Hollow]]. On [[Hallowe'en]] in [[1981]], the boy came across [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Thinking that the Dark Lord was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] in a [[Hallowe'en]] disguise, he made a cheerful comment. Upon seeing Voldemort's face, however, he fled in terror. Voldemort considered killing him, but decided it was "unnecessary", as he had [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|more important matters]] to attend to.<ref>{{DH}}</ref>
