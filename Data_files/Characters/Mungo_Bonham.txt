==Behind the scenes==

He was also known as a founder of the [[Wikipedia:Glasgow Cathedral|Glasgow Cathedral]]. A Feast day for St Mungo, also known as St Mungo's Day,<ref>'''[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/myleaky/events/503 The-Leaky-Cauldron.org]''': ''St Mungo's Day''</ref> is observed on the [[13 January|13th of January]] every year after he was canonised.

==Etymology==
The name "Mungo" is possibly derived from Welsh ''mwyn'' "gentle, kind". This was a nickname of the 6th-century Saint Kentigern.

The surname "Bonham" is an Anglicisation of the French surname "Bonhomme", which itself is derived from the Old French "bon homme" meaning "good man".
