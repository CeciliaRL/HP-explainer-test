==Etymology==
The name "Alison" is the Norman French diminutive of ''Aalis''. It has often been construed to mean "truthful". It was common in England and France in the Middle Ages, and was later revived in the 20th century. Variant spellings have substituted "y" for "i", or included an extra "l" in the spelling.
