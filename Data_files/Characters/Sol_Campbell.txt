'''Sulzeer Jeremiah "Sol" Campbell''' was a professional [[football]] player who played for the [[England national football team]] by [[July]] of [[1997]]. By that time, he had played seventy games for the team, culminating in a win against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] at [[Wembley]] Stadium. When team captain [[John Terry]] showed signs of a reoccuring knee injury, manager [[Steve McClaren]] decided to have Campbell stand in for him at an upcoming game against [[Russia national football team|Russia]]. As noted by ''[[The Guardian]]'', this would be the first time since [[January]] of that year that Campbell made two appearances in that short of a time frame.<ref name="HPLEG">{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:TheGuardian.png|this image]])</ref>
