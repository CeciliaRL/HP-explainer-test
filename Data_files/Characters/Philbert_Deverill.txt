'''Philbert Deverill''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was the manager of [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch team|team]] [[Puddlemere United]]<ref name=":0">[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[8 February]], [[1999]], Page 3</ref>. He once said to the [[Daily Prophet]] that Puddlemere United would change their robe colours from mud-brown to something "''more striking''"<ref name=":0" />. He was as mystified as everyone else when his side hit a winning streak.

==Etymology==
The name "Philbert" is an early variant of ''Filibert'' altered by association with Greek φιλος (''philos'') "dear, beloved". This was the name of a 7th-century Frankish saint. Another famous bearer was Philibert de l'Orme (1510-1570), a French Renaissance architect.
