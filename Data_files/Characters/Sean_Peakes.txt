'''Sean Peakes''' was a [[Hufflepuff]] [[Wizardkind|student]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
He bought the last [[Reusable Hangman]] that [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] had in stock in [[1996]]. At Hogwarts later that year, a group of [[Slytherin]]s tried to steal the game from him, so he hid from them in the [[Clock Tower]]. [[Harry Potter]], who was looking for a Reusable Hangman for [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], found him there, and he agreed to give the game to Harry in exchange for three [[Stink Pellets]]. He planned to use these Stink Pellets in order to drive off the Slytherins if they gave him trouble again.<ref name="HBPG"/>

He may have been related to [[Glanmore Peakes]] or to [[Jimmy Peakes]], who attended Hogwarts around the same time, but was in [[Gryffindor]].
