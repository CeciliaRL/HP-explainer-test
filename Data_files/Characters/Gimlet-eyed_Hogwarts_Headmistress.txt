This '''unidentified female Head''' was a gimlet-eyed [[Wizardkind|witch]] who, at some point, became [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="OOTP" />

==Biography==
In [[1995]], she threatened fellow Hogwarts Headmaster [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] with her unusually thick wand when he told the current Hogwarts Headmaster [[Albus Dumbledore]] that he didn't feel like passing a message onto his great-great grandson, [[Sirius Black]]. Phineas Black apparently took her seriously enough to rapidly revise his position.<ref name="OOTP" />

In [[1998]], she, along with the other portraits of former Heads, gave [[Harry Potter]] a standing ovation after he [[Voldemort's Last Stand|killed]] the [[Dark Arts|Dark]] [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].<ref name="DH">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
This witch seemed to have a forceful personality, as she was quick to threaten Phineas Nigellus Black with her wand when he ignored Dumbledore's request. She was apparently rather intimidating, as she was taken seriously by Black. Due to this, she may have been a skilled duellist when she was alive.

Her portrait appeared to be extremely loyal towards Albus Dumbledore and presumably towards whoever was the current headmaster/headmistress.<ref name="OOTP" />

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that this [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] was the [[Headteacher of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during 1792]].
*At one point, she threatened Phineas Black with her wand. It's unknown if portraits can use magic within their portraits, though Phineas's reaction indicates that she could potentially harm him. It's also possible that she simply would've used her wand as a club.
