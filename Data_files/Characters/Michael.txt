==Biography==
[[File:Fred George Michael OOTP 1.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Fred and George comfort Michael in 1996]]
Michael started his education at Hogwarts in the mid-[[1990s]]. Upon arriving at Hogwarts, Michael was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|house]].<ref name="OOTPF"/>

During the [[1995–1996 school year]], [[Fred and George Weasley]] comforted him after [[Dolores Umbridge]] made him use a [[Black Quill|blood quill]] to write lines after he was caught pulling a rebellious prank on Umbridge, telling him that his wounds were already healing, and that the pain would eventually go away. Shortly after this, he was joined by [[Harry Potter]] in the courtyard when Umbridge turned up, because it was then that the Weasley twins decided to put their [[Fred and George Weasley's departure from Hogwarts|plan of escape]] into action, a plan that Michael witnessed and supported.<ref name="OOTPF">{{OOTP|F}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Michael comes from the Hebrew Mikha-el, meaning "Who is like God?"<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/michael Behind The Name - Michael]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Michael has only appeared in {{OOTP|FA}}. There was no mention about him in the book.
*Michael may have been a member of Dumbledore's Army to have served detention using the Blood Quill in the film adaptation, as all members listed on Dumbledore's Army's parchment were punished as a group. There were, however, multiple other reasons to serve detention, seeing as in the film adaptation Umbridge and the Ministry passed at least one-hundred and thirty-six [[Educational Decree]]s.
