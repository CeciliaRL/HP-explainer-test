{{Quote|Harry had deliberately left the trial of the Keepers until last, hoping for an emptier stadium and less pressure on all concerned. Unfortunately, however, all the rejected players and a number of people who had come down to watch after a lengthy breakfast had joined the crowd by now, so that it was larger than ever.|Harry laments the large crowd that has gathered to watch the Gryffindor Keeper Trials|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
In [[September]] [[1996]], a number of '''unidentified spectators''' attended the [[Quidditch]] trials for the position of [[Keeper]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], under the [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|captaincy]] of [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="HBP11"/>

The various supporters each had a favourite as for whom they wished to see win the position, with most supporting either [[Ronald Weasley]] or [[Cormac McLaggen]].<ref name="HBPF"/>

{{Quote|Come on, Weasley! ... Yeah, Ron! ... Go on, Cormac!|The spectators|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)}}
Most of the vocal supporters seemed to favour Ronald Weasley, though there was at least one holdout for Cormac McLaggen.<ref name="HBPF">{{HBP|F}} - Chapter 10 (''Hermione's Helping Hand'')</ref> Ultimately, Ronald Weasley claimed the position, though not without a "[[Confundus Charm|helping hand]]" from [[Hermione Granger]].<ref name="HBP11">{{HBP|B|11}}</ref>
