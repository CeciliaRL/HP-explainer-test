==Biography==
He distrusted [[Hermione Granger]] ([[Polyjuice Potion|disguised]] as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]) and [[Ronald Weasley]] (disguised as Dragomir Despard), as [[Griphook]] said, they knew Hermione was an imposter. He was standing in the entrance and stepped forward when ''Bellatrix'' denied to give her wand to [[Bogrod]].

After the break-in, Teffington was summoned to [[Malfoy Manor]], where he was killed by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], in rage at having lost [[Hufflepuff's Cup|one of his Horcruxes]], along with other guards and goblins.<ref name="script"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*He is played by [[Anthony Allgood]] in {{DH|F2}}. He is unnamed in the film, but Bogrod refers to him as Teffington in the original screenplay.<ref name="script"/>
*He may be [[Unidentified Gringotts guard (I)|Marius's fellow guard]], who was standing watch at the doors in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|novel]].
