{{Quote|The Earl was a tyrannical bully who made the lives of the villagers miserable. He doled out dreadful punishments for the slightest misdeeds: ''[…]'' young women who did not curtsey low enough when he passed were forced into service at the castle ''[…]''.|[[Miranda Goshawk]], ''[[Book of Spells]]''.|Wonderbook: Book of Spells}}
