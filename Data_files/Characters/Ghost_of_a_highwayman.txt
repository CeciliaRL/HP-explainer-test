This '''[[ghost]] of a highwayman''' resided at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. In [[1993]], he jumped through a window in the [[Entrance Hall]] on his ghost horse, sending ghostly debris flying without doing any actual damage. He then rode into the [[Great Hall]], holding a severed head in the air by its hair, a [[Unidentified ghost (VII)|ghost knight]] mounted on another [[Unidentified ghost horse (I)|ghost horse]] was chasing after him.<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Connecting the title of a highwayman and that he stole the head of another ghost, this could be the ghost of [[Wikipedia:Dick Turpin|Richard "Dick" Turpin]], an English man known as a burglar, horse thief and robber. If that is true [[Unidentified ghost horse (I)|the horse]] he is riding could be Black Bess, Turpin's black horse.
