'''Alastair''' was a [[spider]] who lived in the [[Cupboard Under the Stairs|cupboard under the stairs]] at [[4 Privet Drive]]. He was named by [[Harry Potter]] who, neglected by his [[Petunia Dursley|aunt]] and [[Vernon Dursley|uncle]], would speak to him frequently and considered him a friend.<ref>[http://io9.com/5820032/ ''The Lost Harry Potter Character You Never Got to Meet''], [http://io9.com io9]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|Alastair. It was a spider in the closet, in the cupboard in the beginning, who [[Harry Potter|he]] had befriended and talked to. My vision of the first movie was quite different in terms of how you first perceived him. There was a spider in there and all these broken soldiers that he had filched from the rubbish [[bin]] of [[Dudley Dursley|Dudley]]'s [bedroom]. And he had this broken army and he would talk to Alastair. And so when [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] arrived in the motorcycle you wondered if maybe Harry was mad, and was imagining being rescued. Then you found out it was real. That was my original vision of the movie.|[[Steve Kloves]]}}
*This character was created for {{PS|FA}} by [[Steve Kloves]], but was ultimately cut.
*It is known that some magical spiders, likeÂ [[Acromantula]]s, are sentient and can communicate with humans. It is therefore possible that Alastair was genuinely able to converse with Harry, unbeknownst to the Dursleys.
