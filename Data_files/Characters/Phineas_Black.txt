'''Phineas Black''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], the second eldest son of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] and his wife [[Ursula Flint]] and brother of [[Cygnus Black II|Cygnus]], [[Sirius Black II|Sirius]], [[Belvina Black|Belvina]] and [[Arcturus Black II|Arcturus]]. He was disowned for supporting [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] rights and removed from the [[House of Black|Black family tree]].<ref>''[[House of Black|Black family tree]]''</ref>

It is unknown whether Phineas ever sired children, but if he did, his patrilineal descendants must have died out by [[1996]] because his great-great-nephew [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] was the last of the Blacks.

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on a statement by [[Horace Slughorn]], Phineas may have been a member of the [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. However, Phineas would have attended in the [[1880s]] or the [[1890s]], when Slughorn was not [[Potions (class)|Potions]] teacher.
*Phineas was named after his [[Phineas Nigellus Black|father]], but ironically, this son became Phineas Nigellus's greatest shame.
*On the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]] from the film Phineas is depicted as a red hat with a black hole. His name is misspelled '''Phineus''' on the tapestry, and so is the name of [[Phineas Nigellus Black|his father]]. This may be because the names are also incorrectly spelled on a tree drawn by [[J. K. Rowling]]. The hand drawn family tree was given to Book Aid International.
*Based on his estimated birth year(s), Phineas would have attended Hogwarts around the same time as [[Albus Dumbledore]], the latter of whom was born in 1881. While Dumbledore was Sorted into [[Gryffindor]], Phineas was likely Sorted into [[Slytherin]]. Both Phineas and Dumbledore also would have attended Hogwarts while Phineas's father, [[Phineas Nigellus Black]], was likely the Headmaster. Given Phineas's support of Muggle rights, a belief he shared with Dumbledore, it is possible that Phineas and Dumbledore may have been acquaintances or friends. This could also explain Dumbledore's seeming fondness for the portrait of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] in the books, as Dumbledore may have had a friendly relationship with his son.

==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Phinehas|Phinehas]] was the grandson of Aaron in the Bible. He stopped a plague by killing two of the sinners who caused it. His name is sometimes spelled as ''Phineas''.
