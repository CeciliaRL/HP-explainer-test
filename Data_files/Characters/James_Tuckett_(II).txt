==Biography==
In his [[1996-1997 school year|first year]], he caught [[Draco Malfoy]] trying to steal the [[Birds on the Seventh Floor|birds]] in the [[seventh-floor corridor]], but was too frightened to tell anyone about it due to being intimidated by Draco and his [[Draco Malfoy's gang|friends]]. [[Harry Potter]] gave him some [[Cauldron Cake]]s and afterwards he felt good enough to tell Harry what he knew. James also played informal [[Quidditch]] matches with other students during his [[first year]].<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}} - NDS version</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "James" is the English form of the Late Latin name Iacobus which was derived from Ιακωβος (Iakobos), the New Testament Greek form of the Hebrew name Ya'aqov.
