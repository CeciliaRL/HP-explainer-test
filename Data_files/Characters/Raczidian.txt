'''Raczidian''' was a [[Dark Wizard]] who, according to an ancient story, attacked [[Illyius' village|a wizarding village]], only to be foiled by the [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] of [[Illyius]].<ref name="WBoS" />

==Biography==
According to legend, Raczidian was a [[Dark Wizard|Dark]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] who lived with a colony of [[Dementor]]s in a [[Raczidian's castle|black castle]] in a dense forest, which surrounded a nearby mountain village inhabited by fellow witches and wizards. For many years, he and the unearthly denizens of the castle co-existed peacefully with the villagers, leaving them alone, while they in kind kept out of the part of the woods where his castle was located.<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}}</ref>

One day, Raczidian noticed a beautiful girl from the village, [[Eliana]], while she was collecting berries in the woods. Taken by her, he decided she would make an ideal wife, and sent a message to her parents demanding her hand. They refused. Raczidian thus threatened to send his Dementors to destroy the village unless Eliana was brought to him.<ref name="WBoS" />

The villagers opted to put up a fight rather than surrender to Raczidian's ultimatum. At first, they succeeded in holding at bay the Dementors that Raczidian unleashed upon them with the combined might of their [[Patronus Charm|Patronuses]], but gradually the sheer number of foes began to overwhelm them. Just when it looked as if all hope was lost, however, [[Illyius]] — a shy, young orphan who had been told to sit out the battle because the village elders thought his Patronus was too feeble to be of any use — cast the Patronus Charm. The [[mouse]] that sprang from Illyius's wand shone brilliantly and brought the Dementors to a halt.<ref name="WBoS" />

Enraged that something so small should thwart him, Raczidian decided to enter the fray himself and attempted to summon a Patronus to ward off Illyius's mouse. However, he failed to remember that only the pure of heart can produce a Patronus, and thus for the first time in history, it was revealed what happens when a competent but unworthy wizard or witch attempts the spell. [[Maggot]]s shot out of Raczidian's [[wand]] and quickly devoured him as they engulfed his body.<ref name="WBoS" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]: '''Raczidian was highly proficient and accomplished in the dark arts, being a fearsome and malevolent [[Dark Wizard]]. He was presumably very adept in the casting of various [[Dark charm]]s and [[spell]]s, handling dark objects and brewing dark [[potion]]s, for example. He was particularly skilled at handling and commanding dark [[creature]]s, such as [[Dementor]]s, which guarded his castle and were successfully ordered by him to attack a wizarding village.<ref name="WBoS" />

==Possessions==
*'''[[Raczidian's wand|Wand]]''': Raczidian owned a [[wand]], which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[Wand core]]. He heavily utilised his wand to practise the [[Dark Arts]], so it can be presumed its materials were suitable for performing dark magic.<ref name="WBoS" />
*'''[[Raczidian's castle|Castle]]''': Raczidian owned and lived in a black castle in a dark forest, with a colony of [[Dementor]]s.<ref name="WBoS"/>
