'''Sinistra''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard or witch]].<ref name="JKRS">"[[:File:Early draft workingsJKR.png|''Early draft workings'']]" from {{JKRS}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Sinistra" is the name of a [[Wikipedia:Sinistra|star]] in the constellation [[Wikipedia:Ophiuchus|Ophiuchus]], which probably means that the family, like the [[House of Black]], named their children after those of stars and constellations.

==Behind the scenes==
*Professor Sinistra was apparently considered for the role of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]], as the name was written next to those of [[Enid Pettigrew]] and [[Oakden Hernshaw]]. However, the name was not written with a year next to it, implying that the name may have just been considered.
