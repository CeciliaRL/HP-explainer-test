'''Gunnar<ref name="Archive">{{AM}}</ref> Grimmson''' (fl. [[1927]]) was a [[Dark Wizard]] that worked as a [[bounty hunter]] in the [[1920s]], who was also a follower of [[Gellert Grindelwald]].<ref name="pmn">[https://www.pottermore.com/news/warner-bros-reveals-the-new-characters-coming-to-the-next-fantastic-beasts-film Warner Bros. reveals the new characters coming to the new Fantastic Beasts film] at {{PM}}</ref>

==Biography==

In [[1927]], Gunnar hid in the corner of a [[British Ministry of Magic Hearing Room|hearing room]] and came out after [[Newton Scamander]] refused to assist the [[British Ministry of Magic]] to hunt down and kill [[Credence Barebone]]. Grimmson was hired to travel to [[Paris]] in order to kill [[Credence Barebone]]. Grimmson also, however, secretly received instructions from [[Gellert Grindelwald]] to kill [[Irma Dugard]], to deprive Credence of the answers he was seeking and to push him into Grindelwald's arms. Grimmson accomplished his task during a swift [[Attack on Irma Dugard|attack]]. Credence attempted to stop and slay Grimmson in revenge, but the latter was able to maintain a particularly strong protective [[Shield Charm]] to protect himself from Credence's [[Obscurial]] form long enough to [[Apparition|Disapparate]] and escape.<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Due to his status as a [[bounty hunter]] for the [[British Ministry of Magic]], Gunnar Grimmson was a rather sinister and ruthless individual, with a vocal and mutual dislike of [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], and seemingly only being loyal to [[Gellert Grindelwald]].<ref name="COGS"/>

Indeed, Grimmson was the polar opposite of [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] - Newt was a kindly caretaker of [[beast]]s, while Grimmson was a vicious beast hunter. He was also a cold-blooded and merciless killer, as he coldly and swiftly murdered [[Irma Dugard]] with the [[Killing Curse]] in order to fulfil Grindelwald's wishes, showing him to be a very dangerous [[Dark Wizard]].<ref name="COGS"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Bounty hunter]] skills''': Gunnar Grimmson was a highly skilled bounty hunter, since the [[British Ministry of Magic]] trusted him with the important mission of tracking down and killing the extremely dangerous [[Obscurial]] [[Credence Barebone]], while [[Gellert Grindelwald]] trusted Grimmson to kill [[Irma Dugard]].<ref name="COGS"/>
[[File:Grimmson_kills_Irma.gif|thumb|250px|Grimmson ruthlessly and swiftly killing Irma Durgard with the Killing Curse]]
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Grimmson, as a bounty hunter, was highly proficient in the Dark Arts, swiftly casting the [[Killing Curse]] which killed Irma Dugard. Casting the [[Unforgivable Curses]] require considerable [[magic]]al skill and malice to perform correctly. Grimmson also used what appeared to be a [[dark charm]] that made Nagini stick to the wall, with seemingly no way to escape until Credence destroyed the wall she was stuck in.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Grimmson seemed to be very skilled with charms, as he was able to cast and maintain an extremely powerful [[Shield Charm]], enough to block the devastating attacks of Credence's [[Obscurus]] long enough to Disapparate away to safety.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Grimmson, like most adult wizards, was capable of Apparating at will, though he seemed more skilled than most, managing to Disapparate from Credence without relinquishing his Shield Charm until the very moment he was gone, without losing concentration.<ref name="COGS"/>

==Etymology==
*Gunnar is a name of Nordic origin (Gunnarr in Old Norse), meaning  fighter, soldier, and attacker, and stem from an old Viking saying which means "brave and bold warrior". (G''unnr'' "war" and ''arr'' "warrior").
*Grimmson is a patronymic name of Icelandic origin meaning "son of Grímur", ultimately meaning "fierce", "to thunder", or (in the context of an alternate name for Odin), "mask".

==Behind the scenes==
*Grimmson was played by [[Ingvar Eggert Sigurðsson]] in {{COG}}.<ref name="pmn"/>
*Based on his name and the nationality of his actor, Grimmson may have been born in Iceland or been of Icelandic descent.
*Newt and Gunnar most likely had a negative history with each other, given their very acrimonious exchange in the Ministry.
