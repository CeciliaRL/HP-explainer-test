'''Clarke''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Muggle|No-Maj]] who served as an [[Wikipedia:District attorney|Assistant District Attorney]] in the [[1920s]].<ref name="fb-chronicle">"[http://www.gazette-du-sorcier.com/Compte-rendu-ouverture-de-l-exposition-Harry-Potter-a-Bruxelles-pour-Noel Compte-rendu : ouverture de l’exposition Harry Potter à Bruxelles pour Noël]" from the Gazette du Sorcier {{see image|File:New York Chronicle - Monday Dec 1926 (HQ).png}}</ref><ref name="eveningworld">[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030193/1922-11-21/ed-1/seq-1/ Front page of the 21 November 1922 issue of ''The Evening World''] from Chronicling America</ref>

On [[6 December]] [[1926]], Clarke convinced judge [[Rufus Foster]] to reconsider his decision to summarily dismiss a [[wikipedia:grand jury|grand jury]], which had leaked a court document to the press.<ref name="fb-chronicle" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> Thus, Foster instead ordered the jury to deliver any indictments they had found within three days, at which point they would be dismissed.<ref name="fb-chronicle" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> The incident was reported in the 6 December 1926 issue of the ''[[New York Chronicle]]''.<ref name="fb-chronicle" /><ref name="eveningworld" />

==Behind the scenes==
*The text of the article mentioning Clarke in the [[:File:New York Chronicle - Monday Dec 1926 (HQ).png|prop issue]] of the ''[[New York Chronicle]]'' featured in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' was taken from the real [[21 November]] [[1922]] issue of ''[[wikipedia:The Evening World|The Evening World]]''. This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in [[1926]], but the actual historical event referenced happened in 1922.<ref name="eveningworld" />
