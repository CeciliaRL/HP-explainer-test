This '''White-Haired Healer''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who attended the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[May]] of [[1998]].
==Biography==
Born somewhere in [[Europe]], this [[Wizardkind|witch]] was informed of the [[Wizardkind|existence of magic]] and was trained as a witch.
On [[2 May]], [[1998]], she was called to [[Hogwarts Castle]] for the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and helped as a [[healer]] there. 
==Physical appearance==
This witch had greyish white hair and fair skin; she wore the uniform of a [[healer]]. It can be noted that even when bending over a corpse, she managed to retain rather good posture.
==Magical abilities and skills==
The witch, whoever she was, has a few skills:
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': She was called upon to act as a [[healer]] in the battle, and hence it is reasonable to assume that she was well-versed in this field of magic.
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': She managed to survive at least half of the battle, and given that [[Death Eaters|her opponents]] sought [[Killing Curse|to kill]], it is fair to say she was good in this field of magic as well.
==Behind the scenes==
*This woman's name is unknown.
*She may be the wife of [[Unidentified Hogwarts white haired teacher during the Battle of Hogwarts|the man of the same-colour hair in the battle]]. Alternatively, she may be a teacher, member of staff, member of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], or even a resident of [[Hogsmeade]].
