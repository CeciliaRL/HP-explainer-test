'''Walter Parkin''' (fl. [[1422]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and butcher. In [[1422]], his seven children - four sons and three daughters - formed the [[Wigtown Wanderers]] [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch team|team]]. Walter often attended matches holding his wand in one hand, and a [[meat cleaver]] in the other. Opposing teams were often intimidated by his presence on the sidelines.<ref name="QTA7">{{QTA|R|7}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Walter" comes from a Germanic name meaning "ruler of the army", composed of the elements ''wald'' "rule" and ''hari'' "army". The Normans brought it to England, where it replaced the Old English cognate ''Wealdhere''. A famous bearer of the name was Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), a Scottish novelist who wrote 'Ivanhoe' and other notable works.<ref>http://www.behindthename.com/name/walter</ref>

"Ruler of the Army" is possibly a reference to the "army of children" that made up the Wigtown Wanderers team.
