__NOTOC__
'''Eleanor Sarah Gibbs'''<ref>Closed captions on the DVD/Blu-ray of {{DH|F1}}</ref> was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who was reported missing on the ''[[Potterwatch]]'' wireless programme in [[1997]]. Her disappearance was most likely linked to a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] attack.

==Etymology==
The name "Eleanor" is from the Old French form of the Provençal name ''Aliénor''. It was first borne by the influential Eleanor of Aquitaine (12th century), who was the queen of Louis VII, the king of France, and later Henry II, the king of England. She was named Aenor after her mother, and was called by the Provençal phrase alia Aenor "the other Aenor" in order to distinguish her from her mother.

==Behind the scenes==
