'''Agatha Chubb''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and an expert in ancient wizarding artefacts.<ref name="QTA6"/>

==Biography==
While researching [[Quidditch]] practises of the [[16th century]], she recovered no fewer than twelve lead [[Bludger]]s from marshes and peat bogs in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. She used this discovery to demonstrate how modern [[Wizardkind|wizards]] developed Bludgers from lead and then iron, as lead was determined too soft a metal for the purpose of the balls.<ref name="QTA6">{{QTA|R|6}}</ref>

She wrote, ''"They are undoubtedly Bludgers rather than cannon balls. The faint indentations of magically reinforced [[Beater]]s' [[Beater's bat|bats]] are visible and one can see the distinctive hallmarks of manufacture by a wizard (as opposed to a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]) - the smoothness of line, the perfect symmetry. A final clue was the fact that each and every one of them whizzed around my study and attempted to knock me to the floor when released from its case."''<ref name="QTA6"/>

==Etymology==
"Agatha" is a Latinized form of the Greek name Αγαθη (''Agathe''), derived from Greek αγαθος (''agathos'') meaning "good". Saint Agatha was a 3rd-century martyr from Sicily who was tortured and killed after spurning the advances of a Roman official. The saint was widely revered in the Middle Ages, and her name has been used throughout Christian Europe (in various spellings). The mystery writer Agatha Christie (1890–1976) was a famous modern bearer of this name.
