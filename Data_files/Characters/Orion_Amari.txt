==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|Orion Amari is the enigmastic captain of your house Quidditch team. His training methods may be unorthodox, but his leadership is unparalleled.|Orion's character description|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
*He is in whichever house the player chose for [[Jacob's sibling]].
*His year is not shown in the friends section, similar to [[Skye Parkin]] and [[Murphy McNully]].
*His name could be based on Orion's Belt, which may explain his personality being spiritually aligned.
*He labels his pep talks as "vivifications" &ndash; a play on Rastafarianism's livication terminology, which means dedication without connotation of death.
*He shares his first name with [[Orion Black]], father of [[Sirius Black]].
