}}'''Pythagoras''' was an [[alchemy|alchemist]] whose alchemical advice was referenced in a block of text featured on the back cover of the book ''[[The Decline of Pagan Magic]]''.<ref name="HPVA">{{HPV|A}} {{See image|File:TheDeclineOfPaganMagic.png}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This character is referenced in a block of text on the back cover of a prop book featured in {{DH|F1}}. The text in question was taken from an [[1889]] English translation of the [[French]] book ''Le livre des figures hiéroglyphiques'' (''The Book of Hieroglyphic Figures''), which was first published in [[1612]], and has been attributed to [[Nicolas Flamel]] (c. [[1330]] – [[1418]]).<ref>''[https://archive.org/stream/b24887092#page/18/mode/2up Nicholas Flammel: His Exposition of the Hieroglyphical Figures...]'' copy on the Internet Archive</ref><ref name="wiki1">{{wikilink|Nicolas Flamel}}</ref>
*The historical figure referenced in the block of text is most likely the [[Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher and mathematician {{w|Pythagoras|Pythagoras of Samos}}.<ref name="wiki2">{{wikilink|Pythagoras}}</ref> His teachings developed into a philosophical movement known as {{w|Pythagoreanism}}, which has been regarded as influencing later esoteric disciplines and philosophies, including alchemy.<ref name="wiki3">{{wikilink|Pythagoreanism}}</ref>
*Since his works are mentioned in a [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] book, it is possible Pythagoras also was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], unbeknownst to our modern Muggle community, but this has not been officially confirmed in canon.
