{{Quote|She's passed. Yes, she's gone.|[[Sybill Trelawney]] announcing Camelia's death at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2}}
'''Camelia'''<ref name="name">https://www.mandy.com/uk/actor/sangeeta-reding</ref> (d. [[2 May]], [[1998]])<ref name="DHP2" /> was a [[wizardkind|witch]] who taught at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], having possibly once been a student there as a member of [[Horace Slughorn]]'s [[Slug Club]].<ref name="HBP" />

In [[1994]], she attended the [[Welcoming Feast]] held for the arrival of [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] and [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]], as well as the [[Yule Ball]].<ref name="GOF" /> Her lessons were presumably evaluated by [[Dolores Umbridge]] the following year, during which she sat by [[Sybill Trelawney]] at the [[Start-of-Term Feast]].<ref name="OTP" /> She later attended the [[Slug Club Christmas party]] in [[1996]].<ref name="HBP" />

After fighting in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], Camelia was killed by an unknown [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], [[Snatchers|Snatcher]], or other servant of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. Trelawney and [[Padma Patil]] apparently brought her body in.<ref name="DHP2" />

==Biography==
===Early life===
Camelia was born no later than [[1977]]<ref name="Birth" /> somewhere in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]] to at least one parent of [[wizardkind]].<ref name="Blood" />

It is possible that she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as a member of [[Potions Master]] [[Horace Slughorn]]'s [[Slug Club]].<ref name="HBP" /> She presumably attained high marks in one particular [[Hogwarts subjects|subject]].

After leaving school, she got married.<ref name="Married" /> She was married by [[September]], [[1994]].<ref name="GOF" />

===Career at Hogwarts===
====1994–1995 school year====
{{Quote|When all the students had entered the Hall and settled down at their house tables, the staff entered, filing up to the top table and taking their seats.|The [[1994]] [[Start-of-Term Feast]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[File:Teacher and books.png|250px|thumb|left|Camelia at the [[Start-of-Term Feast]]]]
Camelia was teaching at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] by [[1994]]. She attended the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] at the beginning of the [[1994–1995 school year]].<ref name="GOF" />

Later, Camelia watched the delegations from [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] and [[Durmstrang Institute]] arrive at [[Hogwarts Castle]] for the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. After they arrived, she and the rest of the staff made their way to the [[Great Hall]] for the [[Welcoming Feast]], during which she spent some of her time writing in [[Unidentified female Hogwarts teacher's book|a book]]. She watched the foreign students with interest, and smiled warmly when [[Albus Dumbledore]] greeted [[Igor Karkaroff]] as a friend.<ref name="GOF" />

On [[31 October]], she watched the [[Goblet of Fire]] select [[Fleur Delacour]] and [[Viktor Krum]] become champions of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang respectively, and then [[Cedric Diggory]] and [[Harry Potter]] both become champions of Hogwarts. She did not seem quite as confused as her colleagues following the fourth champion's selection.<ref name="GOF" />

Later on in the year, shortly before [[Christmas]], Camelia oversaw a study session in the [[Great Hall]], as did several other colleagues, including [[Severus Snape]], who she apparently disliked.<ref name="HBP" /> It is possible that she did this in addition to her teaching duties.<ref name="GOF" />

[[File:Unidentified female professor.jpg|250px|thumb|Camelia as a [[Yule Ball]] attendee]]
At [[Christmas]], Camelia attended the [[Yule Ball]] and stood by Professor Dumbledore, [[Minerva McGonagall]], [[Severus Snape]], [[Igor Karkaroff]], and [[Igor Karkaroff's Yule Ball partner|a fellow colleague]]. As the four champions opened the dance. She smiled when Dumbledore took to the floor with McGonagall.<ref name="GOF" />

Later in the year, she watched the Second Task of the Tournament, which [[Harry Potter]] and [[Cedric Diggory]] came in first and second respectively.<ref name="GOF" />

====1995–1996 school year====
{{Quote|Dumbledore clapped. The staff followed his lead, though Harry noticed that several of them brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping.|Hogwarts staff clapping Umbridge's speech at the [[1995]] [[Start-of-Term Feast]]|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[File:Welcoming feast 1996.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Camelia at the welcoming feast sitting next to Trelawney]]
During the [[1995–1996 school year]], Camelia once again attended the [[Start-of-Term Feast]], sitting by [[Unidentified Hogwarts employees#Black 1995 Start-of-Term Feast attendee|a black wizard]] and [[Sybill Trelawney]]. She listened with interest to [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s speech, despite being distracted by Trelawney's appalling table manners.<ref name="Manners">Deleted scene from {{OOTP|F}}</ref> Though some of the staff "''brought their hands together only once or twice before stopping''", the Professor did not clap at all.<ref name="Manners" />

That year, Camelia's classes were presumably inspected by Umbridge following her employment as [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]]. If so, Umbridge must have believed that she was a competent teacher, as she was not suspended.<ref name="OTP" />

====1996–1997 school year====
[[File:Library 1996.jpg|250px|thumb|Camelia leaving the [[Hogwarts Library|library]]]]
Once again, Camelia watched the [[Sorting ceremony|sorting]] of the [[first year]]s in [[1996]]. She sat on Professor Dumbledore's left-hand side, next to [[Rubeus Hagrid]].<ref name="HBP" />

When Dumbledore announced [[Horace Slughorn]]'s reinstatement as [[Potions Master]], she applauded merrily and smiled at him. However, she did not applaud when [[Severus Snape]] was declared [[Professor]] of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]].<ref name="HBP" />

Shortly before [[Christmas]], Camelia went to the [[Hogwarts Library]], looking for books, scanning the shelves while walking down the aisle. After only a fraction of a minute, she had found the books she needed and left the library with the books [[levitation|levitating]] after her.<ref name="HBP" />

[[File:Slug_Club_party.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Camelia arm-in-arm with a wizard at the [[Slug Club Christmas party]]]]
Weeks later, Camelia attended the [[Slug Club Christmas party]] held by her apparent friend and colleague, [[Horace Slughorn]]. She was arm-in-arm with a white-haired wizard when [[Argus Filch]] interrupted the party, dragging [[Draco Malfoy]] with him. After Snape led him out, the Professor carried on with the party and smiled to [[Flora Carrow|Flora]] and [[Hestia Carrow]].<ref name="HBP" />

After the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], Camelia raised her wand along with the other Professors and students to show respect for Albus Dumbledore and to vanquish the Dark Mark.

====1997–1998 school year====
Camelia apparently continued to teach at Hogwarts during the [[1997–1998 school year]], during which [[Severus Snape]], whom she appeared not to like, was made [[Headmaster]] following the [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|Death Eater coup]] over the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]].

On [[1 May]], [[Harry Potter]] arrived in the Castle to destroy one of Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es, but the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] began soon after. Camelia appeared behind Harry looking frightened. She helped defend [[Hogwarts Castle]], partaking in the fighting.<ref name="DHP2" />

At some point before [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] temporarily called back his forces, Camelia was killed, presumably by means of the [[Killing Curse]], as she showed no signs of external injury. Her body was brought to the [[Great Hall]], where [[Sybill Trelawney]], assisted by [[Padma Patil]], covered her corpse with a sheet.<ref name="DHP2" />

==Physical description==
Camelia was a tall witch with white skin, brown eyes, and brown hair. She appeared to have a fondness for the colour red during social occasions, such as the [[Yule Ball]]<ref name="GOF" /> and the [[Slug Club Christmas party]],<ref name="HBP" /> and black for everyday school-wear.<ref name="OTP" /> She normally had her hair out with a plait but sometimes had it in other hairstyles.

==Personality and traits==
[[File:Professor.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Camelia]]
Camelia was an intelligent person, as shown when she appeared to decode [[Dolores Umbridge]]'s cryptic speech and refused to clap for her.<ref name="OTP" /> She also may have had a dislike, or a neutral opinion, for [[Severus Snape]], not applauding his employment as [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, while happily clapping and smiling for [[Horace Slughorn]]'s return.<ref name="HBP" />

Her soft side showed when Dumbledore embraced [[Igor Karkaroff]], smiling warmly,<ref name="GOF" /> and when she went arm-in-arm with a white-haired wizard during the Christmas party.<ref name="HBP" /> She may have also been bookish, as she wrote in [[Unidentified female Hogwarts teacher's book|a book]] instead of watching some of [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] and [[Durmstrang Institute|Durmstrang]]'s students rehearsed entrances,<ref name="GOF" /> and when she visited the library during [[1996]].<ref name="HBP" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Following the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]] and the death of [[Albus Dumbledore]], Camelia raised her [[wand]] into the sky to banish the [[Morsmordre|conjured]] [[Dark Mark]] with a [[Dark Mark counter-curse|counter-curse]].<ref name="HBP"/>
*'''[[Duelling]]''': She had some duelling skills, as she fought bravely in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], willing to defend it from Lord Voldemort and his army, but unfortunately she was killed during combat.<ref name="DHP2" />

==Relationships==
===Hogwarts staff===
[[File:Female teacher2.PNG|209x209px|thumb|left|Camelia with Dumbledore at the [[Yule Ball]]]]
Camelia appeared to have a good relationship with the [[Headmaster]], [[Albus Dumbledore]]. She stood beside him during the [[Yule Ball]], and grinned to herself when he took to the floor with [[Minerva McGonagall]].<ref name="GOF" /> She also sat by him during the [[1996–1997 school year]] [[Start-of-Term Feast]].<ref name="HBP" />

She also seemed to be friendly with [[Horace Slughorn]], [[Potions Master]] and [[Head of Slytherin House]]. She applauded happily (which was a rarity in itself) for him after he took his old job back, and attended his [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]].<ref name="HBP" />

Camelia may also have had a relationship of sorts with [[Sybill Trelawney]], a [[Seer]] and [[Divination (class)|Divination]] [[professor|teacher]]. She sat by her during the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] of [[1995]],<ref name="OTP" /> and Trelawney was the one that tended to her dead body during the hour-long break during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name="DHP2" />

However, she seemed to be unfriendly with and [[Dolores Umbridge]], whom she did not clap for during her announcement of becoming [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher,<ref name="OTP" /><ref name="HBP" /> despite applauding for Professor Slughorn. She might have had a neutral opinion of [[Severus Snape]]. She did not clap for him when he became Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, however she was shortly seen deliberately moving towards him during the [[Yule Ball]], and then stood next to him without any visible discomfort, although she most likely disliked him after the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower|death of Albus Dumbledore]].

Slytherin members also had some sort of relationship with her, as she smiled at [[Flora and Hestia Carrow]] at the Slug Club Christmas party. Camelia also seemed to like Horace Slughorn because once she clapped for him but refused to clap for anyone else.

==Behind the scenes==
