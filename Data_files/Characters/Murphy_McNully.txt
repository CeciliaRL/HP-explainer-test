{{Quote|Murphy McNully, by the way. The wizarding world's next best-ever professional Quidditch commentator. That's the plan, at least. Judging by the competition, I'd put my odds of going pro at 3-1.|Murphy McNully introduces himself to [[Jacob's sibling]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
'''Murphy McNully''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1980s]] and was a [[Quidditch Commentator]].<ref name="HM"/> He was the inventor of the Quidditch strategy [[Thimblerig Shuffle]].

==Biography==
[[File:Murphy McNully promo.png|thumb|left|Murphy commentating during a game of Quidditch]]
When Murphy was seven years old, his mother taught him the [[Blackboard Writing Spell]].<ref name="HMQ4">{{HM|2|Q1|4}}</ref> Murphy had been subscribed to ''[[Which Broomstick?]]'' ever since he could read.<ref name="Comet">{{HM|2|Q1|9}}</ref>

Murphy McNully was a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1980]]s. He was physically disabled and immobile, and thus required the use of [[Wheelchair]] for locomotion. He was a [[Quidditch]] fanatic who would go so far as to commentate on Hogwarts' Quidditch friendlies, practise matches that required no commentator.<ref name="HM">{{HM|2|Q1}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Murphy loved Quidditch, and had always wanted to be an announcer. He also immensely enjoyed talking. Due to his using a wheelchair, when meeting new people, he tried to display every aspect of his personality so they would not remember him as just "the wizard in the wheelchair". Murphy had a very charming personality, and was a skilled strategist.

His favourite food was sandwiches.{{Fact}}

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Murphy was taught the [[Blackboard writing spell]] by his [[Murphy McNully's mother|mother]], and was proficient with the casting of this enchantment himself.
*'''[[Quidditch]] Knowledge''': Murphy was knowledgeable about [[Quidditch]] and Quidditch strategies. He was an entertaining Quidditch commentator, and was also an avid user of statistics, at the time when the sports only had the basics.
*'''[[Wizard's Chess]]''': Murphy was quite skilled at wizard's chess, frequently beating Jacob's sibling at it.{{Fact}}

==Possessions==
*'''[[Wand]]''': Murphy owned a wand, which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood|wood]] and [[wand core|core]], which he presumably purchased before his [[first year]] at Hogwarts.
*'''[[Wheelchair]]''': Being physically disabled and unable to walk, Murphy owned and operated a wheelchair for movement.
*'''[[Kneazle]]''': Murphy owned a pet Kneazle named [[Kneil]].

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|Murphy McNully, McNully to his friends, aims to be the greatest Quidditch commentor in history. His mind for statistics and keen understanding of strategy are invaluable to any novice Quidditch player.|Murphy's character description|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
*He is in whichever house the player chose for [[Jacob's sibling]].
*His year is not shown in the friends section, similar to [[Skye Parkin]] and [[Orion Amari]].
*His favourite colour is either green, blue, red or yellow, depending on which house he is sorted into.
*During the team meeting before the second house cup final, he will say "Don't think about where the [[Quaffle]] is, think about where it will be." This is very similar to the advice that {{w|Walter Gretzky}} famously gave his son, {{w|Canadian}} {{w|ice hockey}} icon {{w|Wayne Gretzky}}, about skating towards where the hockey puck will be, while training his son to play the game as a boy. Wayne would later credit his great success as an adult to such insights.
