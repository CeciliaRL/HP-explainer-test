'''Arcadinho''' was a local [[wizardkind|wizard]] guide to [[Brazil]]ian jungles.<ref name="WhereAngelsDare"/>

==History==
At some point during the [[Calamity]], a [[Calamity Investigator]] serving as part of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic's]] [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] travelled to the jungles of Brazil in search of pure [[Angel's Trumpet]] with which they could brew [[Tonic for Trace Detection]]. After discovering a massive supply, they coordinated an export strategy with Arcadinho.<ref name="WhereAngelsDare"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*The Portuguese word "arcadinho" is the masculine singular diminutive noun form of "árcade", referring to a member of the [[Wikipedia:pt:Arcádia Lusitana|Arcádia Lusitana]], an 18th-century literary society (modelled after the Italian [[Wikipedia:Pontifical Academy of Arcadia|Accademia dell'Arcadia]]) that introduced [[Wikipedia:Neoclassicism|Neoclassicism]] to the possessions of the Portuguese Empire (which included [[Brazil]]).
