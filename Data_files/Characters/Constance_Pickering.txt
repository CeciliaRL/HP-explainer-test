{{Quote|This Calamity is, well, quite calamitous. Everything that anyone has ever feared, revered, or held dear in the [[wizarding world]] — people, things, even [[Memory|memories]] — have been stolen and displaced, tossed about across the world. We've got to return what is lost, and quickly.

'''Constance Pickering''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who worked for the [[British Ministry of Magic]], and was the leader of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]] to parents (one of whom was at least magical) around the dawn of the [[20th century]].<ref name="blood"/>

Her grandfather, [[Matthias Pickering]], was a cruel and greedy wizard who would turn violent whenever Constance, angered him, which was often. Despite that, Constance's parents always sided with him. He was wealthy and knew a lot of powerful witches and wizards, so [[Pickering family]] always did whatever they could to keep him happy. He opened Constance's eyes to all the injustice in the [[wizarding world]]. <ref name="WUCL">{{WU}} "[[Brilliant Event: Constance's Lament]]"</ref>

As a child, she lived next door to a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] girl, [[Silvia]]. Constance convinced her that "[[Knarl|hedgehogs]]" loved it when you left them snacks overnight. Silvia left out a plate and and the next day her garden was destroyed, leaving Constance feeling guilty.<ref name="BabyBeasts"/>

She once had a [[Crup]] named [[Ross]], but her family had to give him away when Constance's brother turned out to be a [[squib]], and Ross just wouldn't stop nipping his bum, which scarred him for life.<ref name="BabyBeasts"/>

When Constance was a girl, her family took her to a [[Norwegian Dragon Sanctuary|Dragon sanctuary]] in [[Norway]]. They got to see the baby [[dragon]]s up close and one of them bit Constance's finger, which hurt for a month.<ref name="BabyBeasts"/>

Constance always thought [[Christmas cracker]]s looked like loads of fun when her [[Constance Pickering's mother|mother]] and [[Constance Pickering's sister|sister]] pulled them together. The pop always made her squeal with delight. But they were never able to have a tree at they house. Constance's mum said she was “allergic” to decorating. Therefore Constance loved looking in their neighbours' windows and seeing their trees, all bright and shiny.<ref name="ChristmasCalamity"/>

When Constance was ten years old, her [[Constance Pickering's grandmother|grandmother]] came over for Christmas. She wore a [[badger]] brooch that Constance pilfered to play with. As punishment, Constance spent the rest of Christmas locked in the attic.<ref name="ChristmasCalamity"/>

As a little girl, Constance used to adore vintage circus posters. However, during a wave of the [[Calamity]] focusing on the [[Circus Arcanus]], she finally saw the old-time circus up close and lost the desire to go to one. She also hated clowns.<ref name = "CircusCalamitous">{{WU}} "Brilliant Event: Circus Calamitous"</ref>

===Hogwarts years===
Constance displayed signs of [[magic]]al ability at some point in her early childhood and was subsequently admitted to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], which issued her a [[Hogwarts Acceptance letter|letter of acceptance]] on her eleventh birthday. Her [[Constance Pickering's mother|mother]] wouldn't buy her a new [[cauldron]]. She gave Constance [[Constance Pickering's brother (II)|her brother]]'s old, used one and bought him a new one.<ref name="FirstYearAtHogwarts"/> She later boarded the [[Hogwarts Express]] from [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|Platform 9¾]] at [[King's Cross Station]] in order to embark on her first year of magical education.

At the time of her attendance, which began no earlier than [[September]] [[1998]], the school was under the firm stewardship of [[Professor]] [[Minerva McGonagall]]. Also she never met [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]], but always thought she would have been a perfect candidate for the "[[Slug Club]]".<ref name="FirstYearAtHogwarts"/> She was Sorted into [[Hufflepuff]].<ref name="TriwizardingSecrets"/> Throughout her childhood, she heard stories about the [[Death Eaters]] that the school's inspirational [[Hogwarts Headmaster|Headmistress]] and her allies had fought against at the legendary [[Battle of Hogwarts]], and found the group to be terrifying.<ref>{{WU}} "Brilliant Event: Fighting Forces"</ref>

As a student, one of her favourite things about school life was the [[Christmas]] [[Christmas Feast|celebration]] at the [[Hogwarts Castle]], and would later go on to leave the school with many fond memories about spending the [[Christmas holidays|holidays]] at the school; marvelling at the pudding, the baubles, the trees and the fairy lights. At some point, she also learned that there had been a [[Yule Ball]] that took place during the [[Triwizard Tournament]] in [[1994]] and later admitted to having harboured high hopes that the competition would be held once more just so her generation got one of their own.<ref name="ChristmasCalamity"/>

Constance loathed ''[[The Monster Book of Monsters]]'', because her copy bit her once.<ref name="FirstYearAtHogwarts"/>

She was never quite as adept at [[Charms (class)|Charms]] as she would have liked. She failed in Charms, and never really got over it. They had a parent's meeting which included [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall]]. It was awful, and Constance spent the time between classes practising various [[charm]]s on her pet [[newt]], [[Nevin]].<ref name="FirstYearAtHogwarts"/>

In her [[fifth year]], Constance became the [[Hufflepuff]] female [[Prefect]]. She was thrilled that she be able to use the [[Prefects' Bathroom]]. Constance spent the whole summer leading up to her fifth year dreaming of the long, luxurious soaks she take come [[September]]. Unfortunately, she found it impossible to relax with a [[portrait of a mermaid]] staring at her the whole time. After that day, she made sure to only bathe while the mermaid was asleep.<ref name="TriwizardingSecrets"/>

===The Unforgivable===
Constance's grandfather, was a selfish wizard who founded [[The Unforgivable]] to make himself rich and powerful. He recruited only wealthy and influential wizards with the promise of more money and power. They did terrible things to get ahead with no concern for anyone but themselves. The moment Constance discovered The Unforgivable existed, she decided she could put the organisation and their resources to better use. She decided that she could make a difference and help those truly in need. She made Matthias disappear by hiding him, alive and mostly unharmed, inside the big trunk in her room and with the help of a [[Polyjuice Potion]], took the place of the leader of the organisation.<ref name="WUCL" />

===Career===
Constance almost became a [[Magizoologist]] when she graduated Hogwarts. But she didn't have the stomach for it. One cold night hiding in a bramble bush by a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] field, waiting for a [[Mooncalf]] to do its dance was all it took. Constance was out looking for a new post by morning.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

====Working for the Ministry====
[[File:HPWU_BE_Stronger_United_-_Constance_Pickering.png|125px|thumb|Constance as a Ministry employee]]
Seeing her as an icon, there was nothing Constance wanted more upon graduating from Hogwarts than the chance to work with [[Hermione Granger]], a high-ranking official in the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] and famously progressive voice that had played no small part in the eradication of oppressive, [[Pure-blood supremacy|pro-pureblood]] laws following her death-defying participation in the legendary [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. As such, when she applied for the position as a [[Junior Undersecretary]] in the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], where her hero worked, Constance discreetly slipped her application into the pile that she knew Mrs Granger would draw her future assistant from, and to her delight found herself picked for the job.<ref>{{WU}} (See this [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/719973259222843473/722494738804244550/SOS_-_All_in_One_SECRET.PNG image])</ref>

====The Calamity====
In the [[2010s]], during the series of large-scale breaches of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] that became known as [[Calamity|The Calamity]], the [[British Ministry of Magic]] and the [[International Confederation of Wizards]] worked together to set up an [[International Task Force]] whose job it would be to track down and contain the chaotic outbreaks of [[magic]] from being noticed by [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]. To this end, Ms Pickering was asked by [[Hermione Granger]] upon its sanction to set up what would become known as the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]].<ref>{{WU}} {{see image|File:WU trailer documents ref.png}}</ref> At some point, presumably in her capacity as the leader of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]], she verified the casting of a [[Muggle-Repelling Charm]] over an undisclosed object or location.<ref>{{WU}} {{see image|File:RepelloMuggletumConstance.png}}</ref> She was also the one who suggested using banners to identify areas of high concentration of [[Foundable]]s that seemed to be somehow related to one another, at which point her boyfriend, [[Lucas Sparrowvale]], proceeded to spend no less than six months travelling the world and placing them.<ref>{{WU}} "Brilliant Event: One Year Later Cup"</ref>

In [[2019]], the [[Pickering family]] had Christmas at the new house of Constance's sister, but for some reason, they did not send Constance any details or address. As a result, Constance was invited to have Christmas dinner with the [[Potter family]].<ref name="ChristmasCalamity"/>

One day, Constance was set on becoming an [[Animagus]]. She kept a [[mandrake leaf]] in her mouth for a month, brewed [[Animagus potion|the potion]], and was just waiting for a [[Electricity|lightning storm]] when [[Sloan Travers]] told her about a friend of a friend who botched [[Animagus Spell|the spell]] and became half wizard, half {{w|naked mole-rat}}. Unsure that her [[silver]] teaspoon of [[Morning dew|dew]] hadn't seen sunlight or been touched by human feet for seven or six days and terrified of becoming a half-human half-animal abomination, Constance never drank the potion.<ref name="TNM">{{WU}}, [[Brilliant Event: The New Marauders]]</ref>
{{Expand|Section needs to include her further developments and arrest.}}

==Magical abilities and skills==
An accomplished witch, Constance Pickering became an important member of the [[Calamity Management Team]] and was eventually tasked with heading up the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]], whose job it was to investigate and contain the outbreaks of chaotic magic unleashed by the [[Calamity]], showing the trust that the Ministry had in her abilities, both as a leader and where her magical prowess was concerned.

*'''[[Duelling]]''': Constance possessed a level of skill in magical combat and with [[martial magic]], as she was able to duel against members of [[The Unforgivable]] seemingly proficiently.<ref name="AWP">{{WU}} - [[Brilliant Event: A Weasley Predicament]]</ref>

*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Constance once intended to become an [[Animagus]], implying she was skilled enough in the field of transfiguration.<ref name="TNM"/>
*[[Legilimency]]: Constance used the Legilimency to rule The Unforgivable.<ref name="WUCL" />
