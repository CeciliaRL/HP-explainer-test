This '''unnamed [[Greece|Greek]] man''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who met [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in the [[Leaky Cauldron]] in [[1990]].

==Biography==
He sold Hagrid the [[Fluffy|three-headed dog]] he owned. Hagrid named this dog [[Fluffy]], and, the [[1991|following year]], lent him to [[Albus Dumbledore]], who used him to guard the [[Philosopher's Stone]]<ref name="PS11">{{PS|B|11}}</ref>on the [[Third-floor corridor]].

==Behind the scenes==

*In {{PS|FA}}, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] states that he bought [[Fluffy]] from "an [[Ireland|Irish]] feller", rather than "a Greek chappie," as he does in the book. This change loses [[J. K. Rowling]]'s reference to [[Wikipedia:Greek mythology|Greek mythology]], in which there was a three-head dog, [[Wikipedia:Cerberus|Cerberus]], that guarded the gates of [[Wikipedia:Hades|Hades]]. [[Steve Kloves]], the film's screenwriter, stated that he originally used "a Greek chappie," but did not know how the line got changed.<sup><ref>[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/ps/rg-ps11.html Reader's Guide to Chapter 11 of ''Philosopher's Stone''] on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref></sup>
