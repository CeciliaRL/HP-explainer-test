'''Mason Tremblay''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] that resided in the part-wizarding village of [[Appleby]] in North Lincolnshire,Â [[England]], and was at one point suspected of having been a [[Death Eaters]] in the service of [[Lord Voldemort]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>

==Biography==
At some point in his life, Tremblay was suspected to have been a follower of Lord Voldemort. By at least the 2010s, Tremblay had established a home for himself in [[Appleby]] and had grown into old age. However, Tremblay eventually went mad, attacking local [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] throughout the community. A [[Calamity Investigator]] serving as part of the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic's]] [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] was able to stop his vicious rampage, but not before Tremblay could do an extensive amount of irreparable damage.<ref name="WU"/>
