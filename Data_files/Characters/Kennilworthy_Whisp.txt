'''Kennilworthy Whisp''' was an [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], author and [[Quidditch]] expert/fanatic, known for having written a number of [[Quidditch]]-related works, including the best-selling book {{QTA}}. Whisp resided in [[Nottinghamshire]] in [[England]], and divided his time between his home and "wherever the [[Wigtown Wanderers]] were playing". His hobbies included playing [[backgammon]], [[vegetarian cookery]], and collecting vintage [[broomstick]]s.<ref name="QTAR">{{QTA|R}}</ref> Despite liking vegetarian cookery, he was not a vegetarian.<ref name="JKRtwitter">[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/975836694858616834 @tylorstarr: Do you think Newt and Kennilworthy are friends? And if so, do they sit around making vegetarian dishes for each other? @jk_rowling: No, I don't think Newt and Kennilworthy would be friends at all. *Very* different kinds of people (and Kennilworthy would definitely eat steak.)] by [https://twitter.com/jk_rowling J.K. Rowling on Twitter]</ref>
