==Biography==
At some point in her career, she entered the [[Love Chamber]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]]; the log documenting the time of her entry and exit was brought to light during the investigation over the [[Calamity]], as it also showed [[Grim Fawley]] was frequently in the room at odd times.<ref name="WUtrailer"/>
