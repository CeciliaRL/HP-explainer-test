'''Jodie Pritchard''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who was wrongly credited as having authored the book ''[[The Philosophy of the Mundane: Why the Muggles Prefer Not to Know]]'',<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:PhilosophyOfTheMundane.png|this image]])</ref> which was authored by [[Professor]] [[Mordicus Egg]].

Alternatively, Jodie Pritchard might just have been the publisher of the [[1992]] version of the book.
