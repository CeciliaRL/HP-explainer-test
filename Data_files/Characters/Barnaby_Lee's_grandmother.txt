The '''grandmother''' of [[Barnaby Lee]] (whom he called his "grandmum") was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who owned a collection of [[Dark Arts|Dark]] Artefacts. Since she never bought him toys as a child, Barnaby used to play with her artefacts instead. She also owned a [[crup]], although her grandson suspected she only did to scare [[Non-magic people|Muggles]].<ref name="HM">{{HM}}</ref>
