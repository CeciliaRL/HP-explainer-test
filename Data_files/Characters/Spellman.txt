==Etymology==
"''Spellman''" is English name derived of "''Speller''". "''Speller''" : 1. a person who spells words in the manner specified & 2. (Social Science / Education) a book designed to teach or improve spelling. The name has a sort of double meaning. Spell is the name of a general magical action, so it could, additionally, mean: a person who practises spells.

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that Spellman is just a pen name of Rosana Amorin.
*It is possible that Spellman is based on Sabrina Spellman. J.K. RowlingÂ may have added her in just like she did with other magical characters, such as Merlin.
