[[File:Mildred engagement ring.gif|200px|thumb|left|Mildred breaking up with Jacob]]
While little is known about Mildred's personality, it can be assumed she was very money-oriented and selfish, and that she did not genuinely [[love]] [[Jacob Kowalski]] whilst engaged to him, as she immediately broke off their engagement when he failed to get a bank loan, showing she only really appeared to be interested in the financial side of their relationship.<ref name="CB"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Mildred was portrayed by [[Sinead Matthews]] in ''[[Fantastic Beasts (film series)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''.<ref name="snitchseeker">[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-film-casts-two-new-actresses-in-roles-101804/ 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' film casts two new actresses in roles] from SnitchSeeker.com</ref> Her role was cut from the final version, but her scenes were included in the film's deleted scenes.
**The scene had Jacob returning from the bank to [[435 Rivington Street|435]] [[Rivington Street]] to find his fiancée waiting for him. Mildred runs to Jacob and asks how did it go and if he got the loan. He says that the bank did not give it to him, and she takes off their engagement ring and leaves him.<ref name="youtube">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3D_0YBpyMs/ Fantastic Beasts DELETED SCENES + Fantastic Beasts 2 Theories] at YouTube</ref>
