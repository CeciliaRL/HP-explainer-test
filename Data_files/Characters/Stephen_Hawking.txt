==Biography==

When [[Harry Potter]] arrived at [[Leaky Cauldron|The Leaky Cauldron]] after fleeing the [[Dursley family|Dursley]] [[4 Privet Drive|house]] after letting his [[Marjorie Dursley|Aunt]] fly away in [[1993]], there was a [[Wizard in the Leaky Cauldron|wizard]] sitting at a table reading ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'', a best-selling popular science book written by Hawking.<ref name="poa-film" />

At the time of this book's publication, Hawking had been living with [[Lou Gehrig's disease]] for over twenty years, requiring him to use a [[wheelchair]].<ref name="poa-film" />

Coincidentally, Hawking died on the same date (14 March) as Albert Einstein was born, and at the same age (76) at which Einstein died.

==Etymology==
The name "Stephen" comes from the Greek name Στεφανος (Stephanos) meaning "crown".
