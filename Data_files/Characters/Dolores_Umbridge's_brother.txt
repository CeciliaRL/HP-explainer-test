==Biography==
Umbridge was born in [[1973]] or earlier to the [[Wizardkind|wizard]] [[Orford Umbridge]] and [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Ellen Cracknell]], and had an older sister named [[Dolores Umbridge|Dolores]]. His status as a [[Squib]] would often lead his [[Orford Umbridge|father]] and sister to blame his [[Ellen Cracknell|mother]] for being the cause of it, which led the [[Umbridge family|family]] to be fraught with tensions. When Dolores was fifteen years old, his parents separated and he would return to the [[Muggle world]] with his mother, while his sister would stay with his father in the [[wizarding world]] and would never speak of him again.<ref name="PM"/>
