The phrase "within age" was interpreted by jurist Sir Edward Coke as meaning the age of marriage, which at the time was 12 years of age. A 1576 law making it a felony to "unlawfully and carnally know and abuse any woman child under the age of 10 years" was generally interpreted as creating more severe punishments when girls were under 10 years old while retaining the lesser punishment for acts with 10- and 11-year-old girls. Jurist Sir Matthew Hale argued that the age of consent applied to 10- and 11-year-old girls, but most of England's North American colonies adopted the younger age. Per this information, Rionach could have been as young as twelve - the "age of consent" per the law in 1576 - at the time her daughter was born in 1603.</ref><br/>[[Ireland]]<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|ilvermorny}}</ref>

{{Quote|Before her death, Rionach would help Muggle neighbours with magical cures for humans and livestock, alongside her husband William. Isolt would honour her late mother by naming her daughter after her.|Rionach's kindness towards Muggles|Pottermore}}
'''Rionach Sayre''' (née '''Gaunt''') (d. [[1608]]) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]]. She was the wife of [[William Sayre]] and the mother of [[Isolt Sayre]]. Isolt was one of the founders of [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Rionach was sympathetic towards her [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours and because of this she was murdered by her prejudiced sister [[Gormlaith Gaunt]].<ref name="Pottermore" />

==Biography==
Rionach was a descendant of [[Salazar Slytherin]], one of the founders of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She was born into the [[Ireland|Irish]] branch of the [[House of Gaunt|Gaunt family]]. By [[1603]], she had married a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], [[William Sayre]], and was living at [[Ilvermorny Cottage]] in [[Coomloughra]], [[County Kerry]], Ireland. Their daughter, [[Isolt Sayre|Isolt]], was born that year.<ref name="Pottermore" />

She and her husband [[love]]d their daughter very much and were quietly helpful to their [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours, producing [[magic]]al cures for [[human]]s and livestock alike. She did not seem to share her family's belief in their [[pure-blood supremacy]].<ref name="Pottermore" />

However, when Isolt was five, William and Rionach were killed in a [[fire]] started by her estranged and deranged sister, [[Gormlaith Gaunt]], a malevolent [[Dark Wizard|Dark witch]] who "saved" Isolt with the intention of raising her with a belief in [[pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood superiority]]. Isolt eventually fled Gormlaith and moved to the [[United States of America|New World]] where she befriended a [[Pukwudgie]] who she named [[William (Pukwudgie)|William]] in honour of her father. Rionach had two granddaughters through Isolt's marriage to [[James Steward]], [[Martha Steward II|Martha]] and [[Rionach Steward]], as well as two grandsons by adoption, [[Chadwick Boot|Chadwick]] and [[Webster Boot]].<ref name="Pottermore" />

==Personality and traits==
Rionach was evidently a very kind-hearted and compassionate witch, who [[love]]d her daughter and husband dearly, and cared immensely for the well-being of others. She was known to be very tolerant towards [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], as she often helped them using [[magic]], showing despite being a pure-blood, she viewed them as equals to [[Wizardkind]], and was not a [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]], unlike many others, such as her [[Gormlaith Gaunt|sister]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Rionach was proficient in the art of medical magic, as she was capable of producing [[magic]]al cures for the illnesses and health conditions of her [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] neighbours and livestock alive, meaning with [[healing spell]]s, [[potion]]s and other magical remedies.<ref name="Pottermore" />

==Etymology==
*Rionach is a variant of the name Ríoghnach, derived from Irish ríoghan meaning "queen". In Irish legend this was a wife of the Irish king Niall.
*Sayre is a derivative of the pre-medieval personal name ''Saher'' or ''Seir'', which itself is a short form of the Norman name ''Sigiheri'' introduced into England after the Conquest of 1066, and that can be translated as "victory, army". It can also be originated from the medieval occupational name for a wood cutter, ''sayhare'', although the usual surname is now ''Sawyer''. The third orgin is from Middle English ''say(en)'' or ''seycen'', to say, and literally means "professional reciter".The fourth origin is from the medieval occupation of assaying metals or tasting food, derived from the Old French ''essay'', meaning "trial, test"
