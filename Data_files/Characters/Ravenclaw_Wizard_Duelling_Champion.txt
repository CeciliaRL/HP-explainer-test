The '''Ravenclaw Wizard Duelling Champion''' as the title suggests, refers to the duelling champion for the [[Ravenclaw]] house. He is a selected student from the Ravenclaw house to represent the house in the [[Founder Duels]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
This boy attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw|Ravenclaw House]]. His [[Head of House]] was [[Filius Flitwick]], the [[Charm]]s [[Professor]] and [[Choir Master|Frog Choir conductor]], and he shared a dormitory with four boys in his year in the [[Ravenclaw Tower]].

===[[1992–1993 school year]]===
He apparently excelled at [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] and became the [[Ravenclaw]] Duelling Champion. When [[Harry Potter]] defeated him, he gave him [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]'s [[Chocolate Frog Card|card]].
