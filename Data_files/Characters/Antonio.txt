'''Antonio''' was a baby [[Chupacabra]] chained to [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s chair in his cell during his brief imprisonment at the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]] in [[1926]]-[[1927]]. Most notably, it participated in [[Gellert Grindelwald's escape]].<ref name="COG2"/>

==Biography==
Shortly before Grindelwald's attempted [[Gellert Grindelwald's escape|extradition to Europe]], under escort by several [[Auror]]s and [[Rudolph Spielman]] (the [[International Confederation of Wizards]]'s [[Head of Incarceration]]) Grindelwald managed to switch places with MACUSA official [[Abernathy]] using the [[Polyjuice Potion]]. After the [[Incarceration Carriage|high-security flying carriage]] set off from the [[Woolworth Building]], the real Grindelwald [[Apparition|Apparated]] onto the carriage, eliminated all the [[Auror]]s, and destroyed [[Rudolph Spielman]]'s [[Rudolph Spielman's wand|wand]], who - panicking - opened the box that had been handed to him supposedly containing [[Elder Wand|Grindelwald's wand]], only to have Antonio jump up from inside the opened box and sink his fangs deep into Spielman’s neck.<ref name="COG11">{{COG|S|11}}</ref>

Once Grindelwald clambered inside the carriage, he grabbed Antonio from Spielman and rubbed him affectionately; but suddenly, Grindelwald looked at Antonio with distaste and judged the Chupacabra to be "''so needy''", throwing him out the door of the flying carriage.<ref name="COG15">{{COG|S|15}}</ref> It is unknown if Antonio managed to survive the fall or not.
