'''Daniel Radcliffe''' (fl. [[1997]]) was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] actor who had a large part in ''[[Equus]]'', a play that was staged sometime in the late [[1990s]]. There was a poster mentioning him at [[Luchino Caffe]] in the summer of [[1997]].<ref name="DHpt1">{{DH|F1}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This mention is an obvious reference to [[Daniel Radcliffe]], the actor who played [[Harry Potter]] in all the [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' films]] and who also had a part in the 2007 revival of ''[[Wikipedia:Equus (play)|Equus]]''. It was put on the set as a little inside joke.
