After her death in [[1639]], everyone who knew her felt great sorrow.

For this, Gunhilda was featured in a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="COSG"/> A statue of Gunhilda could be found in the [[Gunhilda of Gorsemoor Corridor]] on the third-floor at [[Hogwarts Castle]]. When one tapped the statue's hump with a [[wand]] and casted the opening [[charm]] ''[[Dissendium]]'', a [[One-Eyed Witch Passage|secret passage]] would be opened, leading to the basement of [[Honeydukes|Honeydukes Sweetshop]] in [[Hogsmeade]], which was used by [[Harry Potter]] in the [[1993–1994 school year]]<ref name="POA10">{{POA|B|10}}</ref> and a group of students in the [[2009–2010 school year]].<ref name="MA">{{MA}}</ref>
