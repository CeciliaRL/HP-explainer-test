'''Iola'''<ref name="JKR">[[J. K. Rowling]]'s handdrawn [[House of Black#Black family tree|Black family tree]], retrieved from {{HPFW}} {{see image|File:JKRBlackFamilyTree.jpg}}</ref> '''Hitchens''' (née '''Black''') was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the sister of [[Sirius Black I|Sirius]], [[Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]], and [[Elladora Black]]. She married a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] man named [[Bob Hitchens]], and was struck off the [[House of Black|Black Family tree]] and disowned as a result. Her dates are unknown, but she was born after Elladora ([[1850]]).<ref name="BFT" />

==Behind the scenes==
<!---*Iola was possibly a daughter of [[Cygnus Black I]], and her uncle was [[Arcturus Black I|Arcturus]].--->
*Several sources mistakenly list this character's name as "Isla Black". This seems to stem from an [https://www.hp-lexicon.org/wizards/blackfamilytree.html incorrect transcription of J.K. Rowling's handdrawn family tree] by the [[Harry Potter Lexicon]], based on observation of the original during its auction, on 20 February 2006 (and which was, for a time, the only available source online on the matter). A scan of the original document has since surfaced, having been included in the book {{HPFW}}, a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]]. The scan clarified that Iola's name had been incorrectly transcribed by the Lexicon (indeed, by that point, the name "Iola" had already appeared on the tapestry featured in {{OOTP|FA}}).
*Based on a statement by [[Horace Slughorn]], Iola may have been a member of the [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. However, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] in the 1860s, at a time when Slughorn was not even born yet. 
*However, if she was in Slytherin then she would be a rare example of a "Good Slytherin" due to her non-biased views on blood purity and subsequent marriage to a Muggle. 
*Iola was the second earliest known disowned person in the family. The earliest known was [[Eduardus Limette Black]].

==Etymology==
''Iola'' is probably a female variant of the Ancient Greek name Iole, meaning "violet". In Greek mythology [[Wikipedia:Iole|Iole]] was a beautiful young princess who was claimed by Heracles for a bride, but her father, [[Wikipedia:Eurytus#King Eurytus of Oechalia|King Eurytus of Oechalia]], refused her hand in marriage,<ref name="BTN">[http://www.behindthename.com/name/iola "Iola"] at [http://www.behindthename.com/ Behind the Name]</ref> which seems to suit Iola Black's story of a morganatic marriage and subsequent disowning.
