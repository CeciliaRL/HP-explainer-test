'''Jack Monk''' (b. [[20 May]], [[1995]]<ref name="20May"/>) was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] boy, the son of [[Dave Monk|Dave]] and [[Tilly Monk]], and the twin brother of [[Tom Monk|Tom]].

==Biography==
===Birth and rescue===
Jack Monk and his brother were born prematurely, delivered simultaneously as what their father described as a "bundle," and received immediate medical care from "an amazing neonatal team." After twelve weeks in the [[Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|NICU]], during which time they were kept in incubators, receiving vital fluids through intravenous lines and breathing with the help of mechanical ventilators, the twins were able to go home with their parents. By this time, Jack weighed four pounds, having weighed only one pound, seven ounces at birth.

The twins' father wrote an article about their miraculous birth, which was featured on the front page of the [[12 August]], [[1995]] issue of ''[[Metro]]'', under the title "''Miracle babies make it''".<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE|G}} {{see image|File:Metro.png}}</ref>
