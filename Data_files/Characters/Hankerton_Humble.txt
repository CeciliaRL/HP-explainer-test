'''Hankerton Humble''' was the first ever [[Hogwarts Caretaker|caretaker]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was hired by the [[Hogwarts founders|founders of Hogwarts]] themselves, and began the never-ending caretaker tradition of hating [[Peeves]].<ref name="WW">{{WW|peeves}}</ref>

==Biography==
Hankerton was born sometime in the [[Middle Ages]], presumably in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]] given that Hogwarts only accepts students from there.<ref name="WW"/>

Soon after the founding of Hogwarts, he was accepted as the caretaker there. During his time, he started the everlasting tradition of caretakers' hating [[Peeves]]; it is unknown how he got along with the students, though judging by his name it may have been fairly well. Sometime before [[1876]], however, he had retired and was succeeded (though by how many generations is unknown) by [[Rancorous Carpe]].<ref name="WW"/>

==Etymology==
''Hankerton'' is a town in [[Wiltshire]], known for its ancient church. ''Humble'' means "meek", or "polite", possibly reflecting on his personality. ''Humble'' could also be short for "humblebee" another term for "bumblebee."
