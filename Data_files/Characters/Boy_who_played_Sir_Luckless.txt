{{Quote|Little did [[Herbert Beery|he]] know that the students playing Amata and Sir Luckless had been boyfriend and girlfriend until one hour before the curtain rose, at which point 'Sir Luckless' transferred his affections to 'Asha'.|[[Albus Dumbledore]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}

This '''boy''' attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the early part of the [[20th century]] while [[Armando Dippet]] was headmaster. 

He was cast as [[Sir Luckless]] in the [[Christmas]] production of "[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]" that [[Herbert Beery]], the [[Herbology]] [[Professor]], arranged. An hour before the play started, he dumped the [[Girl who played Amata|girl]] playing [[Amata]] in favour of the one playing [[Asha]], causing the two jealous young witches to [[Duelling|duel]] each other on the stage. Professor Beery was caught in the crossfire and unable to stop them or prevent the [[Engorgement Charm|engorged]] [[ashwinder]], serving as the [[gigantic white worm]], from setting fire to the [[Great Hall]].<ref>{{TBB|F}}</ref>
