'''Abernathy''' (fl. [[1920s]]) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], a former employee of the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]] and eventual follower and [[Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes|acolyte]] of [[Gellert Grindelwald]].

==Biography==
===Career at MACUSA===
[[File:Abernathy FB1.png|150px|thumb|left|Abernathy as supervisor for the Goldsteins]]
In [[1926]], he served as a supervisor to both [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina]]<ref>{{FB|S|10}}</ref> and [[Queenie Goldstein]]<ref>{{FB|S|24}}</ref> in the [[Wand Permit Office]] and was responsible for overseeing their activities and whereabouts. He was unhappy when he found out that Tina had interrupted a meeting held by the Investigative Team again and admonished her. He asked her whether she was investigating the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]] again, but when [[Percival Graves]] showed up, he immediately brightened up and politely said hello.

Later, he questioned Queenie where she was going and what she had in her [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|suitcase]], while she was attempting to transport Tina, [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] and [[Jacob Kowalski]] from the MACUSA building unnoticed. Queenie replied that she was ill and that the luggage contained women's things. When asked if he wanted to take a look, Abernathy immediately and uncomfortably replied that he would not, and wished her to get well.
===Joining the Alliance===
[[File:Grindelwald turns into Abernathy.png|250px|thumb|left|Abernathy in the Incarceration Carriage]]
A few months later, early in [[1927]], Abernathy assisted with the [[Gellert Grindelwald's escape|escape]] of [[Gellert Grindelwald]].<ref>[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2018/08/24/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-full-character-profiles-reveal-trouble-in-paris/ "‘Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald’ Full Character Profiles Reveal Trouble in Paris!"] at The Leaky Cauldron</ref> He helped Grindelwald escape by temporarily switching appearances with the [[Dark Wizard]] using [[Human Transfiguration]], and boarding the [[Incarceration Carriage]] together with a team of [[Auror]]s and [[Rudolph Spielman]]. Grindelwald (still bearing Abernathy's appearance) then [[Apparition|apparated]] onto the carriage, killed the [[Auror]]s, sent Spielman flying down from the carriage (although he survived thanks to a [[Slowing Charm]]), and [[Conjuration|conjured]] Abernathy (now restored to his true appearance) a new tongue, while Abernathy gave Grindelwald the salvaged [[blood pact]] vial. The two rogue wizards then flew away to [[Europe]], probably to [[Nurmengard Castle|Nurmengard]].<ref name="COGS"/>

Three months later, Abernathy travelled with Grindelwald and other [[Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes|acolytes]] to [[Paris]], intending to find [[Credence Barebone]] and to spread word of their [[Wizarding supremacy|cause]]. Abernathy took part in the [[Killing Curse|murdering]] of a Non-Magical family in Paris with his fellow acolytes, which allowed them to take over the now unoccupied [[Unidentified home used by Gellert Grindelwald|home]] as a safe haven and base for them. [[File:Grindelwald skull hookah acolytes.gif|250px|thumb|right|Abernathy watching Gellert showing Credence's obscurus]] In this house, he keenly listened to how Grindelwald expressed the utmost need to find Credence Barebone, as Credence was the only key which would allow him to kill his former friend [[Albus Dumbledore]], the biggest threat to their cause.[[File:Abernathy with Vinda.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Abernathy after being disguised as a old woman]]

Using [[Human Transfiguration]], he took on the appearance of an elderly witch to take a [[Lestrange family]] box from [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room|Records Room]] in the [[French Ministry of Magic]], with the assistance of fellow devoted acolyte [[Vinda Rosier]].

====Gellert Grindelwald's paris rally====
[[File:Abernathy joining Grindelwald.gif|250px|thumb|right|Abernathy in the circle of flames]]
He later left the box in the Lestrange tomb for Credence to find. Abernathy attended the subsequent [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|rally of Grindelwald's]] at the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]] as one of his acolytes. When Grindelwald conjured [[Protego Diabolica|a circle of protective fire around himself]] to test the loyalty of his followers, he stepped into the black [[Fire|flames]] unharmed and also disapparated away along with his fellow acolytes (with the sole exception of [[Krall]], who was incinerated in the flames for his disloyalty), showing his intense and unwavering loyalty to Grindelwald and his cause.<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Abernathy was originally a diligent employee at MACUSA holding a position of minor leadership. Notably, he was charged with overseeing the activities of several minor MACUSA functionaries, including the Goldstein sisters. He upheld the conventions of the time and was rather curt towards former Auror [[Porpentina Goldstein]] following her demotion to the [[Wand Permit Office]] for using magic against [[Mary Lou Barebone|a non-wizard]] in front of several equally non-magical witnesses. He also respected authority, falling back while in the middle of reprimanding the aforementioned employee when what appeared to be [[Percival Graves]] entered the room.

Despite his largely strict and conscientious attitude, however, he was not a completely inflexible man, prone to let his feelings get the better of him like any other. This was seen when he allowed the beauty of [[Queenie Goldstein]] to cloud his judgement, letting her steal the recently impounded [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|suitcase]] of [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] before it could be investigated. Following the arrest of [[Gellert Grindelwald]], he took on additional responsibilities at MACUSA, being directly involved in overseeing Grindelwald's containment. This clearly displays what a determined and achievement-oriented person Abernathy was, could be, successfully securing the confidence of (and concealing his new allegiances from) [[President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America|President]] [[Seraphina Picquery]], a keenly intelligent and gifted witch, up until the time he and Grindelwald swapped places.

Even more impressive was the fact that he did so in light of the fact that trained members of the [[Department of Aurors]] set to guard Grindelwald's cell had had to be rotated because Grindelwald's charisma was known to persuade them to join his cause. Like so many other witches and wizards in the [[Rappaport's Law|segregated]] wizarding community of America, Abernathy mistrusted [[Non-magic people|No-Majs]], evidently sharing the sort of 'us versus them' mentality that lead to the introduction of Rappaport's Law and would make the prospect of devoting all his energies to the [[For the Greater Good|Greater Good]] seem appealing. This was most clearly shown by how when he, unlike the [[Alliance|rabble]] of Grindelwald's supporters, became counted among the [[Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes|selected few]] whom their revolutionary leader was utterly unconcerned about showing his ruthless streak in front of, and Abernathy even witnessed the murder of non-wizards and remained staunchly loyal.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Abernathy was capable of apparition, as he was able to successfully disapparate away from the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]].<ref name="COG">{{COG}}</ref>

==Possessions==
*'''[[Abernathy's wand|Wand]]''': Abernathy's [[wand]] was of unknown length, [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]] material. This wand was presumably manufactured by an American [[wandmaker]].

==Behind the scenes==
*Abernathy was portrayed by [[Kevin Guthrie]] in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' and {{COG}}.<ref name="Guthrie 1">{{Wikilink|Kevin Guthrie}}</ref> Guthrie was convicted and jailed for three years for sexual assault in [[May]] [[2021]].<ref name="Guthrie 2">[https://www.mugglenet.com/2021/05/kevin-guthrie-jailed-for-three-years-wont-appear-in-fantastic-beasts-3/ Kevin Guthrie Jailed for Three Years, Won’t Appear in “Fantastic Beasts” 3 - MuggleNet]</ref> When he was convicted, [[Warner Bros.]] announced that Guthrie had been fired from {{SOD}} before production began, making this character's role in future franchise releases uncertain.
*It is currently unconfirmed whether Abernathy joined Gellert Grindelwald before or after the latter's arrest by MACUSA, or what role he played, if any, in Grindelwald's infiltration under the guise of [[Percival Graves]].
*Abernathy's participation in [[Gellert Grindelwald's escape|Grindelwald's escape]] resembles [[Peter Pettigrew]]'s participation in [[Return of Lord Voldemort|Voldemort's rebirth]]. They were both followers of [[Dark Wizard]]s ([[Gellert Grindelwald]] and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]) and helped them return. To this end, they sacrificed a part of the body (Abernathy's tongue, and Peter's hand) that had been disenchanted by their masters for helping them.
