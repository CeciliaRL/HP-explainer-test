'''Pamela Alton''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Ravenclaw]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Biography==
She was usually seen spending time on the lower floor of the [[Clock Tower]]. She thought highly of [[Professor]] [[Horace Slughorn]].<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

{{Quote|I took quite a whack in [[Duelling Club]] the other day. Spent two days in the [[Hospital Wing]] recovering.|Pamela talking about [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)}}

Pamela belonged to [[Ravenclaw|her house]]'s [[Duelling Club]]. One day she duelled Harry Potter and was defeated by him. The blow was so powerful that she spent two days in the [[Hospital Wing]]. She was a fan of [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] and wrote quite a few [[Pamela Alton's letters to Gilderoy Lockhart|letters to him]].<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Etymology==
The name Pamela was invented in the late 16th century by the poet Sir Philip Sidney for use in his poem 'Arcadia'. He possibly intended it to mean "all sweetness" from Greek παν (pan) "all" and μελι (meli) "honey". It was later employed by author Samuel Richardson for the heroine in his novel 'Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded' (1740), after which time it became used as a given name. It did not become popular until the 20th century.<ref>http://www.behindthename.com/name/pamela</ref>
