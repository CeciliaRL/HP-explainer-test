'''Mr Reynolds''' was the father of [[Maisy Reynolds]].<ref name="script"/>

At some point during the [[1997-1998 school year]], her daughter Maisy disobeyed [[Alecto Carrow]], then a teacher at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]], which made the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] "pay a visit" to her father. Alecto Carrow would, afterwards, threaten to do it again if Maisy challenged her.<ref name="script">[http://pt.scribd.com/doc/163084623/HARRY-POTTER-AND-THE-DEATHLY-HALLOWS-PART-2-by-screenplay-Steve-Kloves#scribd ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2'' screenplay by Steve Kloves]</ref>
