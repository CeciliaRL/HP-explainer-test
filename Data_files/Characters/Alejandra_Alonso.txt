'''Alejandra Alonso''' was a [[Brazil]]ian [[wizardkind|witch]] and a [[Chaser]] for the [[2014]] [[Brazilian National Quidditch team]].

==Biography==
In her article for the [[Daily Prophet]] on the [[American National Quidditch team|USA]]-Brazil game, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]] described her as one of Brazil's finest. Ludo Bagman also put her down as the Outstanding Player on the Brazil team during the first two rounds of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]] in his guide which rates the teams who made it to the semi-finals.<ref name="Insider">[http://insider.pottermore.com/2014/05/read-ginny-potters-match-reports-from.html "Read Ginny Potter's match reports from the 2014 Quidditch World Cup every day this week"] at [http://insider.pottermore.com Pottermore Insider]</ref>

Alejandra certainly had a solid game during the tournament. During the Brazil-[[Haitian National Quidditch team|Haiti]] match, her and her fellow Brazil Chasers, [[Fernando Diaz|Diaz]] and [[Gon√ßalo Flores|Flores]], made as many as thirty attempts to score during the beginning of the game, although they only made ten goals. Ginny Potter also commended all three Brazilian Chasers for keeping their heads during the Brazil-[[Welsh National Quidditch team|Wales]] match that was deemed the most contentious matches of the tournament. 

During the USA-Brazil semifinal game, she fumbled the [[Quaffle]] twice, as did her teammate, Fernando Diaz. She compensated for this error, however, by scoring when [[Susan Blancheflower]] was hit in the face by a [[Bludger]], and put Brazil ten points ahead.

==Behind the scenes==
*"Alejandra" is a non-standard spelling of the Portuguese name "Alexandra". It corresponds to the Spanish variation of the name, not the Portuguese.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/alejandra "Alejandra"] on [http://www.behindthename.com Behind the Name]</ref>
