'''Lucy Evans''' (born c. [[1939]]) was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] housewife, and a witness of the [[Millennium Bridge]] disaster in [[1996]], aged 57. She was standing on the riverbank directly beneath the bridge when the collapse took place. She later asserted to ''[[The Guardian]]'' that those responsible were, without a doubt, foreigners.<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:TheGuardian.png|this image]])</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Lucy Evans is presumably named after [[Lucy Evans (real-world)|Lucy Evans]], who worked as an assistant music supervisor on ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'', and as an assistant to [[David Barron]] on ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' and {{DH|F1}}.<ref>"[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2115032/ Lucy Evans]" on IMDb</ref>
*Much like [[Mark Evans]], Lucy is most likely not related to [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] despite sharing a surname.
