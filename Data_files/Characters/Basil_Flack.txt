'''Minister Basil Flack''' was [[Minister for Magic]] in [[1752]].  He may have been appointed a temporary acting Minister instead of being elected by the [[Wizardkind|Wizarding]] population due to the crisis of the [[Goblin Rebellions|goblin rebellions]].

He was the Minister for Magic with the shortest term as of [[2014]], only holding the office for two months. He resigned the post after the [[goblin]]s joined forces with the [[Werewolf|werewolves]], presumably as part of the same [[18th century goblin rebellion|rebellion]] that sparked his predecessor [[Albert Boot]]'s resignation.<ref>{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Basil (name)|Basil]] is a given name derived from the Greek ''βασιλεύς'', meaning "king". ''Flack'' is an alternate spelling of the word ''flak'', which is English slang for "adverse criticism".
