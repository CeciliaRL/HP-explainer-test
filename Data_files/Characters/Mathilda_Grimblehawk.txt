'''Mathilda Grimblehawk''' (fl. [[1999]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] employed at the [[British Ministry of Magic]] as an investigator of [[creature]]-related incidents. During her years at the Ministry, she dealt competently with [[Wizardkind|wizards]], [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and even [[Centaur]]s alike.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mathilda Grimblehawk was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]], into the wizarding [[Grimblehawk family]]. During her formative years, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where she was known to have taken [[Potions (class)|Potions]].<ref>{{FBC|6|4}}</ref> She presumably also took and excelled in [[Care of Magical Creatures]], given her future career as a [[Magizoologist]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}} ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCIfSWgM See video])</ref>

===Career===
After she left school, she eventually joined the Ministry of Magic, where she became an investigator for the [[Beast Division]]. Along with [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|her partner]] (the new intern) she helped investigate several cases involving [[magic]]al [[beast]]s. Their first case together involved an attack on [[Gordon Horton]], [[Quidditch]] [[keeper]] for the [[Chudley Cannons]].<ref>{{FBC|1}}</ref> She believed the Cannons to be the best [[Quidditch team]] in the league, despite their performance last season.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LCMPyqiQI8&feature=youtu.be Youtube - FANTASTIC BEASTS: CASES Android Gameplay]</ref>

Other cases on which she worked included the disruption at the [[Leaky Cauldron]],<ref>{{FBC|2}}</ref> the attack on [[Don Harrison]]'s construction crew,<ref>{{FBC|3}}</ref> the story from the [[Siren's Rest's landlord]] of a [[Wales|Welsh]] lake monster,<ref>{{FBC|4}}</ref> the disappearance of [[Bilius Finbok]],<ref>{{FBC|5}}</ref> the investigation in the sewers of [[London]],<ref>{{FBC|6}}</ref> and the fire at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref>{{FBC|7}}</ref>

According to [[Gethsemane Prickle]], she once, during the course of her duties, decided she would taste a [[Draught of Living Death]] before administering it to a magical creature. Mathilda begrudgingly admitted to it, saying that it had "''only happened'' once".<ref name="FBC2.4">{{FBC|2|4}}</ref>

By [[2018]], Mathilda was working with the newly-created [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] to aid them in dealing with the results of the [[Calamity]]. As a [[Magizoologist]], she ministered the [[Ministry Magizoology Orientation|several]] [[Safety Orientation|courses]] for its members interested in pursuing a career as Magizoologists, including an intensive, week-long one centred on how to ride on a [[Kelpie]].<ref name="WU" /> As a bat-expert, she also helped to improve members' insight into the [[Bat-Bogey Hex]].<ref>{{WU}} ([https://youtu.be/ysjsJI3NGv8?t=753 see video])</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Mathilda Grimblehawk possessed a great enthusiasm for the subject of [[Magizoology]] and great fondness for [[magic]]al [[creature]]s of all kinds. She was also very friendly and sociable, as she delighted in the chance to travel and meet new people as part of her work, and apparently greatly enjoyed [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|her partner's]] company.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magizoology]]''': As a member of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], Mathidla Grimblehawk was very familiar with a wide variety of [[magic]]al [[creature]]s, and knew how to [[Ministry of Magic Classification|classify]] them and the various laws regulating said creatures, as well as how to adeptly handle and understand them.
*'''[[Martial magic]]''': As a field member of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], Mathilda would have become a fairly accomplished [[Duelling|duellist]], at least by the [[2010s]], as she would have received formal training in combative magic under the tutelage of [[Mordecai Berrycloth]] from the [[Auror Office]] as part of her preparations before joining the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.<ref name="WU"/>
*'''[[Potion]]s''': As a Hogwarts student, Mathilda was known to have taken [[Potions (class)|Potions]], a subject which she succeeded in, showing her to have been skilled in the art of potion-making.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Mathilda was capable with charm-work, given how she often performed various charms successfully during her career investigations.
