This '''individual''' (fl. [[1994]]) was a wealthy [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] man, who owned the [[Riddle House]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="GOF1"/>

He did not live in it, nor put it to any use, although he still paid [[Frank Bryce]] to do the gardening before his death in [[1994]]. Nobody in [[Little Hangleton]] seemed to know why he kept the house, although it was said it was for "''tax reasons"''.<ref name="GOF1">{{GOF|B|1}}</ref>
