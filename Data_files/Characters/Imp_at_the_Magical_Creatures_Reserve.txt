==Biography==
During one of [[Nymphadora Tonks]]'s visits to the [[Zonko's Joke Shop]] in the [[1986â€“1987 school year]], this [[Imp]] crashed into her, making her fall and trigger all the [[Dungbomb]]s. Knowing Tonks's clumsy and mischievous nature, the shop's owner, [[Bilton Bilmes]], banned her for good from Zonko's.<ref name="ZDS"/>

Knowing it was actually the Imp's fault, Tonks, [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] went searching for him in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], in which he was giving [[Rosmerta|Madam Rosmerta]] a lot of trouble. Jacob's sibling hit him with the [[Knockback Jinx]] and Hagrid brought him back to his garden. They tried to convince him to go with them and prove Tonks's innocence, but he wouldn't cooperate.<ref name="ZDS"/>

They then tried to "put him in his place" by taking him to see [[Argus Filch|Mr Filch]], but after some unfriendly interaction with [[Mrs Norris]], the Imp disappeared in [[Room 234-00|his office]]. After he was found, he was brought to the [[Training Grounds]] and witnessed Jacob's sibling and Tonks curse each other with the [[Jelly-Legs Curse]]. The Imp finally trusted them enough, and so agreed to revisit Zonko's to clear Tonks's name.<ref name="ZDS"/>

He tripped Bilton and let him set off the Dungbombs himself, and while this proved Tonks's innocence, Bilton banned all Imps instead. He was later convinced to lift this ban by Jacob's sibling.<ref name="ZDS"/>
