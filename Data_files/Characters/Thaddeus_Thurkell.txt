'''Thaddeus Thurkell''' ([[1632]]—[[1692]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who fathered [[Thurkell brothers|seven sons]] who were all [[Squib]]s. He [[Human to hedgehog spell|transfigured]] them into [[hedgehog]]s out of disgust.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

The birth of a single Squib to a [[magic]]al parent was known to be a rare event.<ref name="squib">"[http://web.archive.org/web/20120208051328/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19 Squibs]" at {{JKRS}} (Internet Archive)</ref> This would seem to indicate that the case of the [[Thurkell family]] was quite exceptional, especially as it merited mention on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="PSG"/><ref name="COSG"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Thaddeus successfully [[Human to hedgehog spell|transformed]] his [[Thurkell brothers|sons]] into [[Hedgehog]]s out of disgust for their [[Squib]] statuses.<ref name="PSG"/><ref name="COSG"/> Given how both [[Human Transfiguration]] and [[Trans-Species Transformation]] are both highly advanced and complex forms of transfiguration, this is proof of skill in this field.

==Etymology==
The name "Thaddeus" comes from Θαδδαιος (Thaddaios), the Greek form of the Aramaic name Thaddai. It is possibly derived from a word, meaning "heart", but it may in fact be an Aramaic form of a Greek name such as Theodoros.
