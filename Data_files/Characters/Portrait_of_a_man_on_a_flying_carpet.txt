This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] whose portrait hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] in the [[1990s]], on the seventh-floor level of the [[Grand Staircase]], above a [[portrait of three young ladies]] and next to a [[Portrait of wailing women|portrait of wailing Egyptians]]. He was depicted riding a [[flying carpet]] with a telescope, books and a seagull. He seemed to have befriended a [[portrait of a witch flying to the moon]].<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}} - Chapter 13 (''Flight of the Fat Lady'')</ref>
