The '''first-floor fighter''' was a [[Dark Wizard]] who fought for the [[Death Eaters]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in the [[First-floor corridor]], and later in the [[Onslaught at the Viaduct]] where he charged the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]] with the [[giant]]s.

==Biography==
Born sometime in or prior to [[1981]], to a [[pure-blood]] or [[half-blood]] family, the individual was trained somehow in the [[magic]]al arts. Eventually, he decided to join [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and the [[Death Eaters]] as one of his loyal servants.

On [[2 May]], [[1998]], he was called to arms by the [[Death Eaters]] to participate in [[Battle of Hogwarts|Voldemort's attempt to capture Hogwarts School]]. He was seen fighting in the [[First-floor corridor]] and later at the [[Viaduct]].

During the battle, he was hit with an offensive [[spell]] by [[Ronald Weasley]], that either killed or incapacitated him.<ref>{{DH|F2}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
He was a thickset man with wavy black hair, a pale face with a pointy nose, and wore black robes. He wore a silvery glove.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]:''' To have been accepted into the ranks of the [[Death Eaters]], he must have been a skilled and accomplished [[Dark Wizard]] and with dark magic. He was most likely capable of casting the [[Unforgivable Curses]], along with other [[dark charm]]s and [[spell]]s.Â 
*'''[[Duelling]]:''' In the Battle of Hogwarts, he fought in the [[First-floor corridor]], and survived to go onto the [[Onslaught at the Viaduct]], showing him to be a competent duellist with a considerable degree of skill in [[martial magic]].
