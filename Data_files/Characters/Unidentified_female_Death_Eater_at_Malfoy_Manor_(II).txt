This '''[[Dark Wizard|Dark witch]]''' was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and a servant of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].<ref name="DHF1"/><ref name="DHF2"/> She was present at a [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor|meeting]] in [[Malfoy Manor]] in [[1997]],<ref name="DHF1"/> and also at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]] where she fought along with her fellow Death Eaters.<ref name="DHF2"/> This Death Eater appeared to be one of the older members of the ranks, given her physical appearance.

==Biography==
===[[Meeting at Malfoy Manor]]===
This Death Eater was present at the meeting at [[Malfoy Manor]] in [[July]] [[1997]], where she, along with all the other Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort himself, plotted and discussed important matters. She also witnessed the murder of the kidnapped [[Charity Burbage]] by Lord Voldemort, where she appeared to be disturbed by [[Nagini]]'s slivering across the dining table to devour her corpse.<ref name="DHF1">{{DH|F1}}</ref>

===Battle of Hogwarts===

[[File:Whitehairandlucius.png|200px|thumb|left|She is behind [[Lucius Malfoy]], about to Disapparate]]
This Death Eater later participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. While in the [[Forbidden Forest]], she was seen holding [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] down with ropes alongside several other [[Death Eaters]]. She witnessed the believed death of Harry Potter by the hand of Voldemort. When [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] and the Death Eater have returned to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] via the viaduct, she was standing near the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]]. Like some other Death Eaters she is seen [[Apparition|Disapparating]] and fled the castle as [[Harry Potter]] proved he was not in fact dead and the battle continued. It is unknown if she later survived after Voldemort's final defeat. But if she did, she was later imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] afterwards.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Judging by her decision to flee once she saw that [[Harry Potter]] was alive, she seemed to be one of the less loyal and cowardly of the [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="DHF2" /> She was also shown to be rather frightened and unnerved when [[Nagini]] slithered across the table to devour the corpse of [[Charity Burbage]],<ref name="DHF1" /> further showing her cowardice.
