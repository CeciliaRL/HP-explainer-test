==Etymology==
*Sebastian is a name with Greek and Latin origins meaning "venerable; majestic; revered; exalted."
**As a Greek word meaning "venerable one", Sebastos was an honorific used by the ancient Greeks to render the Roman imperial title of ''Augustus'' (being an honorific for Roman emperors that was a translation of the Latin ''Augustus'') that formed the basis of a new system of court titles for the Byzantine Empire.

*Sebasteia was a military-civilian province of the Byzantine Empire .

==Behind the scenes==
*This individual was likely involved with a young [[Newton Scamander]] and [[Leta Lestrange]] as the casting call for these three characters was announced together.
