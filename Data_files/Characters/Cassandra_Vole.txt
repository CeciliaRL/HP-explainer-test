==Biography==
Cassandra was sorted into [[Slytherin]] when she started attending Hogwarts at the age of eleven. She was soon engaging in bullying her fellow students, including [[Daniel Page]].<ref name="video">[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PeXSF4kpCqk YouTube - Harry Potter: Magic Awakened]</ref>

She overheard Daniel speaking to [[Unidentified 2000s Hogwarts student|a friend]] one day about how he thought hiding magic from [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s was wrong. Cassandra began teasing Daniel, asking if he wanted to be in the paper or be a criminal. Cassandra thought Muggles to be "silly" and frightened of their own shadows. Daniel objected, saying she would be afraid of magic if she didn't have it.<ref name="video" />

Cassandra worked out that he had a Muggle in the [[Page family]], and he told her to shut up. Daniel's friend didn't think Cassandra was worth it, and [[Ivy Warrington]] asked if she didn't like non-magic people. Cassandra told her she did, because she had an uncle who was a Muggle and she thought he was hilarious.<ref name="video" />

Cassandra left, but Ivy run after her and started duelling her. Ivy used [[Vanishing Spell|''Evanesco'']] and nearly hurt Cassandra. [[Neville Longbottom|Professor Longbottom]] intervened and gave [[Discipline at Hogwarts|detention]] to Ivy and her friends.<ref name="video" />

Later that evening, Cassandra, [[Colby Frey|Colby]] and [[Fischer Frey]] snuck out to the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]]. Daniel, Ivy and their friend found out and went to check out why. They watched her until one of the twins noticed. Cassandra then told Daniel's friends she had found out about Daniel's family who had been sent to prison. Daniel then began duelling Cassandra.<ref name="video" />

Cassandra lost the duel, and told Daniel it wasn't over and that he couldn't be trusted.<ref name="video" />

==Personality and traits==
Cassandra had a mean-spirited and conceited personality, and enjoyed belitting those she perceived as below her with her friends, such as [[Daniel Page]].<ref name="video"/> She disliked the sport of [[Quidditch]] and enjoyed [[Herbology]].<ref name="info"/>
