'''Minister Leonard Spencer-Moon''' was [[Minister for Magic]] from [[1939]] to [[1948]]. He was elected at least twice.

Spencer-Moon began his career at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] as a tea-boy in the [[Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes]], and rose through the ranks from there. He became Minister for Magic following his predecessor, [[Hector Fawley]]'s, political downfall for not taking [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s [[Global wizarding war|"For the Greater Good" revolution]] seriously. He proved himself a sound Minister, overseeing a period of great international turmoil in both the wizarding ([[global wizarding war]]) and the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] world ([[Second World War]]). He was also known to have maintained a good working relationship with [[Winston Churchill]], the [[Prime Minister (title)|Muggle Prime Minister]].<ref>{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Coincidentally or not, "Leonard" was [[Wikipedia:Winston Churchill|Winston Churchill]]'s middle name. Also, Churchill was born into the family of the Dukes of Marlborough, a branch of the Spencer family (Churchill's full name was, indeed, "Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill").
*Moon may be related to the [[Lily Moon]] sorted before Harry in {{PS}}.
