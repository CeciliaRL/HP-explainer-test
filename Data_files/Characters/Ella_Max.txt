'''Ella Black (née Max)''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who married a pure-blood wizard [[Cygnus Black I]]. They possibly had four children; [[Sirius Black I|Sirius]], [[Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]], [[Iola Black|Iola]] and [[Elladora Black|Elladora]].

==Etymology==
*''Ella'' means "all" and is short form of a name Alia.
*''Max'' is a short form of a name Maximilian. The name means "greatest".
*Therefore ''Ella Max'' can be translated as "the greatest of all".
*Ella's possible daughter Elladora was most likely named after her, and her name etymology is symbolic: Elladora was Ella's gift, "Dora".

==Behind the scenes==
*This character's name appears only on the version of the [[House of Black|Black family tapestry]] shown in {{OOTP|FA}}. She was not included on the version of the tree which [[J. K. Rowling]] gave to a charity auction in [[2006]].<ref>"[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/blackfamilytree.html Black Family Tree]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> However, according to director [[David Yates]], Rowling provided the filmmakers with a copy of the Black family tree going back eight generations.<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20071218224958/http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/5/24/empire-magazine-feature-on-ootp 'Empire' Magazine Feature on OotP]" from The Leaky Cauldron</ref> The filmmakers presumably received a more complete version of the tree than the one auctioned off, which only goes back six generations.
*Given her placement on the tree in the film, it is possible that this character was the mother of [[Sirius Black I|Sirius]], [[Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]], [[Elladora Black|Elladora]], and [[Iola Black|Iola]] (the third of whom may have been named in her honour). Cygnus would be their father, and Arcturus an uncle.
