==Biography==
{{Cleanup|In-universely speaking, the Year 4 quest should happen before the Year 5 one}}
According to legend, [[Quintaped]]s were a result of [[Human Transfiguration]] on the [[MacBoon clan]], and the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] wanted to prove this but hadn't found a Quintaped cooperative enough. Caelan, despite his reluctance to be [[Untransfiguration|Untransfigured]] back to [[human]], got the Ministry's attention when they heard of his presence, and when an individual at the [[Hog's Head Inn]] tipped [[Rubeus Hagrid]] to him, he naturally decided to take it upon himself to plead on his behalf and brought him to the [[Magical Creatures Reserve]] at some point before or during the [[1987â€“1988 school year]].<ref name="HH"/>

When [[Jacob's sibling]], [[Chiara Lobosca]] and [[Barnaby Lee]] spotted what appeared to be a [[Moon Frog]] (actually [[Sir Ribbithe]] who had been feeding on [[Glow Bug]]s) near the [[Great Lake]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Barnaby took a [[Photo of Sir Ribbithe and Caelan|photo]] of him, on which Caelan could be seen in the background. Unknowing of his identity, Jacob's sibling was curious and asked [[Nymphadora Tonks]] if he had been her in disguise, which she neither confirmed nor denied.<ref name="Quibbler">{{HM|5|THE QUIBBLER: FIGHT FOR THE FRONT PAGE|4}}</ref>

Jacob's sibling was later properly introduced to Caelan by Hagrid. It took a while for Caelan to come out from [[Rubeus Hagrid's garden|Hagrid's garden]], and when he finally did, they noticed he had a broken arm. Jacob's sibling asked [[Silvanus Kettleburn|Professor Kettleburn]] as well as [[Barnaby Lee]] and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] for help, and they came up with an idea of telling him a story of being at Hogwarts. This successfully appeased Caelan who wrapped his arm around Jacob's sibling's leg.<ref name="HH"/>

[[File:Merula approaching Caelan.jpg|250px|thumb|left|[[Merula Snyde]] approaching Caelan, preparing to hit him with the [[Stunning Spell]]]]
They soon brought Caelan to see [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]], who was at first hesitant to treat a Quintaped but later convinced to let them use some [[Skele-Gro]] on him. Just as Pomfrey left, [[Merula Snyde]] showed up and used the [[Stunning Spell]] on him, scaring him into the [[Forest Grove]]. Merula caught up with him and attempted to Untransfigure, but not before Jacob's sibling arrived and stopped her from doing so by pointing out the similarities between her and Caelan. When they talked about his unfortunate life, Caelan became sorrowful, but was calmed down after watching an exhibitive duel between Merula and Jacob's sibling.<ref name="HH"/>

Caelan was then taken to the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] grounds and treated with the Skele-Gro. After he was fully healed, Hagrid stepped in and announced that the Ministry had decided not to Untransfigure him and to let him continue to live in the Magical Creatures Reserve. Jacob's sibling and their friends then gave Caelan a hand settling in to his new home.<ref name="HH"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*This Quintaped can be renamed by the player just like other creatures in the Magical Creatures Reserve, but regardless of whether he's renamed, he's still referred to as "Caelan" throughout the "A Helping Hand" side quest.
