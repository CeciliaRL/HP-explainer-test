'''McClaggan''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1920s]], having been [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] house.<ref name="COG64"/> 

==Biography==
In [[September]] [[1927]], McClaggan was being taught by [[Professor]] [[Albus Dumbledore]] in [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], when the lesson was interrupted by [[Torquil Travers]], the [[Head of Department|Head]] of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], and several accompanying [[Auror]]s. McClaggan tried to defend Dumbledore, much to Travers's irritation, before being ordered to follow [[Minerva McGonagall]] out of the [[Classroom 3C|classroom]].<ref name="COG64">{{COG|S|64}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*McClaggan was portrayed by [[Alfie Simmons]] in {{COG}}.
*Interestingly, even though the official spelling of the surname is given as "McClaggan" in {{COG|S}}, it is homophonous with "[[McLaggen family|McLaggen]]", the surname of [[Cormac McLaggen|Cormac]], a character in the original [[Harry Potter series|''Harry Potter'' novels]]. This has made some speculate the two were meant to be relatives; in an [[Wikipedia:Instagram|Instagram]] Story on 3 January 2021, actor [[Alfie Simmons]] referred to the character he played in {{COG}} as "the grandfather of a character from the originals",<ref name="Instagram">[https://www.instagram.com/alfiettsimmons/ @alfiettsimmons] on Instagram {{see image|File:Alfie Simmons instagram history.jpg}}</ref> but there has been no official confirmation of this.
