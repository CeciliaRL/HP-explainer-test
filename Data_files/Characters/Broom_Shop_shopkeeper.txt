This '''individual''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who owned the [[Broom Shop]] in [[Diagon Alley]] by [[1991]].

He was a blond man with blue eyes and a moustache, and often wore blue robes. He was a polite man, as he would let [[first year]] students browse around his shop, even though he refused to sell them anything, as [[broomstick]]s are contraband for first years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}} - GBC version</ref>
