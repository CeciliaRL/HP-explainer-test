==Behind the scenes==
*Lady Sanguina may have been been inspired by [[Wikipedia:Elizabeth Báthory|Erzsébet Báthory]], a 16th-century Hungarian countess who was accused of killing young women, then bathing in their blood.
*''[[Wikipedia:Carmilla|Carmilla]]'' is a Gothic 19th-century novel written by Sheridan Lefanu and starring a female vampire with that name. The story has been adapted to cinema and comic-books, with the character (or similar characters with the same name) appearing in other franchises.
