Two '''wizards''' were in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] in [[1995]] on the day several [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] students met there to discuss the formation of their own [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[Dumbledore's Army|group]]. They wore cloaks and sat in the corner. [[Harry Potter]] would have thought they were [[Dementor]]s, had they not been speaking in strong [[Yorkshire]] accents.<ref name="OOTP16">{{OOTP|B|16}}</ref>
