These '''individuals''' were the parents of the [[Squib]] [[Arabella Figg]].<ref name="OOTP8"/>

==Biography==
On [[12 August]] [[1995]], during the [[Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter]], [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]] asked Arabella to give information about her parentage to the ministry later after the end of the hearing, asking her to report to [[Percy Weasley]].<ref name="OOTP8">{{OOTP|B|8}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*As Arabella is a Squib, she must have had wizarding parentage, meaning at least one of them was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. It's unknown if Arabella's mother was a witch, her father was a wizard, or if they were both magical.
*Figg may have been Arabella's married name. It is therefore unknown whether or not it was her parents name as well.
