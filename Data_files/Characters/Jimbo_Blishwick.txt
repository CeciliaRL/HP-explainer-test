==Behind the scenes==
*This character appears only on the version of the Black family tree shown in {{OOTP|FA}}. He was not included on the version of the tree which [[J. K. Rowling]] gave to a charity auction in [[2006]].<ref>"[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/blackfamilytree.html Black Family Tree]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> However, according to director [[David Yates]], Rowling provided the filmmakers with a copy of the Black family tree going back eight generations.<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20071218224958/http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/5/24/empire-magazine-feature-on-ootp 'Empire' Magazine Feature on OotP]" from The Leaky Cauldron</ref> The filmmakers presumably received a more complete version of the tree than the one auctioned off, which only goes back six generations.

==Etymology==
''Jimbo'' is a diminutive form of the given name James.
