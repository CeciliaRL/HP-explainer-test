'''Eduardus Limette Black'''<ref>On the Black family tapestry in the ''Order of the Phoenix'' film, only Blacks by birth have portraits, and only their given names are listed on the scrolls beneath these portraits. This indicates that this character was a Black and that Eduardus Limette was his given name.</ref> ([[1820s]] — [[1899]]) was an early member of the [[House of Black]], being older than [[Cygnus Black I]] and [[Arcturus Black I]], but it is unknown precisely how he was related to other known members of the Black family. He was disowned and burnt off the Black family tapestry for an unknown reason. It is unknown whether he was married.<ref>{{OOTP|F}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Eduardus'' is a Latin form of the name Edward, meaning "prosperous, blessed guard". As ''-ette'' is a French diminutive, the name Limette may indicate the Black family has roots in [[France]], like their relatives, the Lestranges and the Rosiers, which would explain why their motto is in French, not the usual Latin. ''Limette'' also means "small lime" in German.

==Behind the scenes==
*This character appears only on the version of the Black family tree shown in {{OOTP|FA}}. He was not included on the version of the tree [[J. K. Rowling]] gave to a charity auction in [[2006]].<ref>"[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/blackfamilytree.html Black Family Tree]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> He was presumably created by the film's production team, with his name being chosen as a tribute to [[Eduardo Lima]], a graphic artist who worked on every [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' film]] from ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' onward.
*Eduardus is the earliest known Black to have been disowned. It is unknown why. Other Blacks who were disowned supported Muggle rights, married non-[[pure-blood|pure-bloods]], provided for disowned relatives, or were born [[Squib]]s.
*It is possible that [[Alexia Walkin Black]], [[Phoebe Black|Phoebe]] and [[Licorus Black]] were Eduardus's siblings.
*He may have been [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin]] house, like many members of his family, if he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].
