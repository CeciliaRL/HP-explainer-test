==Behind the scenes==
*He served as [[President of the United States of America]] during [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander's]] [[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|trip]] to [[New York|New York City]] as well as [[Gellert Grindelwald's escape]] from [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA's]] prison the [[1927|following year]]. His term in office (1923-1929) greatly overlapped with [[Seraphina Picquery|Seraphina Picquery's]] term as [[President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America|President of MACUSA]] (1920-1928)
**As relations between American [[Wizardkind|wizards]] and No-Majs were illegal at the time of his presidency, President Coolidge was unaware of the existence of the [[wizarding world]].
*President Coolidge served as Governor of [[Massachusetts]] prior to becoming Warren G Harding's vice president. Massachusetts is a prominent location for magical history and buildings in the United States, as it it home to [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], The [[Salem Witches' Institute]], and was also the location of the [[Salem Witch Trials]] in the [[1690s]].
