{{Quote|Zabini, who was interrogated after McLaggen, turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what Harry could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold).|Description.|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
These '''seven individuals''' (d. before [[1996]]) were all married to [[Blaise Zabini's mother]] at some point, later having died mysteriously and leaving the widow with "mounds of gold".<ref name="HBP7">{{HBP|B|7}}</ref> Which, if any of them, was Blaise's biological father is unknown.

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that they were murdered by their wife, given how they all died under mysterious circumstances and how their widow inherited significant fortune from them.
