{{Quote|I well remember the time when, during a particularly satisfying sojourn with some fans of mine in the wilds of Essex, I offered to clear a pathway in their quaint, suburban yard (I quail from terming this square of scrub and turf a 'garden'), which had been ubiquitously blocked by several Horklumps.|[[Gilderoy Lockhart]], ''[[Marauding with Monsters]]''|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)}}
These '''individuals''' were fans of [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]. They lived in a quaint suburban house in the wilds of [[Essex]] with a [[Unidentified Gilderoy Lockhart's fans' yard|small Horklump-infested yard]]. They were known to brew [[Celery and Beetroot Wine]] at their home.<ref name="COSG"/>

In ''[[Marauding with Monsters]]'', [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] wrote of the sojourn he spent in these fans' house. He claimed to have rid his fans' yard of [[Horklump]]s.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref> The veracity of these claims is doubtful, as Lockhart was known to have regularly taken credit for other people's achievements.<ref name="COS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref>
