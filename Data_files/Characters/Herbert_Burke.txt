'''Herbert Burke''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who married the pure-blood witch [[Belvina Black]]. Given that Belvina was not disowned by her [[House of Black|family]], who believed strongly in [[Blood status|blood purity]], it is likely that Herbert was a [[pure-blood]]. The couple had [[Belvina Burke's sons|two sons]] and [[Belvina Burke's daughter|one daughter]].<ref>[[House of Black|Black family tree]]</ref> Herbert may be related to [[Caractacus Burke]] of [[Borgin and Burkes]].

==Etymology==
"[[wikipedia:Herbert (name)|Herbert]]" is derived from the Germanic elements ''hari'', "army" and ''beraht'', "bright". The Normans introduced this name to England, where it replaced an Old English cognate ''Herebeorht''. In the course of the Middle Ages it became rare, but it was revived in the 19th century.

There was a real person with this name, [[wikipedia:J. Herbert Burke|J. Herbert Burke]].

''Burke'' means "fortified hill".<ref>[[wikipedia:Burke (surname)|Burke (surname)]]</ref>
