}}'''Adrian Tutley''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] and an [[Animagus]] who could transform himself into a [[gerbil]].

==Biography==
In recent times, Tutley attended the [[International Symposium of Animagi]], and, considering himself one of the far more experienced attendees, was outraged when a team of fourteen-year old students from [[Uagadou School of Magic]] led an exhibition of synchronised transforming into animals such as [[elephant]]s and [[cheetah]]s. Tutley even went on to lodge a formal complaint with the [[International Confederation of Wizards]] because of this.<ref name="PM">{{WW|uagadou}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Tutley was exceptionally proficient with the art of [[Human Transfiguration]], that he learned how to become an [[Animagus]], allowing him to transform into a [[gerbil]] at will.
