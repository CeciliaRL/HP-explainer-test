This '''individual''' (born c. [[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]] and was Sorted into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref name="PSgba">{{PS|G}} - GBA version</ref>

==Biography==
{{Quote|McGonagall is the head of Gryffindor, but she'll still deduct House points from them without mercy.|This boy speaking to [[Harry Potter]] on the first day of term|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}This boy started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1991-1992 school year]], and was [[sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref name="PSgba"/>

On the first day of term, he was pacing by the [[First-floor corridor]], shortly before [[Quirinus Quirrell]]'s [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class. Shortly before his first [[Potions (class)|Potions]] class, he commented on [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s unpleasant demeanour: "''Snape always looks like he smells something bad''". He did not complete Snape's assignment of gathering all the ingredients for the [[Wiggenweld Potion]] (only [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] managed to procure [[Wiggentree bark]]) â€” at one point, he expressed his wish that someone made an Instant Wiggenweld Potion mix, given the difficulty of gathering all the required ingredients.<ref name="PSgba"/>

{{Quote|My brother told me if you take off fast enough, you can look back and see the top of your head.|Shortly before his first [[Flying (class)|Flying]] lesson.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
Before the [[first year|first-years']] first [[Flying (class)|Flying]] lesson, he spent some time chatting about it in the [[Dungeons]]. According to [[Boy who kept a bezoar in his pocket's brother|his brother]], it was possible for one to take off with such speed that one could look back and see the top of one's head.<ref name="PSgba"/>

Shortly after the [[Hallowe'en feast]], he mockingly told [[Harry Potter]] "''I thought trolls lived under bridges, not in restrooms''".<ref name="PSgba"/>

{{Quote|I am not going to get levitation sickness, am I?|Shortly before his first [[Charms (class)|Charms]] lesson.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
Shortly before [[Charms (class)|Charms]] class, he wondered if practising the [[Levitation Charm]] would provoke [[levitation sickness]].<ref name="PSgba"/> He also made fun of [[Quirinus Quirrell]] before one of his [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class concerning the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]], by saying "''I wonder if Quirrell is as scared of the light as he is of the dark?''".<ref name="PSgba"/>

{{Quote|It's always funny until someone gets hurt or [[Avifors Spell|turns into a bird]].|This student is hit by a spell.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
He did not seem to engage in the rumours the rest of the student body conveyed: about the [[Third-floor corridor|Forbidden Corridor]], he said "''I don't think there's anything in the forbidden corridor. And I see no reason to prove that theory''"; about the [[Restricted Section]] he said "''People say a lot of rubbish about the Restricted Section''".<ref name="PSgba"/> He also thought Common Rooms were improperly named: "''Why are they called Common rooms when only people from a certain house can go into them? Doesn't that make them uncommon rooms?''".<ref name="PSgba"/>

{{Quote|Sometimes Hufflepuff players apologise when they score. That's so nice of them.|The boy.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
Throghout the school year, he was confident that [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]] would win the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup|Quidditch Cup]] ("''The Quidditch Cup is as good as in our hands. Maybe we should wash 'em''"), and seemed to be rather competitive about it (''It isn't whether you win or lose... wait a minute, yes it is!'').<ref name="PSgba"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*This student is clearly a [[first year|first-year]] from his dialogue and presence in first-year classes. In spite of this fact, there are multiple [[Prefect]]s during night-time sneak missions that bear his likeness.
*He may be [[Stephen Cornfoot]], [[Kevin Entwhistle]], [[Michael Corner]], [[Anthony Goldstein]] or [[Terry Boot]].
