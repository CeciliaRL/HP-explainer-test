{{Dialogue a-b|Wizard 1|The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard —|Wizard 2|— yes, their son, Harry —|This crowd deep in discussion|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
This '''crowd of [[wizardkind|wizards and witches]]''' was convened near the entrance to a [[Bakery in Surrey|bakery]] in [[Surrey]] on [[1 November]], [[1981]] when [[Vernon Dursley]] was passing through. He overheard snatches of their conversation and realised they were discussing the [[Potter family]]. He was disturbed by this fact, as he generally pretended [[Petunia Dursley|his wife's]] relatives didn't exist.<ref name="PS1">{{PS|B|1}}</ref>
