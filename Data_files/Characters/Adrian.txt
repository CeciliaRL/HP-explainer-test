Adrian grew up to be a photographer, to [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]]'s disappointment, as he hoped more of him. The professor still maintained, however, a good relationship with him.<ref name="script"/>

On [[20 December]], [[1996]], Adrian attended a [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] at [[Hogwarts Castle]], held by his former professor, [[Horace Slughorn]].
