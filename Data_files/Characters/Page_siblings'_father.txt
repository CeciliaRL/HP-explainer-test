'''Mr Page''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] who married [[Page siblings' mother|a witch]] and had three children. They had a [[Daniel Page's sister|a daughter]] and two sons, [[squib]] [[Reggie Page|Reggie]] and [[wizardkind|wizard]] [[Daniel Page|Daniel]].<ref name="MA">{{MA}} ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeXSF4kpCqk see video])</ref>

He was involved in illicit situations, and he involved his elder son in such activities. They were eventually caught by Muggle police, and his wife tried to use her magic to help the two escape. She frightened the police and violated the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] in doing so.<ref name="MA" />

Her efforts didn't help, and she was sentenced to [[Azkaban]] while he and his son were taken to a Muggle prison. The incident was put in a Muggle newspaper under the heading, "The Bloody Pages". His younger son, Daniel was put under the guardianship of his daughter.<ref name="MA" />
