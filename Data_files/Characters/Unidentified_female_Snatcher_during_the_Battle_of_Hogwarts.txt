==Biography==
===Early life===
The woman was born sometime in or before [[1980]], and was at least somewhat learned in the magical arts. Sometime from [[1997-1998 school year|1997-1998]] she became a [[Snatchers|Snatcher]] for the [[British Ministry of Magic|Voldemort-controlled Ministry of Magic]], capturing [[Muggle-born]]s for a reward.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

===Battle and death===
On [[2 May]], [[1998]], the woman participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] with her fellow Snatchers, presumably casting an unidentified blue spell at the shield along with the others. She died at the [[Skirmish at the Wooden Bridge|Skirmish at the Covered Bridge]], and hence was technically killed by [[Neville Longbottom]].<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>
