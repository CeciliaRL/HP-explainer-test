'''Mirabella Plunkett''' (b. [[1839]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] famous for falling in love with a [[Unidentified Merman who fell in love with Mirabella Plunkett|merman]] in [[Loch Lomond]] while on holiday. After her parents forbade her to marry him, she [[transfiguration|transfigured]] herself into a [[haddock]] and was never seen again. She was featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]] and on a [[portrait]] hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Mirabella Plunkett was born in [[1839]] to [[Mirabella Plunkett's father|Mr]] and [[Mirabella Plunkett's mother|Mrs Plunkett]].<ref name="HPPAVG">{{POA|G}}</ref> Nothing about her background or education is known.

===Finding love===
At some point in her life, Mirabella travelled to [[Loch Lomond]] on holiday, where she met and fell in [[love]] with a [[Unidentified Merman who fell in love with Mirabella Plunkett|merman]].<ref name="HPPAVG" />

Mirabella and the merman decided to [[marriage|marry]].<ref name="HPPAVG" /> However, Mirabella's parents objected strongly, and forbade her to marry him.<ref name="HPPAVG" /> In response, Mirabella [[transfiguration|transfigured]] herself into a [[haddock]], never to be seen again.<ref name="HPPAVG" /> It is unknown if she ever returned to her [[merpeople|merman]] lover once she became a haddock.

===Legacy===
After her disappearance, Mirabella was not forgotten. She was eventually immortalised on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="HPPAVG" /> There was also a [[portrait]] of her hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]], which guarded a secret shortcut between the first-floor landing of the [[Grand Staircase]] and the [[Entrance Hall]] side room.<ref name="HPPAVGPC">{{POA|G}} - PC version</ref> The password required to gain access to said shortcut was ''haddock''.<ref name="HPPAVGPC" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Mirabella was highly proficient in the art of transfiguration, given how she successfully transfigured herself into a [[haddock]] fish; a famous achievement in the field which gained her recognition on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]]. Given how both [[Human Transfiguration]] and [[Trans-Species Transformation]] are incredibly complex and advanced branches of transfiguration, this shows her remarkable talent she possessed in this notably very difficult branch of [[magic]].
*'''[[Love]]''': Mirabella was an incredibly loving [[soul]], who famously fell in love with a [[Unidentified Merman who fell in love with Mirabella Plunkett|Merman]] and even went to the drastic measures of transfiguring herself into a haddock, just so she could be with her lover in the [[water]] together as fish, showing her love to have been very strong and powerful indeed.

==Etymology==
The name "Mirabella" is derived from Latin mirabilis, "wonderful".
