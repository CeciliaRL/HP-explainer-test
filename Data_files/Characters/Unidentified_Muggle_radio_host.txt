{{Quote|I don't know about you, it's just too hot today, isn't it? And it's going to get even worse. Temperatures in the mid-30's Celsius...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100. So, please, remember to cover up and stay cool... with the hottest hits on your FM dial.|Radio host|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)}}
