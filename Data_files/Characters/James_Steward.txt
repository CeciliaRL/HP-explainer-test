'''James Steward''' was an [[England|English]] [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] stonemason. He was one of the original members of the [[Plymouth settlement]], in the [[United States of America|New World]]. James was the son of [[Martha Steward]]. He became romantically involved with a [[Wizardkind|witch]], [[Isolt Sayre]] whom he eventually married and had four children with her, [[Chadwick Boot|Chadwick]] and [[Webster Boot]], who they adopted after the deaths of their biological parents, and two biological daughters  [[Martha Steward II|Martha]] and [[Rionach Steward|Rionach]]. He later became one of the four founders of [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|ilvermorny}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life===
James was born in [[England]] to [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Martha Steward]] and an unnamed Muggle father. He had travelled to the New World with the [[Plymouth settlement]] where he befriended a family which included two young boys, [[Chadwick Boot|Chadwick]] and [[Webster Boot]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>

One day, the family went exploring and was attacked by a [[Hidebehind]]. When the family didn't return to the settlement, James went in search of them only to find the boys' parents dead. While he was digging them a grave, he met [[Isolt Sayre]] who had returned to bury the parents after saving their children. However, the family were [[Wizardkind|wizards]], and when James picked up a broken [[wand]] and gave it a wave, it rebelled and threw James across the clearing where he hit a tree and was knocked out cold.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

[[File:Ilvermorny is built.png|250x250px|thumb|left| Isolt nursed him back to health in a small shack]]
Isolt took James to a small shelter and nursed him back to health. When he woke, he discovered Isolt was a [[Wizardkind|witch]]. James was scared at first but while he recovered he often talked to Isolt and formed a bond with Chadwick and Webster. He helped build a stone house upon [[Mount Greylock]] and the group christened it Ilvermorny. Isolt had planned to [[Memory Charm|Obliviate]] James and erase his [[memory]], but by the time Ilvermorny was built, James and Isolt had fallen in [[love]] and decided to get married instead.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

James and Isolt adopted Chadwick and Webster and raised them with magical traditions. Isolt told the boys stories she had heard about [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and both boys wished to attend. Fearful of revealing her history with [[Gormlaith Gaunt]], Isolt would not allow this nor explain why, but assured them that when they turned eleven, they would be given their own [[wand]]s. Shortly before Chadwick turned eleven, Isolt had a dream in which the [[Horned Serpent]] gave her a shard of its horn, which turned into reality when she awoke and visited the creature. She gave this horn fragment to James, who used his skills in woodworking to enclose the core within a wand he carved from [[prickly ash]]. Upon waking on his eleventh birthday, Chadwick was presented with this new [[Chadwick Boot's wand|wand]], which was said to be of "exceptional power."<ref name="Pottermore"/>

===Contributing to Ilvermorny School===
When they came up with the idea of making Ilvermorny into a school, James got to choose to name a house. He went with [[Pukwudgie (House)|Pukwudgie]], in honour of a [[Pukwudgie|creature]] which had befriended his wife before he met her. She had told him stories about her friend which made him laugh.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

By the time Webster turned eleven, Ilvermorny's reputation grew. The school now taught two other families who shared their knowledge of magic. James and Isolt also made them wands, but with different cores. Isolt and James learned to use a variety of other cores, including [[Wampus cat hair]], [[Snallygaster heartstring]], and [[Jackalope antler]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>

===1634===
By [[1634]], the school was flourishing and Isolt had given birth to her and James' twin daughters, [[Martha Steward II|Martha]] and [[Rionach Steward|Rionach]]. Martha was a [[Squib]], but was loved very much by her family.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

However, one day, Isolt's aunt [[Gormlaith Gaunt]] found them. Isolt had fled Ireland to escape her wicked ways. Gormlaith returned to make her pay. She cast a spell over Ilvermorny which kept her and James in a deep sleep. Chadwick and Webster went to stop Gormlaith but James and Isolt were eventually woken by the cries of their daughters. They were eventually saved by [[William (Pukwudgie)|William the Pukwudgie]] Isolt had befriended many years earlier.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

===Later life===
James and Isolt became [[Headmaster]] and [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of Ilvermorny and both lived to be over 100. A [[Ilvermorny statues|marble statue]] of James was made and flanks the front doors of Ilvermorny along with his wife's.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Personality and traits==
Though much remains unknown, James Steward was known to be a [[Love|loving]] father to his four children, biological and adopted, and was known to have been somewhat intimidated by Isolt's revelation to him that she was a witch. However, James quickly overcame this and fell deeply in love with Isolt, seeing her for the kind and loving woman that she was. He was a highly supportive husband, as he indulged and encouraged his wife's passion for teaching, leaving a lasting legacy alongside her.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

He was an open-minded and caring man who encouraged his wife's drive to teach and educate their children and other students in the ways of magic, and used his skills in construction to help build their school with her, proving himself a supportive husband and eager to help others.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

James was also a man eager to explore and learn more, hence why he became the first known No-Maj wandmaker, as he evidently discovered a method for a non-wizard to construct such powerful magical instrument without catastrophe. He was known to be a wise and fair Headmaster alongside his wife and is immortalised in marble at the entrance to his school.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

James was an extremely intelligent man and a skilled wandmaker, despite him not being a wizard.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Abilities and skills==
*'''[[Wandmaker]]: '''James has the great distinction of being the first and only known [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] to have crafted [[wand]]s. He and Isolt made wands for their family and for the people they taught. The wands he created were known to be quite powerful. He and Isolt were the first to discover the properties of several [[wand core]]s unique to [[North America]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>
*'''Craftsman''': James was known to be a highly skilled craftsman, who specialised in stone masonry. He built the foundations of what would eventually become his and his wife's school, [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*James Steward is the only known [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] known to have helped to found a wizarding school, as well as to have been a [[headmaster]] of a wizarding school. He is also the first and so far only [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] known to have made [[wand]]s.
