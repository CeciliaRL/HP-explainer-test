'''Hooky''' was a famous [[house-elf]],<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}} - Console versions</ref> though what he achieved or was well-known for is unknown.

==History==
A small statue of Hooky was located in the [[dungeons]] of [[Hogwarts Castle]], at the bottom of a corridor full of [[Wiggenweld Potion]]s, [[Potions (class)|Potions]] equipment, and ingredients. However, it is unlikely that he worked there at the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|school]] due to [[Hermione Granger]]'s absent knowledge of his kind in the castle.<ref name="POAG"/>

Hooky's statue was one of those required by Hermione in order to complete a challenge set by [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] during the [[1993–1994 school year]]. Every time she found a set of three statues, she was allowed to read a chapter of ''[[The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection]]''.<ref name="POAG"/>
