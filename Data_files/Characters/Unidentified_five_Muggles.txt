This '''family of five muggles''' lived in the town of [[Gaddley]].<ref name="DH22"/>

==Biography==
They were murdered by [[Death Eaters]] or their supporters in early [[1998]], presumably for amusement or sport. [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] authorities wrongly attributed the deaths to a gas leak. Their deaths were reported on ''[[Potterwatch]]'' in March of [[1998]], with [[Order of the Phoenix]] members informing the broadcaster [[Lee Jordan]] their deaths were in fact caused by the [[Killing Curse]].<ref name="DH22">{{DH|B|22}}</ref>
