'''Selina Sapworthy''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]], a [[Gryffindor]] alumna at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and, later in her life, an award-winning author in the fields of [[Herbology]] and plant-related [[Divination]]. She was also a loyal servant to the [[International Quidditch Team]],<ref name="HPLE"/> sometime after her graduation.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Selina Sapworthy was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]] and, in her youth, attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], where she was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]].<ref name="portrait">See [[:File:SelinaSapworthy.jpg|this image]]</ref> During this time, she presumably excelled in the studies of [[Herbology]] and [[Divination]], as she later wrote books on both subjects.

===Later life===
Once she graduated from Hogwarts, Sapworthy became a loyal servant to the [[International Quidditch Team]].<ref name="HPLE"/>

She went on to write a [[Herbology]] [[Book]], ''[[Winogrand's Wondrous Water Plants]]'', focusing specifically on the [[water]] plants among [[Winogrand|Sir Winogrand's]] collection in the [[African Lakes]]. It was part of the required reading at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] for at least a quarter of a century.<ref name="book">{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:Winogrand'sFrontAndBackCover.png|this image]]).</ref> She also published ''[[Xylomancy (book)|Xylomancy]]'', a book exploring the eponymous (and often overlooked) art of [[Xylomancy|Divination by twigs]].<ref name="Pottermore">{{PM}}</ref>

A [[portrait]] of her was hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] by the [[1990s]], near the sixth-floor landing of the [[Grand Staircase]].

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Selina Sapworthy was an accomplished [[Herbologist]] with much knowledge of different [[magic]]al plants and fungi, having written the Herbology textbook ''[[Winogrand's Wondrous Water Plants]]'', a guide which specifically focuses on aquatic plant life, showing she was very knowledgeable and experienced in this field.
*'''[[Divination]]''': Sapworthy was also very skilful and experienced in this rather esoteric and mysterious branch of magic, having authored the book ''[[Xylomancy (book)|Xylomancy]]'', which covers the art of [[Xylomancy]], the form of divination which involves the usage of twigs, showing she had much knowledge of this subject.

==Etymology==
*Selina is the English variant of the name Celine. Celine is a French feminine name that either descends from the Roman name ''Caelinus, ''which is derived from the Latin word ''caelum'', meaning "heaven," or serves a nickname for ''Marceline, ''which is also Latin in origin and is related to the name of the Roman god Mars.

*Selina is also an alternate spelling of the name Selena. "Selena" is the Latinized form of "Selene", a Greek name meaning "moon." Selene was the Greek goddess of the moon, later conflated with the goddess Artemis.<ref name="BTN">[http://www.behindthename.com/name/selena "Selena"] on [http://www.behindthename.com/ Behind the Name]</ref>
*"Sapworthy" may be a variation of the [[England|English]] surname "Sapworth" and a pun on the word "sap," the fluid that circulates in the vascular system of a plant. Both Sapworthy's known published works involve plants in some way.

==Behind the scenes==
*The portrait of Selina Sapworthy featured in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]] seems to have been based on a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/RothwellMaryShelley.jpg 1840 portrait of Mary Shelley], author of the Gothic novel ''[[Wikipedia:Frankenstein|Frankenstein: or, The Modern Prometheus]]'', by artist [[Wikipedia:Richard Rothwell|Richard Rothwell]].
