'''Mr Turner''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was the father of [[Lottie Turner]], an artist, and a [[butterfly]] [[Animagus]].<ref name="MA"/>

==Biography==
He used to say "you could tell a story with three colours and a good oxtail stippler", which meant a paintbrush.<ref name="MA"/>

After his daughter [[Lottie Turner|Lottie]] was born, he often painted with her, and he would sometimes travel off to far places to paint. At some point, he drew himself in his [[butterfly]] [[Animagus]] form.<ref name="MA"/>

He put up a fight when confronted by [[Bly]], a [[Dark Wizard]] in search of the Turner family's heirloom, but was eventually murdered. After Bly was captured inside [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]], he transformed back to himself in his [[portrait]] and spoke with Lottie, allowing her to keep the family heirloom, a brush.<ref name="MA"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': He was remarkably skilled in the art of [[Human Transfiguration]] that he was able to become an [[Animagus]] in the form of a [[butterfly]],<ref name="MA"/> an exceptional [[magic]]al feat considering the difficulty and patience required in becoming one.
*'''[[Duelling]]''': He managed to put up a strong fight against the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Bly]], showing he had a certain level of skill in duelling, although Bly overpowered and murdered him.<ref name="MA"/>
*'''Artistic skills''': He was a talented artist and would often paint [[portrait]]s with his daughter Lottie.<ref name="MA"/>
