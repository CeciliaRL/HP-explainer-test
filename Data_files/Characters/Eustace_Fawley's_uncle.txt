An unidentified '''individual''' was the uncle of a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], [[Eustace Fawley]]. Eustace spoke fondly of him, and how he lived in [[Fiji]].<ref name="FBC7">{{FBC|7}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It's unknown what side of Eustace's family he belonged to. Since the [[Fawley family]] was included in the [[Pure-Blood Directory]] in the [[1930s]], it's unlikely (but not impossible) that they would marry into a Muggle family. He was likely a wizard. 
**If he was a Fawley, he would have been part of a well-known wizarding family.
