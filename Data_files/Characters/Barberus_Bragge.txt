Chief '''Barberus Bragge''' (fl. [[1269]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and chief of the [[Wizards' Council]] in the [[1260s]]. He was responsible for the introduction of the [[Golden Snidget]] into [[Quidditch|Cuaditch]], thus changing the face of [[Quidditch]] forever.<ref name="QA4" /> For this, he was featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="PAg">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bragge was most likely born between the mid to late-[[12th century|twelfth century]] and the early-[[13th century|thirteenth century]]. He presumably attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth, like so many other wizards before him.

===As Chief of the Wizards' Council===
During a Cuaditch (period-Quidditch) game in [[1269]], Chief Bragge released a [[Golden Snidget]] onto the field, and offered the player who captured it one-hundred and fifty [[Wizarding currency|Galleons]]. In protest, the [[Wizardkind|witch]] [[Modesty Rabnott]] [[Summoning Charm|summoned]] the Snidget to her and fled the game. Bragge was furious and was almost going to hex her, when his [[Barberus Bragge's advisors|advisors]] calmed him down and she was fined ten [[Wizarding currency|Galleons]] for disrupting the game. However, the idea caught on, and soon the Snidget was a part of the game, with a new player, the [[Seeker|Hunter]] (Seeker), being added to the team.<ref name="QA4"/>
