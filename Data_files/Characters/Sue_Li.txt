==Etymology==
*Lǐ, written 李, is one of the most common surnames in China. It was the surname of the Tang Dynasty rulers.
*"Sue" comes from the Chinese 素 "plain", or possibly 肃 or 肅 which both mean "respectful". 
*Sue could have been an English name her parents picked for her, instead; it means "graceful lily" in Hebrew.
