'''Fulbert the Fearful''' ([[1014]] -[[1097]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was famous for being so cowardly that he never ventured out of his house. In a twist of irony, he died when a [[Defensive Charm]] backfired and his roof caved in. For this reason, he was immortalised on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Fulbert" is from the Germanic elements ''folk'' "people" and ''beraht'' "bright". Saint Fulbert was an 11th-century bishop of Chartres.

{{Quote|It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default.|[[J. K. Rowling]]'s Harvard Commencement Speech in 2008<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbgvBvjMrn8]</ref>}}
*It appears that Fulbert the Fearful embodies J.K. Rowling's personal belief that living an excessively cautious life is hardly a life at all, and doing so will just makes you lose. She expressed this during her Commencement Speech at Harvard University in 2008.
