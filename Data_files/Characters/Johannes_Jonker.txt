'''Johannes Jonker''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Muggle-born|No-Maj born]] [[wizardkind|wizard]].<ref name="pottermore-1920s">{{WW|1920s-wizarding-america-en}}</ref> He, along with [[Shikoba Wolfe]], [[Thiago Quintana]], and [[Violetta Beauvais]], was one of four [[wandmaker]]s who served [[North America]] in the early [[20th century]]<ref name="pottermore-1920s" />

==Biography==
Jonker was [[Muggle-born|born to No-Maj parents]]. His [[Johannes Jonker's father|father]] was a successful cabinet maker, which presumably gave him early experience with wood-working, and allowed him to become a skilled wandmaker in his own right.<ref name="pottermore-1920s" /> Jonker's [[wand]]s were in great demand and could be easily identified by the [[mother-of-pearl]] inlay they typically contained.<ref name="pottermore-1920s" /> Jonker experimented with several different [[wand core]]s before settling on [[Wampus cat hair|hair]] of the [[Wampus cat]] as his preferred kind.<ref name="pottermore-1920s" />

By [[1926]], he was a known wandmaker and listed on the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]]'s [[Wand permit]] form.<ref name="FBF">{{FB|F}} {{see image|File:Wand Permit - full.png}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Wandlore]]/[[Wandmaker|Wandmaking]]''': Jonker was an accomplished and skilled wandmaker in his time, with his [[wand]]s being highly popular in [[North America]], showing his talent in this field. He was also knowledgeable of [[Wand core]]s and experimented with several kinds of core in his wands.<ref name="pottermore-1920s"/>

==Etymology==
*The surname "Jonker" is a variation of the Netherlands title "jonkheer", meaning "young lord", and can be a honorific or occupational surname indicating an ancestor that served a jonkheer.

==Behind the scenes==
*As a [[Muggle-born|No-Maj born]], it is unknown how, or if, he was recruited to [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] because of [[Rappaport's Law]] restriction on the interaction of wizards with his No-Maj family.
