}}{{Quote|As expected, "Edward Scot" transformed back into Gareth Greengrass as soon as his Polyjuice Potion wore off. I've done some digging since then.

Harry found out  through [[Hermione Granger]] that a bottle of Polyjuice Potion had been taken. Gareth had taken Kensington's appearance again in order to run away unnoticed, but Harry saw 'Edward' leaving in a hurry and stopped him, finding out the truth when the effect of the Polyjuice Potion faded.<ref name="WU"/>
