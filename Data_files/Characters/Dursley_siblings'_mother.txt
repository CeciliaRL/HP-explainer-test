'''Mrs Dursley''' was the mother of [[Marjorie Dursley|Marjorie]] and [[Vernon Dursley]]. Vernon proposed to [[Petunia Dursley|Petunia Evans]] in this woman's sitting room in [[1977]].<ref name="pm-dursleys">{{PM}} - "[https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/vernon-and-petunia-dursley Vernon & Petunia Dursley]"</ref><ref name="date">The date of the proposal can be deduced from a reference in the {{WW|vernon-and-petunia-dursley}} to Lily still being in her [[seventh year]] at Hogwarts ([[1977]]-[[1978]]) at the time of the engagement, as well as a deleted scene on disc two of the Blu-ray edition of {{DH|F1}}, in which Petunia tells Harry, "I have lived in this house for twenty years", indicating the Dursleys were married and settled at [[4 Privet Drive]] by the end [[1977]], since the scene is set in [[1997]].</ref>

==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Dursley|Dursley]] is a town in Gloucestershire, England. [[J. K. Rowling]] has commented that she visited the place as a child and hated it, which likely affected her choice of surname for the awful family, remarking "I don't imagine I'm very popular in Dursley".<ref>[[Wikipedia:Dursley]]</ref><ref>[http://www.darkmark.com/c.c?l=interview2&t=J.K.%20Rowling:%20BBC%20Online%20Chat 2001 BBC Online Chat]</ref> The town is known for its Victorian history in coal mining. Rowling chose the name because it sounded "dull and forbidding".
