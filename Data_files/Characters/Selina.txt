'''Selina''' was a neighbour of [[Chiara Lobosca]] and the two were best friends. When Chiara confessed that she was a [[werewolf]], Selina wasn't afraid at first. However, after witnessing one of Chiara's transformations, which horrified her, her [[memory]] of the incident was [[Memory Charm|erased]] by Chiara's [[Chiara Lobosca's mother|mother]] at Chiara's request. After this, Chiara cut all contact with her, along with people in general due to her condition.<ref name="HM2">{{HM|2|Packmates}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{w|Selina}} is a name derived from Greek "Selēnē" meaning "[[moon]]".

==Behind the scenes==
*It is unknown if Selina was a [[Wizardkind|witch]], [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] or [[Squib]], though intentionally revealing the existence of Werewolves to Muggles would likely be a breach of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]].
