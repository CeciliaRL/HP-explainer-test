This '''individual''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who, in his lifetime, was a [[Seeker]] and [[Head of Gryffindor House]].<ref name="MHP" />

==Biography==
A [[portrait]] of this wizard was hung in [[Gryffindor Tower]]. In [[1995]], he lost his [[Golden Snitch]]. [[Harry Potter]] found the Snitch in the [[Unidentified Gryffindor man (II)|portrait of an old man]]. As a reward, the [[Seeker]] gave Harry one of his Snitches back, which he had been keeping behind his frame.<ref name="OOTPG">{{OOTP|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{OOTP}}, he was credited as '''Quidditch Player''' and was voiced by [[Adrian Fergus-Fuller]]. Unlike the other speaking portraits in the Gryffindor Common Room in the game, he does not reappear in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{HBP}}.
