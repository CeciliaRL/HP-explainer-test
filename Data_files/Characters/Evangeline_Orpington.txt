'''Evangeline Orpington''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[wizardkind|witch]] and a celebrated [[Minister for Magic]], in office from [[1849]] to [[1855]]. She is remembered for being the one who first thought of creating a [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters|concealed platform]] at [[King's Cross Station]], to house the [[Hogwarts Express]].<ref name="kingscross">{{WW|kings-cross-station}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Evangeline Orpington was born no later than [[1832]], into a wizarding family.<ref name="blood"/> In her younger years, she purchased [[Evangeline Orpington's wand|her wand]], made of [[poplar]] wood, from [[Ollivanders|Ollivanders Wand Shop]] in [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name="wands">{{WW|wand-woods}}</ref>

[[Garrick Ollivander]], the famous [[wandmaker]], went on to write that the "tired old joke" among lesser wandmakers that no poplar [[wand]] had ever chosen a politician was utterly unsubstantiated, given that two of the most accomplished [[Minister for Magic|Ministers for Magic]] had fine, Ollivander-made poplar wands: Evangeline Orpington and [[Eldritch Diggory]].<ref name="wands"/>

===Later life===

Ms Orpington was appointed [[Minister for Magic]] in [[1849]].<ref name="kingscross"/>. She was elected Minister at least once.

When one of her predecessors, [[Ottaline Gambol]], authorised an [[Ministry of Magic operation to acquire the Hogwarts Express|operation to acquire]] the [[Hogwarts Express]], the Ministry had seen fit to build a [[Hogsmeade station|railway station]] at [[Hogsmeade]]. The Ministry was not so keen, however, on building another station, in plain sight, in [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[London]], as it would be in all likelihood a serious breach of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]].<ref name="kingscross" />

[[King's Cross Station]] was opened in [[1852]],<ref name="Wikipedia">[[Wikipedia:London King's Cross railway station|"London King's Cross railway station"]] at [[Wikipedia:Main page|Wikipedia]]</ref> during Orpington's time in office. It was only after its opening that the Minister hit upon the idea of adding a concealed platform at [[King's Cross Station]] that could only be accessed by [[Wizardkind|witches and wizards]]: [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]].<ref name="kingscross" />

Minister Orpington was also good friends with [[Victoria|Queen Victoria]], who never realised that she was a witch or Minister for Magic. She was also believed to have illegally intervened [[magic]]ally in the Crimean War.

Minister Orpington left the office in [[1855]], to be regarded as one of the most accomplished Ministers in British history.
