'''Mary I''' ([[18 February]], [[1516]] – [[17 November]], [[1558]]), also known by her sobriquet of "'''Bloody Mary'''", was [[Queen]] of [[England]] and [[Ireland]] from [[July]] [[1553]] until her [[death]] on [[17 November]], [[1558]].<ref name="wikipedia">[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_I_of_England "Mary I of England"] on Wikipedia</ref>

==Biography==
Queen Mary was a [[wizardkind|witch]] and had a [[wand]] of her own. There was a [[portrait]] of her hung at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="MHP">{{MHP}} {{See image|File:Mary I.jpg}}</ref>

She was a daughter of the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] king [[Henry VIII]] and his first wife Catherine of Aragon and thus a half-sister to her successor, [[Elizabeth I]].<ref name="wikipedia" />

==Etymology==
The name "Mary" is the usual English form of Maria, which was the [[Latin]] form of the New Testament Greek names Μαριαμ (Mariam) and Μαρια (Maria) - the spellings are interchangeable - which were from the Hebrew name מִריָם (Miryam). The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including "sea of bitterness", "rebelliousness", and "wished for child". However it was most likely originally an [[Egypt]]ian name, perhaps derived in part from mry "beloved" or mr "[[love]]".
