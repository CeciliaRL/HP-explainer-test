'''Misapinoa Blishwick''' (née '''Black''') ([[1826]] – [[1926]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]]. She was an early member of the [[House of Black]], but her precise relationship to the other known members of the Black family remains unknown. She married a pure-blood wizard named [[Jimbo Blishwick]].<ref name="ootpfilm" />

It is possible that her parents were [[Licorus Black]] and [[Magenta Tripe]]. She was likely an aunt of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]]. It is unknown if she had any children.

She is depicted on the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]] in [[12 Grimmauld Place]], [[London]].

==Behind the scenes==
*This character appears only on the version of the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]] shown in {{OOTP|FA}}. She was not included on the version of the tree which [[J. K. Rowling]] gave to a charity auction in [[2006]].<ref>[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/blackfamilytree.html Black Family Tree] on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> According to director [[David Yates]], Rowling provided the filmmakers with a copy of the Black family tree going back eight generations.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20071218224958/http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/5/24/empire-magazine-feature-on-ootp 'Empire' Magazine Feature on OotP] from The Leaky Cauldron</ref> The filmmakers presumably received a more complete version of the tree than the one auctioned off, which only goes back six generations.
*Misapinoa lived to 99- 100. This is unusual because members of the Black family often died young by wizarding standards.
*The face used to depict Misapinoa on the Black family tree in the ''Order of the Phoenix'' film was also used for [[Lucretia Black]].
*Based on a statement by [[Horace Slughorn]], Misapinoa may have been a member of Slytherin House. However, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] c. [[1837]]-[[1844]], long before Slughorn was even born.
*Misapinoa was maybe a sister of [[Arcturus Black I]].

==Etymology==
Misapinoa's name may be from the word "[[Wikipedia:Messapian language|Messapian]]", an extinct language that was once spoken in south eastern Italy, or it could be from the word "mishap", which ties along with how much older she lived to be than most members of the [[House of Black]].
