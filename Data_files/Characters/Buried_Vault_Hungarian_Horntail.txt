This '''unidentified [[Hungarian Horntail]]''' guarded the inner chamber of the [[Buried Vault]].<ref name="HM530">{{HM|5|30}}</ref>

==Biography==
At some point before or during the early [[1980s]], this Hungarian Horntail encountered [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]], [[Patricia Rakepick]] and [[Peter Pettigrew]] who [[Infiltration of the Buried Vault (I)|attempted to break into]] the [[Buried Vault]]. Pettigrew fled at first sight of the Horntail, and though the other two fought intensely, they were unable to defeat it. The Horntail was then trapped once again in a portrait.<ref name="HM530"/>

At some point near the end of the [[1988â€“1989 school year]], Rakepick [[Infiltration of the Buried Vault (1989)|arrived]] outside of the Buried Vault once more, this time accompanied by [[Jacob's sibling]] and several of their friends. The Horntail initially appeared in one of the vault's [[portrait]]s, but then stepped out and attacked them causing the ceiling to partly collapse. 

While Rakepick cast the [[Slowing Charm]] on the falling rocks, Jacob's sibling used the [[Conjunctivitis Curse]] on it, interrupting its attack and giving the student an advantage. Jacob's sibling [[Duelling|duelled]] the dragon and defeated it, rendering it unconscious.<ref name="HM530" />
