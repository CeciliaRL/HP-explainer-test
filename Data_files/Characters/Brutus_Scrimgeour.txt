[[File:Brutus Scrimgeour.png|250px|right|thumb|Brutus's portrait.]]The name "Brutus" is a Roman cognomen meaning "heavy" in Latin. Famous bearers include Lucius Junius Brutus, the traditional founder of the Roman Republic, and Marcus Junius Brutus, the statesman who conspired to assassinate Julius Caesar.

==Behind the scenes==

*Scrimgeour's portrait was painted by artist [[Steve Mitchell]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161230085403/http://www.stevemitchellscenicartist.co.uk/photo_11369131.html Portrait page] on Steve Mitchell's official site (Archived)</ref> Mitchell created several portraits for the [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' films]].<ref>[http://www.stevemitchellscenicartist.co.uk/section694708_572232.html Portrait portfolio] on Steve Mitchell's official site {{dead link}}</ref>
*On "The Quest of Sir Cadogan" feature on Disc 2 of the ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' DVD, Scrimgeour's portrait appears to be inverted horizontally.
*The phrase ''beati pacifici'', [[Latin]] for "blessed are the peacemakers", is a portion of [[Bible|Matthew 5:9]]. The full verse reads ''beati pacifici quoniam filii Dei vocabuntur'' ("Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of [[God]]").
