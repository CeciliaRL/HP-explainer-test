However [[Anthony Goldstein]] and [[Michael Corner]] (whose houses were initially Hufflepuff) were moved to Ravenclaw, therefore two of the original Ravenclaw students ([[Stephen Cornfoot]], [[Kevin Entwhistle]], Roger Malone and Oliver Rivers) were moved to Hufflepuff.</ref>

'''Oliver'''<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|the-original-forty}}</ref> '''Rivers''' (c. [[1979]]-[[1980]]) was a wizard who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. He was in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] and was Sorted into either [[Hufflepuff]] or [[Ravenclaw]] house.<ref name=house />

==Behind the scenes==
*Oliver Rivers can be deduced to have been listed as a [[Ravenclaw]] on the list of students in a page of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s notes shown on {{HPM}}. However, as two listed Hufflepuffs ([[Anthony Goldstein]] and [[Michael Corner]]) had their houses changed to Ravenclaw in the novels as published, two of those listed as Ravenclaws must have been changed to Hufflepuff. Rivers may be one of those whose house was changed.
*It is likely he was one of the students, whose house wasn't changed, so was a Ravenclaw and shared a [[Ravenclaw Boys' Dormitory|dormitory]] with [[Terry Boot]], [[Michael Corner]] and [[Anthony Goldstein]], because his original surname was Quirrel and [[Quirinus Quirrell]] was a Ravenclaw.
