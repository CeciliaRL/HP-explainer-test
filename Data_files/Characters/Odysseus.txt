__NOTOC__
'''Odysseus''' was a [[Greece|Ancient Greek]]  hero who slew the one-eyed [[giant]] [[Cyclops]] with the help of several [[sheep]].<ref>[[Chocolate Frog Card|Famous Wizard Card]] ([[Cyclops]])</ref>

==Etymology==
The name ''Odysseus'' was probably derived from the Ancient Greek verb '''odussomai''', meaning "hate", suggesting that the name could be rendered as "the one who is wrathful/hated." This interpretation is reinforced by Odysseus's and [[w:Poseidon|Poseidon's]] mutual wrath in Homer's ''The Odyssey''.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[w:Odysseus|Odysseus]] is based on the [[Wikipedia:Odysseus|Greek hero of legend]].
