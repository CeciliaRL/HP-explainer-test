'''Archibald Alderton''' ([[1560s|1568]]–[[1620s|1623]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was known for blowing up the hamlet of [[Little Dropping]] while attempting to [[magic]]ally mix a birthday [[cake]]. Archibald was immortalised on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="FWC">{{COS|G}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Archibald" is derived from the Germanic elements ercan "genuine" and bald "bold". The first element was altered due to the influence of Greek names beginning with the element αρχος (archos) meaning "master". This name was brought to England by the Normans. It first became common in Scotland in the Middle Ages.
