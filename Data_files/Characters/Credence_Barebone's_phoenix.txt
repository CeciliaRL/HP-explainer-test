==Biography==
[[File:Baby chick phoenix COG.gif|250px|thumb|left|Credence nurturing the baby chick]]
In [[September]] [[1927]], Credence and [[Nagini]] met at the [[bird market]] in [[Paris]], and stole some birdseed.<ref name="COG53">{{COG|S|53}}</ref> Later that day in the afternoon, while on top of a derelict rooftop, Credence fed the birdseed to the phoenix chick.<ref name="COG85">{{COG|S|85}}</ref>

Sometime in late 1927, while Credence and [[Gellert Grindelwald]] were at [[Nurmengard Castle]], discussing Credence's heritage, the phoenix chick stepped onto Gellert's palm, who eagerly threw it into air, erupting it into a burst of [[Fire|flame]], birthing the phoenix.<ref name="COG120">{{COG|S|120}}</ref>
