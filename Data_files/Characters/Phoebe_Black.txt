'''Phoebe Black''' ([[1810]] – [[1882]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], and possibly a sister of [[Alexia Walkin Black|Alexia Walkin]], [[Hesper Black|Hesper]], [[Licorus Black|Licorus]] and [[Eduardus Limette Black|Eduardus Limette]]. She was also possibly the aunt of [[Cygnus Black I]], [[Misapinoa Black|Misapinoa]] and [[Arcturus Black I]].<ref>{{OOTP|F}}</ref> She never married or had any children.

[[Wikipedia:Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]] is a Titaness of the [[Moon]] in the [[Greece|Greek]] mythology. She is a daughter of the Sky and the Earth, [[wikipedia:Uranus (mythology)|Ouranos]] and Gaea.<ref>She is mentioned as their daughter by [[wikipedia:Hesiod|Hesiod]] in ''Theogony''.</ref> She is by her brother [[Wikipedia:Coeus|Coeus]] the mother of [[Wikipedia:Leto|Leto]] and Leto is by her cousin Zeus the mother of [[wikipedia:Apollo|Apollo]] ([[Wikipedia:Sun|Sun]]) and [[Artemis (goddess)|Artemis]] ([[Moon]]).

There is also a bird called [[Wikipedia:Black Phoebe|The Black Phoebe]], ''Sayornis nigricans''.

[[Wikipedia:Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]] is also the name of a moon of Saturn that is described as being [[Wikipedia:Lampblack#Pigment|lamp black]] in colour. This loosely fits in with the Black family tradition of using celestial names for their children.

Black can be considered a colour, and is the result of the absence of, or complete absorption of, light. In Western culture, the colour black has typically been associated with evil, darkness, and witchcraft, but also with prestige and sophistication — appropriate for the House of Black. Black has also been associated with life and prosperity by other cultures. In ancient [[China]], black was the symbol of the element of water, which also corresponds to Slytherin, the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts house]] of almost all members of the Black family. In English heraldry, black represents darkness and ignorance; a possible allusion to the prejudice common to members of the House of Black.

However, the English word ''black'' is derived from either the Old English ''blœc'', meaning "black", or ''blac'', meaning "pale". Pallor is associated with sickness and the colour white, which is usually held to symbolise purity in Western and Indian culture, and death in East Asian cultures. This mirrors the typical colouring of members of the House of Black — dark hair and pale skin.

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on a statement of [[Horace Slughorn]], Phoebe was possibly a member of the [[Slytherin]] house. However, she attended Hogwarts from [[1821]] to [[1828]], before Slughorn was even born.
*This character appears only on the version of the Black family tree shown in {{OOTP|FA}}. She was not included on the version of the tree which [[J. K. Rowling]] gave to a charity auction in [[2006]].<ref>"[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/blackfamilytree.html Black Family Tree]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> However, according to director [[David Yates]], Rowling provided the filmmakers with a copy of the Black family tree going back eight generations.<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20071218224958/http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/5/24/empire-magazine-feature-on-ootp 'Empire' Magazine Feature on OotP]" from The Leaky Cauldron</ref> The filmmakers presumably received a more complete version of the tree than the one auctioned off, which only goes back six generations.
*[[Charis Black]]'s face is very similar to Phoebe's in the films' tapestry. This is because moviemakers wanted to save time when they were making the tapestry. They also did the same thing with [[Elladora Black|Elladora]] and [[Callidora Black|Callidora]]'s pictures.
*She is one of the few Blacks not to bear the name of a star, but it still has a connection to astronomy (''see Etymology'').
