==Etymology==
"David" is from the Hebrew name דָּוִד (''Dawid''), which was probably derived from Hebrew דוד (''dwd'') meaning "beloved". [[Goliath's slayer|David]] was the second and greatest of the kings of Israel, ruling in the 10th century BC. Several stories about him are told in the Old Testament, including his defeat of [[Goliath]], a [[giant]] [[Wikipedia:Philistines|Philistine]]. This name has been used in Britain since the Middle Ages. It has been especially popular in Wales, where it is used in honour of the 5th-century patron saint of Wales (also called Dewi), as well as in Scotland, where it was borne by two kings.
