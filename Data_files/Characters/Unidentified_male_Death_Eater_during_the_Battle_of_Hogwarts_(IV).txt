This '''wizard''' (d. [[2 May]] [[1998]]) was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] that fought during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[1998]] and was killed during the battle. Before that, he was seen as the Death Eaters and [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] first attacked the castle and broke down the defences. He was also seen towards the end of the battle. He was one of the Death Eaters who had tied up [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] while he held the "dead" body of [[Harry Potter]]. He was killed later during the second part of the battle.<ref>{{DH|F2}}</ref>
