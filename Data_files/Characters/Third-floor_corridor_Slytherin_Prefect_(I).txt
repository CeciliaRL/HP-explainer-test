This '''individual''' (born c. [[1974]]–[[1976]]) was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who, in the early [[1990s]], was one of the [[Slytherin]] [[Prefect]]s at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="PSgba">{{PS|G}} - GBA version</ref>

==Biography==
{{Quote|Harry Potter! You know casting spells at prefects is against the rules! 6 points from Gryffindor!|This student is hit by a spell.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
He was patrolling the [[third-floor corridor]] on the night of [[4 June]], [[1992]]. When [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] passed by [[Peeves]], he heard something and started pacing fast by the corner to the [[Third-floor corridor|Forbidden Corridor]].<ref name="PSgba" />

{{Quote|Lost in the dark, not quite sure where you're going… quite typical of you, Potter. 6 House points from Gryffindor for being out at night.|The prefect catches [[Harry Potter]] breaking school rules.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}

==Behind the scenes==
*This NPC has the distinction of making its only appearance when the player is making its way to the Forbidden Corridor. Unlike the other [[Prefect]]s in night sneak missions, who are recurring and sometimes copies of sprites depicting first-year students during the day, this character makes a single appearance during the entire game.
