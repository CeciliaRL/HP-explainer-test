'''Nellie Lo Russell''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Muggle|No-Maj]] woman in the early [[20th century]].<ref name="fb-paper">"[http://www.gazette-du-sorcier.com/Compte-rendu-ouverture-de-l-exposition-Harry-Potter-a-Bruxelles-pour-Noel Compte-rendu : ouverture de l’exposition Harry Potter à Bruxelles pour Noël]" from the Gazette du Sorcier {{see image|File:New York Chronicle - Monday Dec 1926 (HQ).png}}</ref><ref name="eveningworld">[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030193/1922-11-21/ed-1/seq-1/ Front page of the 21 November 1922 issue of ''The Evening World''] from Chronicling America</ref>

Mrs Russell testified during the trial of [[Hall's wife|Mrs Hall]] for the [[14 September]] [[1926]] murders of her husband [[Hall|Reverend Hall]] and [[Mills|Mrs Mills]].<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> She stated that, on the night of 14 September, [[Gibson|Mrs Gibson]] had visited her, and had also spent time at her own home.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" />  This seemed to disprove Mrs Gibson's claim to have sighted Mrs Hall in [[De Russey Lane]] with a male companion, presumed to have been her accomplice, on the night of the murders.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> However, testimony from [[George Sipel]] apparently discredited Mrs Russell's alternate testimony.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> The trial was reported on in the [[6 December]] 1926 issue of the ''[[New York Chronicle]]''.<ref name="fb-paper" />

==Behind the scenes==
*The text of the article mentioning Nellie Lo Russell in the [[:File:New York Chronicle - Monday Dec 1926 (HQ).png|prop issue]] of the ''[[New York Chronicle]]'' featured in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' was taken from the real [[21 November]] [[1922]] issue of ''[[wikipedia:The Evening World|The Evening World]]''.<ref name="eveningworld" /> This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in [[1926]], but the actual events referenced occurred in 1922.
