'''Melusine''' was a [[France|French]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived in the [[1920s]]. She worked in the [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room]].<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>
==Biography==
In [[1927]], [[Newton Scamander]] and [[Porpentina Goldstein]] encountered Melusine when they looked to access the [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room]], and were allowed entrance. [[Leta Lestrange]] later met her for the same reason. This caused Melusine obvious suspicion, given how Goldstein had in fact claimed to have been Lestrange beforehand.<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>

By the time the three were to leave, they were faced with Melusine and a handful of [[Matagot]]s, beastly black felines who guarded the Ministry. When Leta attempted to [[Stunning Spell|stun]] one, it multiplied and began to attack them in larger numbers. Thankfully, Newt managed to have them all escape with the help of his [[Zouwu]] in his [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|suitcase]]<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>
