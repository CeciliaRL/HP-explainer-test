There was an '''ice cream salesclerk''' at the [[zoo]] entrance, selling ice creams in her van.

On [[23 June]], [[1991]], she sold two chocolate ice creams to [[Dudley Dursley]] and [[Piers Polkiss]] and a cheap lemon ice lolly to [[Harry Potter]], only because she asked him what he wanted before [[Vernon Dursley]] could hurry him away.<ref name="PS2"/>
