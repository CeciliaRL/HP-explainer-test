==History==
{{Quote|Oh, good, you’ve fed the chickens. We’d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow...|Molly Weasley planning the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
In [[July]] 1997, [[Molly Weasley]] asked [[Harry Potter]] to help [[Arthur Weasley]] muck out the chicken coop, but there was very little to do for the chickens because Arthur was using the coop to store the remains of [[Sirius Black's motorbike]]. After the arrival of the Delacour family, Harry, [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] volunteered to feed the chickens to escape the overcrowded house, but were soon approached by Mrs Weasley, who wanted to discuss arrangements for the wedding.<ref name="DH6">{{DH|B|6}}</ref>
