A '''painting of a [[hippopotamus]]''' hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] in one of the topmost levels of the [[Grand Staircase]].<ref name="Height">The painting was in a higher level than the [[Fat Lady]] in {{POA|F}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Fatlady...JPG|250px|thumb|left|The [[Fat Lady]], hiding in this painting]]
On [[31 October]], [[1993]], [[Sirius Black]] attacked [[Fat Lady]]'s portrait in a vain attempt to gain entrance to [[Gryffindor Tower]]. Scared, the [[Fat Lady]] ran away hiding in other paintings, including this one, where she hid behind the hippopotamus.<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*During the production stages of {{POA|FA}}, director [[Alfonso Cuarón|Alfonso Cuaron]] was having difficulty deciding on a final design for this painting and its interaction with the Fat Lady. In order to "provoke" him into making a final decision, concept artist Dermot Power jokingly drew a [http://www.dermotpower.com/hp3/1/14.html piece of concept art] depicting the Fat Lady lying in bed with a smoking hippopotamus that was strongly suggestive that the pair had just had sex.
