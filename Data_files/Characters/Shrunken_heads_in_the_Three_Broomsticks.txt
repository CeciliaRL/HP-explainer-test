{{Dialogue a-b-c|Shrunken Head|I say! No underage wizards allowed in today! Shut the damn door!|Hermione|So rude.|Ron|Thick heads.|Hermione and Ron to the talking Shrunken Heads guarding [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] in [[1993]]|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)}}
These '''[[Shrunken head]]s''' hung in the entrance of the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] in [[Hogsmeade]].<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}} - Chapter 16 (''The Marauders Map'')</ref>

During the [[1993–1994 school year]], they stopped [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] from entering the pub during a [[Hogsmeade]] [[Hogsmeade weekend trips|weekend visit]] as no underage [[Wizardkind|wizards]] were allowed in that day. [[Harry Potter]], however, was able to slip past them under his [[Cloak of Invisibility|Invisibility Cloak]].<ref name="POAF" />

== Behind the scenes ==

*The talking shrunken heads were additional characters created for {{POA|FA}}, never appearing in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|Harry Potter books]] nor in previous or subsequent film adaptations. However, it was well-received, in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]] DVD Special Feature: ''Interview with [[J. K. Rowling]] and [[Alfonso Cuarón]], ''J.K. Rowling did endorse the addition. Rowling had said she wished she thought of the idea, and if she had the ability, would shrink her own head temporarily to scare away unwanted visitors and tax collectors, who would likely flee from her in horror.
*The film's addition is presumably why in {{HBP}}, Rowling decided to write that Vincent Crabbe got a shrunken head confiscated by Filch.

*The shrunken heads were voiced by Brian Bowles and Peter Serafinowicz in the film adaptation of {{POA}}. Bowles also played the a headless [[ghost]] in the same film.{{Fact}}
*In the DS version of {{LEGO|Y1}}, they are replaced by a wizard guarding the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]].
*The middle shrunken head bears a slight resemblance to [[Dre Head]].
