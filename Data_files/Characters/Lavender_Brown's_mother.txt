On [[2 May]], [[1998]], her daughter died during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] when she was attacked by [[Fenrir Greyback]].<ref name="PageToScreen">{{HPPS}}, page 215 - "Jessie Cave was also happy to come back, even knowing that Lavender Brown wasn't going to survive the final film. "She's not very lucky," the actress understates. "She doesn't meet a nice ending. She gets eaten by Fenrir Greyback. Cave recalls her death scene, which took several nights of shooting. "I had the most amazing prosthetic of a scar that looks so scary, it looked like I was actually mauled to death." </ref>
