'''Gringott''' (fl. [[1474]])<ref name="WWoHP" /> was a celebrated [[goblin]] who founded [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] in [[1474]].<ref name="WWoHP">{{WWHP}} {{see image|File:Gringotts1474Ref.png}}</ref> For the Bank's founding and presumable management, Gringott was featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Gringott.png|150px|thumb|left|Gringott's [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]
*Gringott's [[Chocolate Frog Card]] does not give out his dates. However, since it is known that Gringotts Bank was established in [[1474]], we can assume that he lived sometime in the [[15th century]].
*There is a gold statue of Gringott standing on a pile of coins at [[Diagon Alley]].<ref>[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDirvZa_8zU Behind the Bricks: A Tour of Diagon Alley with Tom Felton and Matthew Lewis - Full Webcast] at [http://www.youtube.com/ Youtube]</ref>
