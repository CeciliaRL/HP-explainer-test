{{Quote|Among those who claimed to have invented this revolutionary spell was the German warlock Garvin Lügner, who insisted that he had invented it as a side-effect of his discovery of Instant Darkness Powder.|[[Miranda Goshawk]], ''[[Book of Spells]]''.|Wonderbook: Book of Spells}} 
'''Garvin Lügner''' (fl. [[18th century]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[warlock]] who invented the [[Instant Darkness Powder]], presumably intended as a variant of [[Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder]]. However, unlike the true substance, which provides absolute darkness, Garvin's powder merely slightly dimmed the lights.<ref name="WBS"/>

However, this did not discourage Garvin from falsely claiming he had invented the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]], ''Lumos'', to remedy the effects of his powder. The Wand-Lighting Charm was actually invented in [[1772]], by [[Levina Monkstanley]], a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]].<ref name="WBS">{{WBS}} - see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9LNQV7cGIA&feature=relmfu this video]</ref>
