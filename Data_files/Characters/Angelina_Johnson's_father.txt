'''Mr Johnson''' was the father of [[Angelina Johnson]]. 

==History==
In [[July]] [[2014]], shortly before the final of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]], he fell ill, and Angelina left her marital home to care for him. This sparked several rumours that Angelina had walked out on her husband, [[George Weasley]], because she had "grown restless" in their marriage.<ref name="PM">{{PM}} - [[2014 Quidditch World Cup final]] (Archived)</ref>
