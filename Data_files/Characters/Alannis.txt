'''Alannis''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Ravenclaw]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. She was at least in her [[first year]] by [[1996]] and was the captain of the Ravenclaw [[Duelling Club]] but due to her being trusted to be captain, it is likely she was at least in her [[second year]].<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Biography==
Alannis was sorted into [[Ravenclaw]] when she arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. In [[1996]] Alannis became captain for [[Ravenclaw]] when the [[Duelling Club]] was revived by [[Albus Dumbledore]] as a precaution to help students defend themselves if the event of an attack from [[Death Eaters]] or [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was ever to happen. [[Minerva McGonagall]] convinced [[Harry Potter]] to join the Ravenclaw Duelling Club, introducing him to Alannis, who requested that he showed a group of watching Ravenclaws how to cast ''[[Levicorpus]]''. After her duel with Harry she jokingly told him to watch his back as other Ravenclaws might hit him with their newly learnt [[jinx]].<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Duelling]]''': As head of the [[Ravenclaw]] [[Duelling Club]], Alannis was a highly skilled duellist, who was proficient with the casting of various offensive and defensive spells, such as the [[Stunning Spell]], [[Shield Charm]], [[Disarming Charm]] and ''[[Levicorpus]]'', showing she was talented with [[Martial magic]].<ref name="HBPG"/>
