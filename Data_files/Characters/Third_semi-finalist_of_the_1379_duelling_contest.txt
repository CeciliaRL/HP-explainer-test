This '''individual''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who, in [[1379]], partook in an [[1379 duelling contest|international duelling contest]] on [[Dartmoor]].<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}}</ref>

==Biography==
The duelling was noted, by witnesses, to have been of a standard that few had ever seen before. As the contest progressed, only four contestants remained: this wizard, two other wizards, and an [[England|English]] witch, [[Elizabeth Smudgling]].<ref name="WBoS"/>

The [[First semi-finalist of the 1379 duelling contest|first semi-finalist]] was defeated by the [[Second semi-finalist of the 1379 duelling contest|second semi-finalist]], making this individual face the second wizard.

His opponent brought a great storm cloud down from the sky, drenching him in freezing-cold [[Water|rain]] and forcing him to evade bolts of lightning. He then got the idea to call a powerful cyclone, which not only blew away the storm, but also the [[Second semi-finalist of the 1379 duelling contest|second wizard]], the [[Judges of the 1379 duelling contest|judges]], most of the spectators and several trees.<ref name="WBoS" />

It took several hours for everyone to regroup. Frightened of what the third wizard might do for his encore, the [[Judges of the 1379 duelling contest|judges]] attempted to talk [[Elizabeth Smudgling]], the last remaining finalist, out of duelling him, telling her that it might be easier if they simply gave him the cup before anyone else got hurt, but she refused.<ref name="WBoS" />

[[Elizabeth Smudgling|Smudgling]] and the third wizard then went up against each other. On the count of three, the wizard began a [[Mountain-moving spell|long, complex incantation that would have caused a mountain to break out of the ground]] and fall upon Smudgling's head had he been given the opportunity to complete it. However, Smudgling beat him to the punch, quickly murmuring the incantation for the [[Disarming Charm]] and sending his wand flying out of his hand. She was awarded the title of "[[Supreme Dueller]]" and the Disarming Charm became one of the most useful spells in any dueller's repertoire.<ref name="WBoS" />
