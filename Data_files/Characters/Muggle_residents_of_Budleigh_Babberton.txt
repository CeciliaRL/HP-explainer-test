This '''family''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] one, comprised of a couple and two children. They resided in a [[Muggle house where Horace Slughorn stayed|house]] in [[Budleigh Babberton]].<ref name="HBP4"/>

==History==
In [[1996]], while these [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] were on holiday in the [[Canary Islands]], [[Horace Slughorn]] hid in their home from [[Death Eaters]] attempting to recruit him.<ref name="HBP4">{{HBP|B|4}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|novel]], the narrator tells us that "If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady", given the contents of the house: soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. It is unknown if the furniture belonged to these [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] or if it was [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn's]], as he was known to bring at least some furniture with him (i.e. the grand piano).
