During the 1988–1989 school year they befriended Ismelda Murk. When Xenophilius Lovegood announced a contest for a front-page photo of a magical creature on The Quibbler and prize of 87 Galleons, Ismelda recruited them in a secret attempt to hunt down a suspected werewolf - Chiara Lobosca. She intended to capture Chiara with the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] before the full moon to both win the prize and expose [[Albus Dumbledore]] for harbouring a werewolf on campus. This was thwarted by Jacob's sibling who used the [[Knockback Jinx]] to push Chiara out of harm's way, and then by [[Tulip Karasu]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] in a werewolf costume convincing Ismelda that there was no real werewolf in the school.<ref name="Quibbler"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Despite the original [[Harry Potter (book series)|''Harry Potter'' books]] having depicted [[Slytherin]]s as having hostile rivalries with students of other houses (especially [[Gryffindor]]s) and generally only befriending each other, Ismelda's unidentified friends are shown to belong to other houses, which seems very strange considering the common differences between Slytherins and other students, along with Ismelda's strongly stereotypical Slytherin traits (support for [[Pure-blood supremacy]], the [[Dark Arts]], [[Dark Wizard]]s etc., traits which students of other houses usually reject). However, it is appears that these students were attracted towards Ismelda's unpleasant personality due to their own self-professed negative features, along with wanting to a desire to feel important and powerful.
