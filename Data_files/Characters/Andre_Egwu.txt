'''Andre Egwu''' (born c. [[1973]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1984]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref>{{HM|2}} onward, Andre was seen in the same Transfiguration class as Jacob's sibling and Rowan Khanna, meaning they are in the same year.</ref> He was a devoted fan of the [[Pride of Portree]] [[Quidditch team]].

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1972/1973-1984}}===
During his childhood he would occasionally meet with his cousin [[Jules Egwu]] when her family was in town. They had a friendly relationship, despite her then shy personality and difficulties with making friends.<ref name="HM3">{{HM|3|A SCANDAL IN HOGSMEADE}}</ref>

===Hogwarts years {{C|1984-1990}}===
[[File:Andre_Egwu_HM.jpeg|120px|thumb|left|Andre during [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration class]]]]
During his time at Hogwarts, Andre was in the same [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration class]] with [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Rowan Khanna]], in which he expressed liking animals.<ref>{{HM|2}} onward, when Transfiguration becomes available, one possible speech bubble would be ''"I love animals."'' by Andre.</ref>

Throughout their school years, Andre would put his sense of style to use in making outfits for [[Jacob's sibling|Jacob's sibling]], and sometimes other students, to wear at special events. He would usually make a couple of different outfits and allow his friend to choose their favourite.  

====Second year ====
In the [[1985–1986 school year]], Andre was asked by [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]] to show the other students in his year how to weave during [[Flying (class)|Flying class]].<ref>{{HM|2|8|8f}}</ref>

Andre joined the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]], initially as a reserve [[Seeker]]. He was exceptionally skilled at flying, but was not good at playing as a Seeker.<ref name="Q22" /> Despite this, he was considered the best [[Quidditch]] player at the school by some, though he himself thought that [[Charles Weasley]] was better. He was among the team members trapped by [[cursed ice]] in the [[Quidditch Changing Rooms]].<ref>{{HM|2|9}}</ref><ref name="yr3ch3" />

====Third year====
In the [[1986–1987 school year]], Andre was asked by Madam Hooch to show the other students in his year how to roll during Flying class.<ref>{{HM|3|1|f}}</ref> Andre also took the [[Muggle Studies]]<ref>{{HM|7|3}}</ref> as electives.

Andre properly introduced himself to [[Jacob's sibling]] on their first [[Hogsmeade weekend trips]],<ref name="yr3ch3" /> though they had met in Transfiguration and Flying classes before. During this year, Andre also revealed to [[Jacob's sibling]] that despite what people had heard of him, he was only a reserve Seeker, not an actual player on the team.<ref name="Q22" />

Andre eventually became the [[Keeper]] of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team, a position at which he proved to be more talented. He replaced previous Keeper [[Brennan Doyle]].<ref name="">{{HM|6|Poor Sport}}</ref>

Andre also helped Jacob's sibling when they were appointed a [[beater]] on their house [[Quidditch]] team. When they decided that they needed more training to have a chance to win the [[Inter-House Quidditch Cup]], Andre suggested that they train with his friend [[Erika Rath]], despite the stormy history between Rath and Jacob's sibling. Jacob's sibling eventually won Rath's respect and Andre sometimes joined them during training.

At some time during this year, [[Jules Egwu|Jules]] came to [[Hogsmeade]] to visit him. He was surprised, and pleased, by the change in her as she was much more confident and outgoing than the last time he had seen her. She attributed this to being with him as seeing how comfortable he was in his own skin eventually helped her to find the courage to be herself. 

During this time Andre, Jules, [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Penny Haywood]] investigated a series of thefts of sweets around Hogsmeade and Hogwarts. The culprit turned out to be [[Unidentified Demiguise|a Demiguise]] with a sweet tooth that the group managed to track down and capture. Jules took it with her when she returned to [[Japan]], as it was part of the creature's natural habitat range, and planned to ask her [[Magizoologist]] parents to find an appropriate site to release it.<ref name="HM3">{{HM|3|A SCANDAL IN HOGSMEADE}}</ref> 

====Fourth year====
In the [[1987–1988 school year]], Andre expressed needing new buttons for his cloaks during the [[Beetle into Button|Button to Beetle]] Transfiguration lesson.<ref>{{HM|4|8|t}}</ref> During the lesson on the [[Snake Summons Spell]], he wondered if he would have been judged should he wear [[snake skin|snakeskin]] trousers.<ref>{{HM|4|12|t}}</ref>

====Fifth year====
In the [[1988–1989 school year]], after finishing the [[Potions (class)|Potions]] [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]], [[Charles Weasley]] asked [[Jacob's sibling]] for help, for Andre apparently didn't think revisions were needed.<ref>{{HM|5|Ordinary Wizarding Levels|1}}</ref> The three met up at the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]], where Andre's dream to become a professional [[Keeper]] was revealed to be his reason for disregarding preparations for the exam. After Jacob's sibling persuaded Andre to take the exam a little more seriously, the three chatted about [[Jobs in the wizarding world|careers]] over [[Butterbeer]].<ref name="owl">{{HM|5|Ordinary Wizarding Levels|2}}</ref>

====Sixth year ====
Sometime during his sixth year, Andre became a founding member of the [[Circle of Khanna]], a group devoted to avenging [[Rowan Khanna]] and locating the final [[Cursed Vaults|cursed vault]]. It was at the groups first meeting in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] that he learned of the malevolent organisation "[[R]]" and it's [[Plot to find the Cursed Vaults|motives]] to locate the final Cursed Vault before them.<ref name="hm20" />

==Physical appearance==
Andre had short black hair, dark skin and handsome brown eyes. He also usually wore a [[Pride of Portree]] scarf.<ref>{{HM|3|3}} - He has worn the same scarf upon first appearance in Year 2, though only until this chapter where it was confirmed to be the [[Pride of Portree]] scarf.</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
[[File:Andre Flying Class.jpeg|200px|thumb|Andre during a Flying Lesson]]

*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Andre was a highly talented and accomplished [[broomstick]] flyer from an early age, quickly mastering various flying techniques during [[Flying (class)|Flying class]] and being proficient enough to be selected on the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]] as [[Keeper]]. Some at Hogwarts considered him the best [[Quidditch]] player in the school, which clearly shows his impressive skill in this [[magic]]al sport.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Andre was one of the most skilled students of Transfiguration of his year, alongside fellow Ravenclaws [[Talbott Winger]] and [[Tulip Karasu]], obtaining a passing grade in his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]] in the [[Transfiguration (class)|subject]]. He regularly participated in [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Rowan Khanna]] up front in Professor [[Minerva McGonagall|McGonagall's]] Transfiguration lessons.
*'''[[Muggle Studies]]''': Andre earned an O.W.L. in Muggle Studies and continued the subject at N.E.W.T. level.<ref name="HM73">{{HM|7|3}}</ref>

* '''Tailoring skills''': Andre was skilled at making his own clothing. He was inspired by Jacob's sibling and would often create outfits for them to wear to special events. He would usually make three different patterns and allow his friend to choose their favourite. Sometimes he also made clothes for others, like [[Ben Copper]] and [[Rowan Khanna]].  

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|Andre has a passion for Quidditch matched only by his passion for wizard fashion. He works hard, plays hard, and dresses the part.|Andre's character description|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
[[File:Andre's clothing item.jpg|155px|thumb|Pride Of Portree shirt]]

*In {{HM}}, Andre is unlocked as a friend upon the completion of Chapter 1 of Year 4.
**Upon reaching maximum friendship at level 10 with Andre, a unique clothing item is gifted to the player: a Pride of Portree shirt.
**He is one of the four characters (along with [[Merula Snyde]], [[Penny Haywood]], and [[Barnaby Lee]]) available as romance options for all four dating side quests: Celestial Ball, First Date, Valentine's Day, and Festival Fun. As with all other options, this can be done regardless of Jacob's sibling's gender.
*In {{HM}}, when [[Jacob's sibling]] needed to secure a [[broomstick]] to fly into the [[Forbidden Forest]], the player got to choose between Andre, [[Merula Snyde]], and [[Ismelda Murk]]. If Andre was chosen, his concern was that he might get kicked off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team, Jacob's sibling getting hurt, and his broom, given to him by [[Andre Egwu's grandmother|his grandmother]], getting broken.<ref name="yr4ch5" />
*During the [[Celestial Ball]] side quest, he says Charlie Weasley is usually everyone's favourite Quidditch player, and if he isn't, he should be. However, he also calls [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Erika Rath]] his favourite players in the 'Rivalry, Respect and Rath' side quest.
*In {{HM}}, when Jacob's sibling needed an additional helper alongside [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] and [[Sickleworth]] to search for the missing half of [[Torvus]]' family heirloom in the [[Forbidden Forest]], the player got to choose between Andre, [[Ben Copper]], and Ismelda Murk. If Andre was chosen, Charlie would respond having to always think it cool should they be on the same team, as they are both Qudditch players but for different House.<ref name="yr4ch10">{{HM|4|10}} {{c|info revealed if Andre was selected as the additional helper}}</ref>
**The statement may imply Andre being less likely a [[Seeker]], for it'd make little sense for Charlie to imagine them being on the same team were they both playing for the same position.
**Andre's actual Quidditch position was only revealed in Year 5, as Keeper.<ref name="owl" />
*His favourite colour is purple.
*His least favourite colour is pink.
