'''Vogel''' was an individual of unknown species and origin.<ref name="Vogel">[https://www.fantasticbeastsmovies.com/movies/fantastic-beasts-3/movie-3-what-we-know// What we know about Fantastic Beasts 3]</ref> 

==Etymology==
*"Vogel" is a surname in German and Dutch-speaking countries, and it also means "[[bird]]". 

==Behind the scenes==
*There are rumours that [[Oliver Masucci]]'s role in the {{SOD}} is Vogel. Masucci is German and Vogel is a German name. There is also the fact that Vogel has a [[Vogel's bodyguard|bodyguard]] listed as an extra played by [[Paul Parker]]. It would also be reasonable to assume that such a high ranking politician as the Head of the [[International Confederation of Wizards]] would have a bodyguard.
