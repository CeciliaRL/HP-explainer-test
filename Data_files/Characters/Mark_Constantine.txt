'''Mark Constantine''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] entrepreneur and the co-founder of the [[Lush]] cosmetics company. In July of [[1996]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Alistair Darling]] announced "controversial changes" to the [[capital gains tax]]. Mark Constantine told ''[[The Guardian]]'' that the measure would alienate the business community that [[Gordon Brown]], as Chancellor, had fought to attract to the [[Labour Party]].<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:TheGuardian.png|this image]])</ref>
