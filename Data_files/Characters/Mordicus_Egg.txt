==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that he was the [[Unidentified male Muggle Studies teacher|male Muggle Studies teacher]] replaced by [[Charity Burbage]], thus explaining both his knowledge of Muggles and his presence at Hogwarts. Another possibility is that he gained his title through his work at the [[Institute of Muggle Studies]].
*The portrait of an older Mordicus Egg appears in the Headmaster's Office indicating that he served at Headmaster of Hogwarts at some point. Alternatively, this portrait may be of a possible relative that shares the same name as the author Mordicus Egg.
