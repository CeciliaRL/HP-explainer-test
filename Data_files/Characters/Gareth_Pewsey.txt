'''Gareth Pewsey''' was a [[Hufflepuff]]<ref name="house" /> [[Wizardkind|student]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]]. He competed in the school [[Gobstones]] tournament during the [[1996–1997 school year]].

==Etymology==
The meaning of the name "Gareth" is unknown. It first appears in this form in Thomas Malory's 15th-century compilation of Arthurian legends ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', in which Gareth was a knight of the Round Table, the brother of Sir Gawain. Malory based the name on Gahariet, which was the name of a similar Arthurian character in French sources. It may ultimately have a Welsh origin, possibly related to gwaredd meaning "gentleness".
