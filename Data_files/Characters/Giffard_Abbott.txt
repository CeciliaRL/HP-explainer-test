'''Giffard Abbott''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], with several [[portrait]]s of him hanging in [[Hogwarts Castle]]. He had a male [[Giffard Abbott's dog|pet dog]] and seemed to have access to a source of food because fellow portrait [[Damara Dodderidge]] frequently asked him if he had any to give her.<ref name="OP">{{OOTP|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Lifetime===
Gifford Abbott was part of the Abbott family, which was one of the [[pure-blood]] families listed in the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]] directory in the [[1930s]].<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|pure-blood}}</ref> However, Giffard's actual [[blood status]] was unknown and may have been a [[half-blood]] individual within the pure-blood family, like some [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]], or a [[muggle-born]] wizard born into the family after the [[1930s]].<ref name="malfoy">{{WW|the-malfoy-family}}</ref>

Giffard would have attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth and was [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]] house.<ref name="house" /> Later in his adult life, he was appointed [[Headmaster]] of Hogwarts at an unknown point.<ref name="headmaster" />

===[[1992–1993 school year]]===
In early [[1993]], Giffard had a [[portrait]] of himself at the [[Grand Staircase]], hung immediately below the first-floor landing. As it was placed in an inaccessible place, it is unlikely he guarded any shortcut to another part of the school.<ref name="COSF 22">{{COS|F}} - Chapter 22 (''The Diary'')</ref>

===[[1995–1996 school year]]===
One of his portraits was hanging at the [[Grand Staircase]], guarding the shortcut to the [[Middle Courtyard|Transfiguration Courtyard]], under the password "''[[Dragon egg|Dragon's Egg]]''". When Abbott informed [[Harry Potter]] that he would need to ask a Hufflepuff student for the password in order to use his shortcut, Harry Potter had no difficulty doing this, as most Hufflepuffs had immense respect for him due to his loyalty to the late [[Cedric Diggory]] during the [[Triwizard Tournament]].<ref name="OP" /> There was another set of portraits of him, hiding another hidden passageway between the [[Clock Tower]] and the corridor outside the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]]; the password needed to gain access to this shortcut was "''Tempus neminem manet''".<ref name="OP GBA">{{OOTP|G}} - GBA version</ref>

===[[1996–1997 school year]]===
Giffard's portrait was moved to another landing of the [[Grand Staircase]], during the next school year. However, he still guarded a secret passage to the same place in the [[Middle Courtyard|Transfiguration Courtyard]]. Its password became "''Light Against Darkness''". He had a penchant for sighing wistfully, "Oh, to be young again!", when approached.<ref name="HBP">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Giffard died prior to early [[1993]], as the portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]] depict deceased individuals. His clothes indicate that he most likely lived during the [[Middle Ages]].
*It is possible that Abbott's portrait is a reference to [http://tudorhistory.org/people/charles5/charlesv.jpg a portrait] of [[Wikipedia:Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] of the Holy Roman Empire by Titian.

==Etymology==
