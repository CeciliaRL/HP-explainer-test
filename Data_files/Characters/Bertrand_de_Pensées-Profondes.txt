'''Bertrand de Pensées-Profondes''' was a [[France|French]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and a noted and highly-regarded [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] philosopher. He was the author of the celebrated work ''[[A Study into the Possibility of Reversing the Actual and Metaphysical Effects of Natural Death, with Particular Regard to the Reintegration of Essence and Matter]]''. He was sceptical of the concept of restoring the soul to a living body, remarking that it will never happen and people should accept death.<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|B}}</ref>
