A '''grandfather''' of [[Bartemius Crouch Senior]] owned an [[Axminster]] capable of seating twelve people prior to the ban on the use of [[flying carpet]]s in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]].<ref name="Mention">{{GOF|B|7}} - '''Barty Crouch Snr''': I remember my grandfather had an Axminster that could seat twelve - but that was before carpets were banned, of course.</ref> He may have been the father of [[Caspar Crouch]], and therefore the paternal grandfather of [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Sr]], although this has not been confirmed.
