'''Anne Boleyn''' (c. [[1501]] â€“ [[19 May]] [[1536]]) was [[Queen]] consort of [[England]] between [[1533]] and [[1536]], as the second wife of the notorious [[Henry VIII|King Henry VIII]], and mother to [[Elizabeth I|Queen Elizabeth I]] of England.<ref name="wikipedia">"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Boleyn Anne Boleyn]" on Wikipedia</ref>

Boleyn was accused by [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] of being a [[wizardkind|witch]].<ref name="wombat">Fifth question of the Third [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test|W.O.M.B.A.T.]] at {{JKRS}}.</ref> There may have been a popular [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] theory that she was instead a [[Squib]].<ref name="wombat" /> However, Anne's true blood status is unknown.

If Boleyn was indeed a Squib, it suggests her siblings could be magical. Notable direct descendants of Anne's sister Mary are Queen Elizabeth II and Diana, Princess of Wales. This could imply that they have magical blood along with descendants including Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.
