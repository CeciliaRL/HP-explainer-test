[[Belvina Black]] married [[Herbert Burke]], and they had three children: '''two sons''' and [[Belvina Burke's daughter|one daughter]]. They were all [[pure-blood]] and related through Belvina to the [[House of Black|Black family]].

These two [[Wizardkind|wizards]] were grandsons of famous [[Phineas Nigellus Black]], who was a [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. They likely attended the school.

They had a [[Belvina Burke's daughter|sister]].<ref name="BFT">''[[House of Black|Black family tree]]''</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
It is possible that one of the sons is Caractacus Burke, yet this is unconfirmed. However, this would mean that Caractacus could not possibly be the founder of [[Borgin and Burkes]] which would suggest that it was another relative; possibly [[Herbert Burke]], that founded the shop.
