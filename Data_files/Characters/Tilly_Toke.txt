==Biography==
===Holidaying in Ilfracombe===
[[File:Tilly_Toke-28-chocFrogCard.png|160px|thumb|left|Tilly Toke immortalised on a bronze [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]
Tilly had been holidaying with her family in [[Ilfracombe]], in [[Devon]] in [[1932]]. One day, a rogue [[Common Welsh Green]] [[dragon]] swooped down upon the beach, full of sunbathing [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]. Along with her family, Tilly fended off the attack, thus preventing any fatalities. The family then proceeded to perform "the largest batch of [[Memory Charm]]s this century" on the inhabitants of Ilfracombe.<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}} - ''Magical Beasts in Hiding''</ref>

The Toke family were all awarded [[Order of Merlin]], First Class, for their heroic actions in Ilfracombe.<ref name="FBR" /> She was also immortalised on a bronze [[Chocolate Frog Card]] for her achievement.<ref name="PSG"/>

===Postmortem===
In [[1993]], a Portrait of Tilly was hung at the first-floor corridor of Hogwarts Castle, protecting a secret area. A password was needed to access it. The password to said portrait was ''Dirigible''.<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Toke was shown to be proficient with the casting of the [[Memory Charm]], as she used it to erase the memories of numerous Muggles who witnessed a dragon at the [[Ilfracombe Incident]], which earned her an Order of Merlin first class award for her impressive work.<ref name="FBR"/>
