'''Rolf Scamander''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] in the employment of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' who followed the footprints of his [[Newton Scamander|famous grandfather]] and became a [[magizoologist]]. He [[Marriage|married]] the notable [[Dumbledore's Army]] member and [[Battle of Hogwarts]] combatant [[Luna Lovegood]]<ref name="mugglenet">[http://www.mugglenet.com/app/news/full_story/1156 JK Rowling Web Chat, 30th July] (archived)</ref> and had two sons by the name of [[Lorcan Scamander|Lorcan]] and [[Lysander Scamander|Lysander]].<ref name="unwritten">[[The unwritten story of Harry's friends and their children]] (Archived)</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Rolf was born into the wizarding [[Scamander family]] somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]]. Not much is known about Rolf's early life other than the fact that he was the grandson of [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] and his wife [[Porpentina Goldstein|Porpentina]]. He may have identified as [[Judaism|Jewish]], given that his grandmother was possibly a Jewish witch. 
 
At some point after he left school, he followed in the footsteps of his grandfather and went on to become a well-respected magizoologist. 

===Marriage===
Rolf eventually married [[Luna Lovegood]], a fellow naturalist.<ref name="mugglenet"/> According to [[Rita Skeeter]] (a dubious source), he had an unforgettably shocked expression when he saw Luna's [[Luna Lovegood's wedding dress|wedding dress]]. Her dress was decorated with rainbows and spangles, and she wore a tiara of silver unicorn horns. This dress was voted ‘[[Most Hideous Outfit of the Year]]' by readers of Skeeter's regular ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' column.<ref name="reunion"/> The couple had twin sons named [[Lorcan Scamander|Lorcan]] and [[Lysander Scamander|Lysander]].<ref name="unwritten" />

===Chief Consulting Magizoologist===
By the [[2010s]], Rolf Scamander was the [[Chief Consulting Magizoologist]] to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. It was in this capacity that he remarked about the [[Argentinian Council of Magic]]'s lack of foresight over the organisation of the opening ceremony of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]], which escalated into a fight between various team mascots prompted by an attempt to make the [[Fiji]]an [[Dukuwaqa]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Selma]] share a lake.<ref name=PM>{{PM}} - [[DISASTROUS OPENING CEREMONY LEADS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP SECURITY]] (Archived)</ref>

He also attended the final of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]] and sat in the VIP boxes with his wife, where he held an interesting conversation with [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] and held [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]]'s hands, which might have been because he was trying to prevent his wife from putting on one of her famous [[Special Event Hat]]s, according to [[Rita Skeeter]].

In [[2019]], he assisted prospective members of the then recently established [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] seeking a career as Magizoologists, to whom he shared the expertise passed down to him from his celebrated grandfather on how to understand the mind of the [[Erumpent]], as well as his research about [[Occamy|Occamies]], hoping it would help them in the field.<ref>{{WU}} ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCIfSWgMX-c&t=8s see video])</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magizoology]]''': Being a professional [[Magizoologist]] who worked as the [[Chief Consulting Magizoologist]] for the [[Daily Prophet]], Rolf was an expert in the study of [[magic]]al [[creature]]s, who covered various different creatures in his newspaper columns and would have had much knowledge of the creatures he covered. He also enjoyed exploring for strange new creatures with his wife and fellow Magizoologist [[Luna Lovegood]] across the globe. He was able to use his expertise knowledge and skill in this field to educate members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] in [[2019]] about how to understand and handle various [[beast]]s in their adventures.
*'''Journalism''': Being the [[Chief Consulting Magizoologist]] for the [[Daily Prophet]], Rolf was a highly talented and professional Journalist and a skilled newspaper reporter on various articles and events in his field. His pieces in the paper were both insightful and informative, showing he had a high degree of Journalistic integrity and that he took his career seriously.

==Relationships==
===Luna Lovegood===
[[Luna Lovegood|Luna]] was Rolf's wife, whom he had a very close and [[Love|loving]] relationship with. They were both professional [[Magizoologist]]s and both spent their time "globetrotting and looking for weird creatures". Rolf had two sons with Luna; both were born "considerably later" than the children of [[Harry Potter]] and their other friends.<ref>''[[J.K. Rowling: A Year in the Life]]''</ref>

==Etymology==
Rolf is a modern variant of the Norse name Hrolfr, which came from the German name Hrodulf (famous wolf). Rolf is formed from the words ''hrodr'' and ''ulf'', meaning "honour" and "wolf", respectively. His name therefore means "Honourable wolf". Rolf, being a form of Rudolph, would be related etymologically to the Potter name [[Rodolphus Lestrange]].

==Behind the scenes==
*It's unknown if he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].
*According to an interview with [[Evanna Lynch]] at the Oz Comic Con in Sydney in 2015, J. K. Rowling initially planned to introduce Rolf in {{DH}}, where he would have told [[The Tale of the Three Brothers]] to the Golden Trio. Ultimately, however, he was removed from the novel so that [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] could tell the story instead.<ref>[https://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/rolf-scamander-almost-added-to-deathly-hallows-book-admits-evanna-lynch-102015/ EXCLUSIVE: Rolf Scamander almost added to Deathly Hallows book, admits Evanna Lynch]</ref>
