==Etymology==
[[File:Regulus Black I.jpg|140px|thumb|left|Hesper's son [[Regulus Black I|Regulus]] on the family tree]]
''Hesper'' is an English variation of the name ''Esther''<ref>''[http://www.behindthename.com/name/hester Behind the Name: Hester]''</ref>, which is believed to be derived from the Persian word for "star," possibly an allusion to the naming pattern of the [[House of Black|family]] she married into.

The ''Book of Esther'' in the ''Old Testament'' tells the story of Queen [[Wikipedia:Esther|Esther]], the Jewish wife of the king of Persia who saved her people from extermination.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/esther Behind the Name: Esther]</ref>

It's also possible that her name derives from [[wikipedia:Hesperus|Hesperus]], the "Evening Star" from Greek mythology (Vesper for the Romans). This was a name assigned to the planet Venus, visible during the evening, whose morning counterpart ("Morning Star") would become called "Lucifer" in Latin.<ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer Lucifer] on Wikipedia</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The person who discovered [[Gamp's Law of Elemental Transfiguration]] might have been related to Hesper.
*She shares her name with [[Hesper Black]].
*On one version of the Black family tree designed by [[MinaLima Design]] for the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], as seen [https://minalima.com/product/black-family-tapestry/ here], the name "Gamp" was misspelled "Gemp".
