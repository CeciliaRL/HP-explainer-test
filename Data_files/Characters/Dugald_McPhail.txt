'''Minister Dugald McPhail''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]]. A [[Hufflepuff]] in his [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] years, he rose to the office of [[Minister for Magic]], serving from [[1858]] to [[1865]].<ref name="pottermore">{{PM}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Dugald McPhail was born on an unknown date, no later than [[1841]],<ref>In order to have been appointed Minister for Magic in [[1858]], McPhail would have had to be out of Hogwarts and thus at least 17 at that point, placing his earliest birth year in [[1841]] — although it is unlikely someone that young would become Minister for Magic.</ref> to at least one magical parent. His surname, coupled with the fact that he spoke in a heavy Scottish brogue, implies he was from [[Scotland]], or had Scottish ancestry.

In his youth, he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

===As Minister for Magic===
McPhail was appointed [[Minister for Magic]], sometime after leaving Hogwarts, from [[1858]] to [[1865]].<ref name="pottermore"/>.  He was elected Minister at least once, perhaps twice.

During his time as Minister, McPhail came up with the idea of mimicking the then-new [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] bus service to provide underage and infirm [[wizardkind|witches and wizards]] with a discreet method of transportation, leading to the introduction of the [[Knight Bus]] in [[1865]].<ref name="Knight Bus">{{WW|the-knight-bus}}</ref>

His overall term in office was viewed as "successful" by [[Gabriel Truman]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="pottermore" />

===Legacy===
On [[1 September]], [[1991]], [[Prefect]] [[Gabriel Truman]] welcomed the [[Hufflepuff]] [[first year]]s to [[Hufflepuff Basement]] with a short speech in which he mentioned former Minister Dugald McPhail as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who were [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]], like them, into Hufflepuff.<ref name="pottermore" />
