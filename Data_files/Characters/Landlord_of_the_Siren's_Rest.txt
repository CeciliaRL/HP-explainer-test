The '''Siren's Rest's landlord''' was the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] owner of the [[Siren's Rest]] pub.

==Biography==
[[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and [[Mathilda Grimblehawk|her partner]] investigated his story of bring attacked by a 50-foot-long [[magic]]al [[beast]] while fishing in the [[Lake in Wales|nearby lake]]. [[Landlord of the Siren's Rest's fishing pole|His fishing pole]] bore the marks of the magical beast which he hoped would help draw patrons to his pub. [[Landlord of the Siren's Rest's spectacles|His spectacles]], which he lost during the encounter, were later retrieved by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] investigators at the bottom of the lake, with marks of suckers on them.

When visiting monster hunter [[Laura Thorn]] went missing he drew a map and rounded up some local lads to go find her.<ref name="FBC4.3">{{FBC|4|3}}</ref> After [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] investigators [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and [[Mathilda Grimblehawk|her partner]] (in the guise of people from "the lake safety commission") retrieved Thorn and sent her to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], the Landlord agreed to call off the Muggle mob, but expressed his intention to contact the newspapers with information about [[Grindylow|the monster]] from the lake (his ultimate goal to "''make a fortune off monster-seeking tourists''"). Ultimately, he had to be [[Memory Charm|Obliviated]] to prevent a breach of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]].<ref name="FBC4.4">{{FBC|4|4}}</ref>
