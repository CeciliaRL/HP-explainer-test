'''Professor Regulus Moonshine''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who developed a [[Regulus Moonshine's potion|potion]] to suppress [[hag]]s' normal appetite for [[human]] [[flesh]]. He lost several chunks of own body while conducting the clinical trials.<ref name="DP">{{DP}} [[1 October]], [[1999]], Page 1</ref>

An article in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' called him "Professor",<ref name="DP"/> but it is not known if he ever taught at a [[wizarding school]], like [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Moonshine was evidently a talented [[potioneer]], given how he successfully developed a [[Regulus Moonshine's potion|potion]] to suppress the [[human]] [[flesh]]-eating tendencies of [[hag]]s.<ref name="DP"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Regulus" is a Roman cognomen which meant "rule" in Latin. This was the name of several early saints. Moonshine, also known as white lightning, mountain dew, hooch or Tennessee white whiskey, is a high-proof distilled spirit, generally produced illicitly.
