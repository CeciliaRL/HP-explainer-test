This '''fiery individual''' (d. [[2 May]], [[1998]]) was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].
==Biography==
This [[Dark Wizard]] was born sometime in or before 1981, into either a [[Pure-blood|pure]] or [[half-blood]] family, presumably in [[Great Britain]].

He was trained in the [[magic]]al arts sometime before [[1998]], most likely at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], given that he fought in a battle that year and had became a follower and servant of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], an immensely powerful [[Dark Wizard]] sometime before then. Being a Death Eater, he would have been highly accomplished in the [[Dark Arts]]. 

This person, toward the end of the battle, was [[Fire-Making Spell|set ablaze]] and [[Everte Statum|thrown]] across the length of the [[Great Hall]] to the floor; he very likely died of his injuries.<ref>{{DH|F2}}</ref>
==Behind the scenes==
*He could, really, be any of the unidentified Death Eaters, given that he was only seen for a few moments and was engulfed in [[Fire|flame]] for that time.
