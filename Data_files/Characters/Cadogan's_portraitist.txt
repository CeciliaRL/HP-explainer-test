This [[Wizardkind|wizard]] '''portraitist''' (fl. [[Middle Ages]]) was responsible for creating the [[portrait]] of [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]] that would eventually be hung in [[Hogwarts Castle]]. The portrait was composed of both Cadogan and [[Cadogan's pony|his pony]] on a vibrant landscape. As the portraitist interpreted Cadogan as a fairly unbalanced [[Wizardkind|wizard]], constantly looking for a fight and falling from his [[horse]], this was how the portrait acted upon its completion.<ref name="PM">{{WW|hogwarts-portraits}}</ref>
