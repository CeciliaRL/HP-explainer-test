'''Septimus Malfoy''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who lived during the late [[18th century]]. He was influential in the [[Ministry of Magic]], and many claimed that when he served as an [[Advisor to the Minister for Magic|advisor]], the [[Minister for Magic]] [[Unctuous Osbert]] was little more than his puppet.<ref name="PM">{{WW|the-malfoy-family}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Septimus is a [[Latin]] word for "seventh." This naming may be an attempt to draw reference to the powerful [[magic]]al properties of the number [[seven]].

==Behind the scenes==
*In [[1992]], [[Harry Potter]], speaking about [[Draco Malfoy]], said, ''"Look at his family... The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin, he's always boasting about it"''.<ref>{{COS|B|9}}</ref> This indicates that Septimus was most likely a [[Slytherin]] if he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], though it cannot be confirmed.
*In [[1997]] a [[Unidentified portrait in Malfoy Manor (II)|portrait]] was hung in [[Malfoy Manor]] showing a wizard; Septimus may be that wizard.
*Oddly, Septimus is a [[Septimus Weasley|name]] that also appears on the [[Weasley family]] tree, an almost rival family of the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] in later years.
*The relationship between Septimus and Unctuous Osbert is similar to that of his descendent [[Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Cornelius Fudge]].
