==Etymology==
The name "Terrence" is from the Roman family name ''Terentius'' which is of unknown meaning. Famous bearers include Publius Terentius Afer, a Roman playwright, and Marcus Terentius Varro, a Roman scholar. It was also borne by several early saints. The name was used in Ireland as an anglicised form of ''Toirdhealbhack'', but it was not in use as an English name until the late 19th century.
