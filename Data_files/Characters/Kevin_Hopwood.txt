'''Kevin Hopwood''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was made the [[Gobstones Tournament|Gobstones World Champion]] at some point. Due to the lack of popularity the game of [[Gobstones]] has been having in latest years, the [[National Gobstone Association]] has attempted a recruitment campaign, "''[[Give Gobstones A Second Glance]]''", and issued a poster with an accompanying picture of Hopwood being squirted with an eyeful of gunk.<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|gobstones}}</ref>
