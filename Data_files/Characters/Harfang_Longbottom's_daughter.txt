The '''only daughter''' of [[Harfang Longbottom]] and [[Callidora Black]] was a [[pure-blood]] witch.<ref name="BFT">[[House of Black|Black family tree]]</ref>. She had [[Harfang Longbottom's son|a brother]]. She was a first cousin of [[Arthur Weasley]] and possibly [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Bartemius Crouch Snr]] through her mother. She was also possibly related to [[Frank Longbottom]] and his [[Neville Longbottom|son]] through her father.

==Behind the scenes==
*Nothing else is known about her. Initially, it was speculated that she was actually Neville's great-aunt [[Enid Longbottom|Enid]], although this was not the case, as Enid was more of an affinity relative of the [[Longbottom family|Longbottoms]], being the wife of Neville's great-uncle [[Algie Longbottom]].
