==Biography==
Creaseworthy lived during the [[17th century]].<ref name="HPLE" /> During her life, she earned the title "Dame,"<ref name="mhop" /> the female equivalent of the honour of [[knight]]hood in [[Great Britain]].<ref name="damewiki">"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dame_%28title%29 Dame (title)]" on Wikipedia</ref>
