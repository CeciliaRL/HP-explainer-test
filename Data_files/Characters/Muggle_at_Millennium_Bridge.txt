This '''[[Non-magic people|Muggle]] woman''' was on the [[Millennium Bridge]] when it was destroyed by [[Death Eaters]] in [[1996]]. As the bridge collapsed, the woman ran for her life. It is unknown what happened to her afterwards.<ref name="HBPF">{{HBP|F}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*She was portrayed by [[Ninette Finch]] in {{HBP|FA}}.
*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, there were no [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] on the [[Millennium Bridge]] during its destruction, so the woman was omitted from the game.
