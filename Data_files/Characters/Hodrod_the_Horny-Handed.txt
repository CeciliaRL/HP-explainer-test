'''Hodrod the Horny-Handed''' was a [[goblin]] activist who [[Goblin magic|shrunk]] three [[Wizardkind|wizards]] and then tried to crush them.<ref>[[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test]]: Test Three</ref> The [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] arrested him for these actions. This did not sit well with the goblin community, because when the [[Brotherhood of Goblins]] met with representatives from the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] in [[Chipping Clodbury]], they demanded that he be released.<ref>[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[1 June]], [[1999]], Page 1</ref>

Hodrod was also mentioned in a question on the third [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test|W.O.M.B.A.T. test]], which gave his imprisonment as one of several possible motivations for the [[Goblin Rebellions]] of the [[17th century|17th]] and [[18th century|18th centuries]]. This answer is obviously a red herring, because the [[Chipping Clodbury riot|Chipping Clodbury Riot]] occurred at least two centuries later, in [[1999]].
