'''Queen Maeve''' was a famous [[Ireland|Irish]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived during the [[Middle Ages]]. 

==Biography==
Prior to the establishment of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], she was involved in the training of young [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] in her native [[Ireland]]. She was immortalised on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Her title may indicate she was [[Muggle-born]] or [[Half-blood]], as [[Remus Lupin]] mentioned there are no princes in the [[wizarding world]]<ref name="HBP16">{{HBP|B|16}}</ref> and thus, probably no queens or it means that she married a [[Non-magic people|muggle]] king.

==Etymology==
The name "Maeve" is the anglicised form of the Gaelic name [[Wikipedia:Medb|Medb]] meaning "intoxicating". In Irish legend this was the name of a warrior queen of Connacht. Her fight against Ulster and the hero Cúchulainn is told in the Irish epic 'The Cattle Raid of Cooley'.
