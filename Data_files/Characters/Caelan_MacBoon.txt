'''Caelan MacBoon''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Quintius MacBoon]]'s nephew. According to legend, Quintius killed the head of the [[McClivert clan]], [[Dugald McClivert]] in a drunken [[Duelling|duel]]. The [[death]] led to the McClivert clan [[Transfiguration|transfiguring]] the MacBoons into extremely dangerous [[flesh]]-eating [[beast]]s known as [[Quintaped]]s, presumably including Caelan.<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>
