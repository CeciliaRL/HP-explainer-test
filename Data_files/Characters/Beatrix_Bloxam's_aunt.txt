The '''aunt''' of [[Beatrix Bloxam]] had [[Beatrix Bloxam's cousins|children]] who were older than her niece. 
When she was young, Beatrix listened at a keyhole and was disturbed to hear this aunt tell her children [[The Warlock's Hairy Heart]], as well as parts of a shocking tale involving Beatrix's uncle [[Nobby]], a [[hag]] who lived in the area, and a sack of [[Bouncing Bulb]]s.<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|H}}</ref>

It is unlikely that Beatrix's aunt was married to her uncle Nobby, as she probably wouldn't have chosen to tell her children a scandalous story about their father, particularly not one of the nature implied.
