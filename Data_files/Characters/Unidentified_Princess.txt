This '''Princess''' was the daughter of a [[Unidentified King|monarch]] of a land during the [[Middle Ages]]. [[Leticia Somnolens]], the local [[Hag]], was jealous of this princess and tricked the Princess into pricking her finger on a spindle tainted with a [[Draught of Living Death]], sending her into a deep sleep. A [[Unidentified young wizard|young wizard]] smeared his lips with [[Wiggenweld Potion]], and then kissed the princess, curing her and bringing her out of the sleep.<ref>{{POA|G}}</ref> Her story appears to be the source of inspiration for the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] fairy tale, [[Sleeping Beauty]].
