}}'''Ellen Cracknell''' was the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] mother of [[Dolores Umbridge]].<ref name="PM">{{PM}} - [https://www.pottermore.com/explore-the-story/dolores-umbridge New from J.K. Rowling: Dolores Umbridge]</ref>

==Biography==
Ellen Cracknell married the [[Wizardkind|wizard]] [[Orford Umbridge]], and together they had two children: a daughter, [[Dolores Umbridge|Dolores]], and a son who was born a [[Squib]].

The marriage was not a happy one. Orford blamed Ellen for the birth of their Squib son, and Dolores came to loathe her mother not only for her [[Muggle]] heritage but also her flightiness and untidiness.<ref name="PM" />

When Dolores was fifteen, the tension between Ellen and Orford came to a head and the pair separated. While her ex-husband and daughter continued to live in the [[wizarding world]], Ellen and her son returned to the [[Muggle world]]. Ellen would never see her daughter again.<ref name="PM" />
