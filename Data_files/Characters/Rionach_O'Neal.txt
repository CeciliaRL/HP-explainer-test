Rionach was seen passing by [[Harry Potter]] and [[Cho Chang]], when a commotion broke out as [[Dolores Umbridge]] attempted to [[Order of Dismissal|dismiss]] [[Sybill Trelawney]].<ref>See the following six frames of this sequence: [https://i2.wp.com/caps.pictures/200/7-harry-potter-order-phoenix/full/order-of-the-phoenix-movie-screencaps.com-5775.jpg 1], [https://i2.wp.com/caps.pictures/200/7-harry-potter-order-phoenix/full/order-of-the-phoenix-movie-screencaps.com-5776.jpg 2], [https://i1.wp.com/caps.pictures/200/7-harry-potter-order-phoenix/full/order-of-the-phoenix-movie-screencaps.com-5777.jpg 3], [https://i1.wp.com/caps.pictures/200/7-harry-potter-order-phoenix/full/order-of-the-phoenix-movie-screencaps.com-5778.jpg 4], [https://i1.wp.com/caps.pictures/200/7-harry-potter-order-phoenix/full/order-of-the-phoenix-movie-screencaps.com-5779.jpg 5], and [https://i1.wp.com/caps.pictures/200/7-harry-potter-order-phoenix/full/order-of-the-phoenix-movie-screencaps.com-5780.jpg 6]</ref>

By this school year, she had entered into a [[Love|romantic]] relationship and had kissed the boy in question in the halls of [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]] on at least one occasion; however, [[Professor]] Umbridge had [[Revulsion Jinx|forced them apart]] when she saw them.<ref>[https://www.spotlight.com/interactive/cv/1/F174618.html Actress Marianne Chase's Spotlight profile] - "Feature Film, Kissing Couple (Girl), HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, Warner Bros, David Yates"</ref>

===Later years===
Rionach attended the school in the [[1996–1997 school year]] when [[Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] was killed at the hands of [[Severus Snape|another teacher]]. Then [[1997–1998 school year|the next year]], she continued to attend the school, despite it having fallen under [[Death Eaters]]' control. It's unknown whether she fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] or evacuated before the fight began.<ref name="appearances" />

==Physical appearance==
Rionach had fair skin and a good complexion. She had long dark brown hair, which she kept in two {{w|French braid}}s during the [[1995–1996 school year]]. She was tall and willowy.

==Etymology==
Rionach is a variant of the Irish ''Ríoghnach'', which means "queen". O'Neal is a form of the Irish [[Gaelic]] ''Ua Néill'', meaning "grandson/descendant of Niall".

==Behind the scenes==
*Rionach O'Neal was portrayed by [[Marianne Chase]] in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]]. Chase was initially only credited as O'Neal for ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]],'' with most of her other appearances credited as "Gryffindor Student". However, her Mandy profile was later updated to state she played the same character in her subsequent appearances.<ref name="appearances" />
*What Rionach did in every film is unknown, apart from her confirmed appearance in them. Exceptions being ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Order of the Phoenix]]''.
**In {{POA|FA}}, Rionach was a [[Chaser]] for the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] during [[Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff Quidditch match (1993)|the match]] against [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team|Hufflepuff]]. She visited the [[Hospital Wing]] after the match, as [[Harry Potter]] and another team member were injured, and was seen at the bedside of the unknown team member.<ref>[https://mobile.twitter.com/MarianneEAChase/status/1122842804479299589 Yes! It is me!] by [https://twitter.com/MarianneEAChase Marianne Chase on Twitter]</ref>
***This particular appearance of Rionach's is not [[canon]], since every player in the team, including the three Chasers ([[Katie Bell]], [[Angelina Johnson]] and [[Alicia Spinnet]]), are known in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|book]], with Rionach not being one of them.
**In {{OOTP|FA}}, Rionach is recognised in three scenes, including her kissing scene.
**Rionach had an unknown but confirmed appearance as a student in {{DH|F1}} and {{DH|F2}}, but it's unknown whether she fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] or evacuated.
