==Biography==
===Brigade of Witch-Hunters===
{{Quote|...commanded the head of his army to form a Brigade of Witch-Hunters, and issued them with a pack of ferocious black hounds|The [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
The [[King (Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump)|King]] wanted all the magic in the world for himself, so he created the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters]] to gather all the [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]]. Sabre was among the ferocious black hounds that were given to the Brigade to help them doing this task, being the largest of them.<ref name="TBB" />

===Death===
{{Quote|[[King (Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump)|Your Majesty]], this very morning, Sabre died of eating a poisonous toadstool!|Captain of the Brigade of Witch-Hunters|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
Possibly while looking for [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] with the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters|Brigade]], Sabre found a poisonous toadstool and ate it. He died shortly after, for the Captain of the Brigade's displeasure.<ref name="TBB" />

===The King's "magic"===
{{Quote|Bring him back to life, Your Majesty, with your wand!|Captain of the Brigade of Witch-Hunters|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
A [[Charlatan|Muggle Charlatan]] was fooling the [[King (Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump)|King]], pretending to be teaching him magic, while the King gave him many of his treasures. One day, the King wanted to perform his "magic" before a crowd of lords and ladies of the court. [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]], the King's washerwoman was a real witch, so the [[Charlatan]] placed her behind a bush, performing the magic, while the King simply waved his twig. When the Captain of the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters]] arrived, he showed Sabre's lifeless body to the King, begging him to bring him back to life. The foolish King brandished his twig and pointed it at the dead dog. But inside the bush, [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] did nothing, because she knew that [[Necromancy|no magic can raise the dead]].<ref name="TBB" />
