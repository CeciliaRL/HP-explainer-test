This '''[[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]]''' came into [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] in [[1995]] because a [[magic]]al [[creature]] had taken a bite out of her leg but she also refused to tell the [[Healer]]s what it was that bit her. This made the other patients think that she may have been illegally handling a [[creature]]. [[Arthur Weasley]] noted that the bite smelt highly unpleasant whenever the dressings were taken off.<ref name="OOTP22">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref>

Her bed in St Mungo's was near the door of the Dai Llewellyn Ward when [[Harry Potter]], [[Alastor Moody|Mad-Eye Moody]], [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and the [[Weasley family]] went to see [[Arthur Weasley]].<ref name="OOTP22"/>
