'''Jules Egwu''' was a '''[[Wizardkind|witch]]''' and a cousin of [[Andre Egwu]].<ref name="HM3">{{HM|3|A SCANDAL IN HOGSMEADE}}</ref>

==Biography==
She was homeschooled, instead of attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], as her family moved constantly due to [[Jules Egwu's parents|her parents]] jobs as [[Magizoologist]]s.<ref name="HM3"/>

By the [[1986–1987 school year]], she had travelled around the world with her parents. She had lived in [[China]], [[India]] and the [[Mediterranean]], and had been to fifty-two countries including a trip to the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]]. 

Jules also had an interest in [[magic]]al creatures. She and her parents rehabilitated a baby [[Granian]] with a broken wing. She once stumbled on a patch of [[Cobra Lily|Cobra Lilies]], barely made it out alive. She saw an [[Occamy]] grow and shrink while defending its [[Occamy egg|silver eggs]]. Once Jules hid from a [[graphorn]] in the [[Austria]]n [[Alps]].<ref name="HM3" />

As a young girl, she was very shy and uncertain around people and had difficulty making friends. This was mainly due to her family's constant movements. She considered the [[Demiguise]] her favourite magical creature as it could become invisible at will. In her shyness she believed it would be better if she could make herself permanently invisible because no one would be interested in being friends her.

However, as she got older she became more confident. This was due in large part to her interactions with her cousin Andre- seeing how comfortable he was with himself gave her the courage to be herself. 

During the [[1986–1987 school year]] she was living in [[Japan]] while her parents were there, hoping to observe an [[Oni]]. Some time that year, she visited her cousin in [[Hogsmeade]].<ref name="HM3"/>

At around that time [[Unidentified Demiguise|a Demiguise]] had somehow made its way to Hogsmeade and began stealing various sweets from the area around the village. Jules and Andre along with Andre's friends, [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Penny Haywood]], managed to capture the creature. Jules decided to take it with her when she returned to Japan, as it was part of the creature's natural habitat range, and ask her parents to find a suitable place to release it.<ref name="HM3" />
