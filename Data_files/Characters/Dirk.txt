'''"Dodgy" Dirk''' (fl. [[1932]] — [[1972]]) was an [[England|English]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] who lived in [[Ilfracombe Incident|Ilfracombe]], notable for eluding the mass [[Memory Charm]]s after witnessing the [[Ilfracombe Incident]] of [[1932]].<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>

==Biography==
In [[1932]], a [[Common Welsh Green]] [[dragon]] descended upon a crowded beach in [[Ilfracombe]], attacking a group of sunbathers, among which was Dirk, who had his lilo pierced by the [[beast]]. By sheer chance, the [[Wizardkind|wizard]]ing [[Tilly Toke|Toke]] family was on the beach during the attack, and managed to protect the beach-goers, and proceeding to perform a multitude of [[Memory Charm]]s in order to make the [[Non-magic people|non-magical folk]] forget about the attack. 

However, Dirk somehow managed to evade the [[Memory Charm]]s, and went on for at least forty years afterwards frequenting bars along the south coast of [[England]], talking about the day a ''"dirty great flying [[lizard]]"'' poked a hole in his [[Wikipedia:Air mattress|lilo]], gaining the nickname "Dodgy" Dirk. 

[[Blenheim Stalk]] mentioned this in his [[1972]] book ''[[Muggles Who Notice]]''.<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>

== Behind the Scenes ==
The name "Li-lo" was registered as a product trademark in the UK on 19 April 1944, making its use describing an incident in 1932 possibly anachronistic; however Dirk may have taken to calling it this after the term entered common use.
