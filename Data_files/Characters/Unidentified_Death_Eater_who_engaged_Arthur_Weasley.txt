In [[1998]], he was present during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].

There, he killed [[Unidentified wizard killed at the Quad battlements|a wizard]] and [[Duelling|duelled]] with [[Arthur Weasley]]; he with a [[Killing Curse]] and Arthur with either a [[Stunning Spell]] or [[Disarming Charm]]. The outcome of the duel was unknown, same as the fate of this individual; though given that Arthur survived the Battle of Hogwarts, it was likely that the individual was either killed, disarmed, defeated or had abandoned the Battle and Voldemort along with many other Death Eaters.<ref>{{DH|F2}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, this [[Wizardkind|wizard]] would have been very proficient in the dark arts, and was able to kill another wizard effortlessly with the [[Killing Curse]]. He was highly likely to have been skilled in casting the other [[Unforgivable Curses]] along with other [[dark charm]]s and spells.  
*'''[[Duelling]]''': This wizard was clearly a very skilled and accomplished duellist, as he fought against numerous other wizards and even Arthur Weasley in the Battle of Hogwarts.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': This wizard could cast a nonverbal Killing Curse, a mark of superior [[Magic|magical]] skill given the difficulty of casting non-verbal spells and the Killing Curse itself.  
*'''[[Apparition]]''': This wizard was capable of apparating.

==Behind the scenes==
*This individual may be the [[Unidentified Male Death Eater (I)|man that sat next to]] [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in [[Malfoy Manor]].
