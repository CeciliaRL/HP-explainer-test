'''Patrick Fincher''' was a [[Ravenclaw]] [[Wizardkind|student]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]]. He played informal [[Quidditch]] matches with other students during the [[1996â€“1997 school year]].

==Etymology==
The name "Patrick" is from the Latin name Patricius, which meant "nobleman". This name was adopted in the 5th-century by Saint Patrick, whose birth name was Sucat. He was a Romanized Briton who was captured and enslaved in his youth by Irish raiders. After six years of servitude he escaped home, but he eventually became a bishop and went back to Ireland as a missionary. He is traditionally credited with Christianizing the island, and is regarded as Ireland's patron saint.
