'''Nobby''' was the uncle of [[Beatrix Bloxam]]. When Beatrix was a child, she overheard her [[Beatrix Bloxam's aunt|aunt]] tell her [[Beatrix Bloxam's cousins|cousins]] about a "dreadfully unsavoury affair" that involved Nobby, the local [[hag]], and a sack of [[Bouncing Bulb]]s. This may have contributed to her problems with sleepwalking.<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|H}}</ref>

==Etymology==
'''Nobby''' is a nickname for [[Norberta|Norbert]] or Nob [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobby] [http://www.memidex.com/nobby]. The word '''nobby''' means ''stylish'', however the name could have also been derived from the word ''nob'', which is a slang word for the head, or a reference to a person of wealth and high social status.

==Behind the scenes==
*It is unlikely that Nobby was married to the aunt eavesdropped on by Beatrix. This aunt chose to discuss Nobby's scandalous behaviour with her children and probably would not have done so if Nobby had been their father.
