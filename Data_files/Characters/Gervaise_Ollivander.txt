{{Quote|You will never fool the cedar carrier.|Gervaise Ollivander|Pottermore}}
'''Gervaise Ollivander''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] who came from a [[Ollivander family|long line]] of [[wandmaker]]s who had [[Ollivanders|operated]] in [[Diagon Alley]] since his earliest ancestors arrived in [[England]]  with the Romans, and set up stall (subsequently shop) to sell to ancient British wizards. He was the son of [[Gerbold Ollivander|Gerbold Octavius Ollivander]], and the father of [[Garrick Ollivander]].<ref name="pottermore">{{PM}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gervaise Ollivander was born before [[1890]] likely<ref name="birth" />, somewhere in [[Great Britain]]. He was born into the [[wizardkind|wizarding]] [[Ollivander family]], who had been in the [[Ollivanders|wand-making business]] since [[B.C. era|382 B.C]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

===Career as a wandmaker===
{{Quote|Early in my career, as I watched my wandmaker father wrestling with substandard wand core materials such as kelpie hair, I conceived the ambition to discover the finest cores and to work only with those when my time came to take over the family business. This I have done.|[[Garrick Ollivander]].|Pottermore}}
Gervaise took up the [[Ollivanders|family business]] in [[London]], studying further into [[wandlore]] and becoming an accomplished wandmaker.<ref name="pottermore"/>

He and [[Garrick Ollivander's mother|his wife]], a [[Muggle-born]] witch, had at least one child, [[Garrick Ollivander|Garrick]] sometime in, or prior to, [[1909]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

According to Gervaise, it was impossible to fool a wizard or witch who carried a wand of [[cedar]] wood, an opinion that [[Garrick Ollivander|his son]] shared.<ref name="pottermore"/>

As it was practise at the time, a customer would often present the wandmaker with a magical substance to which they were attached, or had inherited, or by which their family swore.<ref name="pottermore"/> As such, Gervaise used a wide variety of [[wand core]]s. Early in his career, his son [[Garrick Ollivander|Garrick]] saw his father working with substandard wand core materials such as [[kelpie]] hair, [[kneazle]] whisker and [[Troll whisker]]. It was then that he conceived the ambition to work with only the finest cores, and thus discover the ideal wand.<ref name="pottermore"/>
