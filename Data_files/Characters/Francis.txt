{{Quote|T'was a student who gave me Francis... One spring afternoon I discovered a bowl on my desk, just a few inches of clear water in it. Floating on the surface was a flower petal... as I watched, it sank... just before it reached the bottom, it was transformed, into a wee fish. It was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold. The flower petal had come from a lily... your mother. The day I came downstairs, the day the bowl was empty, was the day your mother...|[[Horace Slughorn]] regarding his pet fish Francis to [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)}}
'''Francis''' was the name of a pet fish owned by [[Horace Slughorn]].<ref name="HBPF"/>

==Biography==
[[File:Horace_Slughorn.jpg|120px|thumb|left|Horace Slughorn, Francis' owner]]
It was originally a [[lily]] petal which [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] had [[Piscifors|transfigured]]Â into piscine form during her studying years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="HBPF"/>

The fish came into Slughorn's possession when Lily set the petal to float inside a bowl filled with [[water]]. When Slughorn found his gift, the petal sank down in the bowl and [[Transformation|turned]] into Francis, much to the [[Professor]]'s delight. Slughorn kept Francis for many years, until the morning of [[1 November]], [[1981]], when he found Francis had disappeared. This was due to Lily's [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|death]] at the hands of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].<ref name="HBPF"/>
