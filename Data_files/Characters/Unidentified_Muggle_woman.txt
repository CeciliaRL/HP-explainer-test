{{Quote|Ernie, little old lady at twelve o'clock!|The [[Dre Head|Shrunken Head]] warns [[Ernest Prang|Ernie Prang]]|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)}}
This elderly '''Muggle woman''' lived in [[London]] in the early [[1990s]].<ref name="POAF3"/>

==Biography==
In [[August]] [[1993]], this elderly woman was almost run over by the [[Knight Bus]], in which [[Harry Potter]] had been travelling at the time, whilst she was crossing a [[London]] street, with the support of her zimmer-frame. Due to [[Dre Head]]'s warning, the bus, driven by [[Ernest Prang|Ernie Prang]], narrowly avoided hitting her by stopping at the last moment. [[Dre Head]] counted back from ten (including three and a half and one and three quarters) to give Ernie Prang the exact second to take off once more.<ref name="POAF3">{{POA|F}} - Chapter 3 (''The Knight Bus'')</ref>
