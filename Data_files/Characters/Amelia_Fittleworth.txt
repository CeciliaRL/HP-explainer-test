'''Amelia Fittleworth''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Hufflepuff]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}} - NDS only</ref>

==Biography==
During the [[1996–1997 school year]], she could usually be found in the [[Owlery]], as she liked to watch the [[owl]]s there (of which [[Hedwig]], the snowy owl owned by [[Harry Potter]], was one of her favourites). [[Rubeus Hagrid]] gave her the last of his [[rose oil]] for an unknown reason, but as Harry Potter needed it to give to [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], she agreed to trade it with him for four [[Fanged Frisbee]]s.<ref name="HBPG"/>

She presumably came from either a [[pure-blood]] or [[half-blood]] background, as she initially had no idea what a hairdryer was, and upon learning what it did, expressed the opinion, ''"[[Non-magic people|Muggles]] have so many strange things."''<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Amelia" is a variant of Amalia, though it is sometimes confused with Emilia, which has a different origin. The name became popular in England after the German House of Hanover came to the British throne in the 18th century - it was borne by daughters of George II and George III. Another famous bearer was Amelia Earhart (1897–1937), the first woman to make a solo flight over the Atlantic Ocean.
