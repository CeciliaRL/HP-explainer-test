{{Quote|Ran inter a couple o' mad [[troll]]s on the [[Poland|Polish]] border an' I had a sligh' disagreement with a [[vampire]] in [[Minsk]].|[[Rubeus Hagrid]] on his encounter with the vampire|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
This '''[[vampire]]''' had a disagreement with the [[half-giant]] [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in a pub in [[Minsk]] in the summer of [[1995]].<ref name="OOTP20">{{OOTP|B|20}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The way Hagrid explained the encounter suggests that the 'disagreement' was a fight of some kind, however, this was not confirmed.
*The fact that this vampire was in {{wplink|Belarus}} in Eastern Europe may be a reference to the fact that vampires such as Dracula are traditionally said to haunt this area.
