'''Professor Nerida Vulchanova''' was the great [[Bulgaria]]n [[Wizardkind|witch]] who founded [[Durmstrang Institute]], serving as its first [[Headmaster|Headmistress]],<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|durmstrang-institute}}</ref> in the Middle Ages.

==Biography==
At some point, Vulchanova suffered a mysterious [[death]], and shortly afterwards [[Harfang Munter]] took over the school, in what was later to be considered a dark period in the history of the school: Munter substantially altered the curriculum to focus on [[duelling]] and [[martial magic]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{GOF|FA}}, the Durmstrang Institute is portrayed as an all male school. However according to {{PM}}, the school was founded by Nerida Vulchanova; a witch. In {{GOF}}, at least one [[Durmstrang girl|female]] is known to have attend Durmstrang during the [[1994-1995 school year]]. Therefore, according to the books, the school is in fact co-ed, just like Hogwarts. 

==Etymology==
*''Nerida'' is an uncommon variant of the female Nereida (Spanish, Greek) or Nerine (Greek), which can be translated as ''sea nymph''.
