{{Quote|Uric was a strange wizard who lived in ancient times. Among other things, he was famous for wearing a jellyfish as a hat. No one knows if he meant to become the weirdest wizard of the ages or if it just came naturally.|[[Chocolate Frog Card]]|Chocolate Frog Cards}}
'''Uric the Oddball''' was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[wizardkind|wizard]], who became famous for his eccentric behaviour, such as wearing a [[jellyfish]] as a hat, and sleeping in a room with fifty pet [[Augurey]]s. He is considered to be one of the most unconventional and weirdest wizards in history, and, as such, is often the punchline of [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] jokes.<ref name="pottermore"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|Well, I did say we ''[Ravenclaws]'' produce eccentrics. In fact, we are also the house that gave the wizarding world Uric the Oddball, who used a jellyfish for a hat. He's the punchline of a lot of wizarding jokes.|[[Robert Hilliard]], Ravenclaw [[Prefect]]|Pottermore}}
Uric was born in the Middle Ages, no earlier than [[First millennium A.D.|982]],<ref name="birthdate"/> somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]]. In his youth, Uric attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

===Adulthood===
{{Quote|Uric the Oddball is known to have slept in a room containing no fewer than fifty pet Augureys. During one particularly wet winter, Uric became convinced by the moaning of his Augureys that he had died and was now a ghost. His subsequent attempts to walk through the walls of his house resulted in what his biographer Radolphus Pittiman describes as a "concussion of ten days' duration."|[[Newton Scamander]], {{FB}}|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (real)}}

At some point, Uric became famous for wearing a [[jellyfish]] for a hat. This, among other things, is still what Uric is best remembered for.<ref name="PSg">{{PS|G}}</ref>

Uric was known to have slept in a room with fifty pet [[Augurey]]s. The Augurey's distinctive low and throbbing cry was once believed to foretell death, although the bird actually cries at the approach of [[Water|rain]]. On a particularly rainy winter, the moaning of his [[Augurey]]s convinced Uric that he was [[Death|dead]], and had returned as a [[ghost]]. He constantly attempted to walk through the walls of his house, which resulted in a ten-day long [[concussion]].<ref name="FB">{{FB|R}} - ''An A-Z of Fantastic Beasts''</ref>

At one time, Uric the Oddball attempted to prove that the song of the [[Fwooper]] was actually beneficial to one's health. After listening to it for three months without a break, he presented his findings to the [[Wizards' Council]]. The Council was left unconvinced, as Uric arrived at the meeting wearing nothing but a toupee that, on closer inspection, proved to be a dead [[badger]].<ref name="FB"/>

===Death and post-mortem===
{{Quote|Easily the most boring class was History of Magic, which was the only one taught by a ghost. Professor Binns ''[…]'' droned on and on while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emeric the Evil and Uric the Oddball mixed up.|Uric the Oddball's legacy being covered in History of Magic classes at Hogwarts|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Uric the Oddball.png||150px|thumb|right|Uric's depiction on a Chocolate Frog Card]]
Uric died sometime in the Middle Ages. In honour of his eccentricity, a small biography of him was recorded on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="PSg"/> At some point, [[Radolphus Pittiman]] studied Uric's life, and became his biographer.<ref name="FB"/>

In the [[1989–1990 school year]] at Hogwarts, Uric the Oddball was the subject of a [[sixth year]] [[History of Magic]] lecture, and one of the very few delivered by Binns to evoke any interest from the students; [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] thought he seemed like a laugh and wanted to meet him, [[Andre Egwu]] respected his dodgy but creative fashion sense, [[Ben Copper]] respected his courage to be whatever he wanted to be, and [[Tulip Karasu]], herself often considered eccentric and chaotic, called him an artist ahead of his times.<ref name="HM637">{{HM|6|37|hm}}</ref>

In the [[1991-1992 school year]], students of [[History of Magic]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] would scribble down names and dates, and mix up Uric the Oddball with [[Emeric the Evil]], while [[Cuthbert Binns|Professor Binns]] droned on.<ref name="PS8">{{PS|B|8}}</ref>

On [[1 September]], [[1991]], [[Prefect]] [[Robert Hilliard]] welcomed the [[Ravenclaw]] [[first year]]s to [[Ravenclaw Tower]] with a short speech in which he mentioned eccentric Uric the Oddball as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]], like them, into Ravenclaw.<ref name="pottermore"/>
