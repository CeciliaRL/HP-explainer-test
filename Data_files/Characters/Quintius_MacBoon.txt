'''Quintius MacBoon''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the head of the [[MacBoon clan]]. According to legend, he killed the head of the [[McClivert clan]], [[Dugald McClivert]] in a drunken [[Duelling|duel]]. The [[death]] led to the McClivert clan [[Transfiguration|transfiguring]] the MacBoons into extremely dangerous [[flesh]]-eating [[beast]]s known as [[Quintaped]]s, presumably including Quintius.<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>
