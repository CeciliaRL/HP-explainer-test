{{Quote|Somebody told me that Hagrid's evil twin, Dirgah, is hiding in the forbidden corridor and Dumbledore doesn't know how to get rid of him.|[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] student in [[1991]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}

'''Dirgah Hagrid''' was supposedly [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s evil twin brother. In [[1991]] there was rumour among the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] student body that the [[Third-floor corridor|Forbidden Corridor]] housed Dirgah because [[Albus Dumbledore|Headmaster Dumbledore]] did not know how to get rid of him.<ref>{{PS|G}} - GBA version</ref> This proved false, as the contents of the Forbidden Corridor were a [[Philosopher's Stone Chambers|series of obstacles]] to protect the [[Philosopher's Stone]].

==Behind the scenes==
*"Dirgah" is "Hagrid" spelt backwards. Therefore, "Dirgah Hagrid" spelt backwards is "Dirgah Hagrid" as well. Thus his full name is a palindrome.
