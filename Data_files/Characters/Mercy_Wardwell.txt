'''Mercy Wardwell'''<ref name="Insider">[http://insider.pottermore.com/2014/05/read-ginny-potters-match-reports-from.html "Read Ginny Potter's match reports from the 2014 Quidditch World Cup every day this week"] at [http://insider.pottermore.com Pottermore Insider]</ref> was an American [[Wizardkind|witch]] who played as the [[Chaser]] for the [[American National Quidditch team]], and competed in the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]].

==Biography==
During the [[United States of America|America]]-[[Brazil]] semi-finals taking place on [[4 July]] and [[5 July]], the nerves got to Wardwell and after her fifth fumble with the [[Quaffle]], she began to repeatedly hit her head against her broom handle before being stopped by fellow teammate and [[Seeker]], [[Darius Smackhammer]].

During the play-offs for third place against [[Japan]] on [[9 July]], she and her fellow American Chasers, [[Arsenia Gonzales]] and [[Quentin Kowalski]], scored twelve goals. The Japanese Seeker, [[Noriko Sato]], went into a spectatular dive and grabbed the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] from under Wardwell's heel, allowing Japan to win with a score of 330-120.
