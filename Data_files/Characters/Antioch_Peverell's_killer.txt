This '''[[Wizardkind|wizard]]''' (fl. between [[1214]] and [[1291]]) was present in a pub when [[Antioch Peverell]] boasted of having an [[Elder Wand|unbeatable wand]]. He slit Antioch's throat during the night and stole the [[wand]] from him.<ref name="DH21">{{DH|B|21}}</ref><ref name="TBB">{{TBB|T}}</ref>

==Biography==
In the 13th century, this wizard was at an inn when [[Antioch Peverell]] came in after killing a wizard he had once quarrelled with. Peverell began to drink wine and brag about his his new [[Elder Wand|indestructible wand]] had granted him victory over his enemy, which the unknown wizard overheard.<ref name="DH21"/><ref name="TBB"/>

Envious of the wand's power the wizard waited until Peverell, drunk with wine, went to sleep. Slipping into his room, the wizard stole the wand and slit Peverell's throat to make sure he wasn't followed. The wizard then slipped into the night with his new powerful wand. It's unknown what happened to this wizard afterwards, though he likely suffered the same fate as Antioch and was killed by another for the possession of the [[Elder Wand]].<ref name="DH21"/><ref name="TBB"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*The identity of this wizard is unknown, as is the wizard who presumably killed him.
*In the consoles versions of the video game adaption of ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (video game)|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1]]'', the killer used the [[Killing Curse]] instead of a knife to murder Antioch.
*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, he is omitted. Instead, his victim [[Antioch Peverell]] got grabbed by Death but what happened to the [[Elder Wand]] or who owned it before [[Mykew Gregorovitch|Gregorovitch]] is unknown.
