'''Violetta Beauvais''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[wizardkind|witch]].<ref name="pottermore-1920s">{{WW|1920s-wizarding-america-en}}</ref> She, along with [[Shikoba Wolfe]], [[Thiago Quintana]], and [[Johannes Jonker]], was one of four [[wandmaker]]s who served [[North America]] in the early [[20th century]].<ref name="pottermore-1920s" />

==Biography==
Beauvais was born in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].<ref name="pottermore-1920s" /> All of the [[wand]]s she produced were made from [[swamp mayhaw]] wood.<ref name="pottermore-1920s" /> For many years, she kept the [[wand core|core]] she used in her wands a closely-guarded secret, but it was eventually discovered to be [[rougarou hair]].<ref name="pottermore-1920s" /> Beauvais's wands were often accused of having a natural affinity for [[Dark Arts|Dark magic]].<ref name="pottermore-1920s" /> However, many great American wizards of the [[1920s]] used Beauvais-made wands, including [[President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America|President]] [[Seraphina Picquery]].<ref name="pottermore-1920s" />

==Etymology==
''Violetta'' is a form of the name Violet, after the flower of the genus ''Viola''. They share their name with a shade of purple, a popular colour among wizards

''Beauvais'' is a French surname, from ''beau'' ("beautiful") + ''vais'' ("to go (away)"). Violetta may be named after René Beauvais, a carpenter and master woodcarver from Lower Canada known for his extensive work on churches.

==Behind the scenes==
Since [[Rappaport's Law]] required  a [[Wand permit]], it is unknown how users of these wands would apply for a permit as the [[Wand permit|wand Permit application]] requires the applicant to tell the [[Wand Permit Office]] details of the wand. It might be that she was required to inform the [[Federal Wand Permit Officer]].
