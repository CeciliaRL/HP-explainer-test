==Biography==
Upon procuring a [[wand]] and learning the [[Dark Arts]], this wizard joined the [[Death Eaters]] and became a loyal follower and servant of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. On [[2 May]] [[1998]], he was called upon to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], along with all his fellow Death Eaters. After the protective enchantments around the castle were broken, he came smashing in through a window in [[The Quad]] [[The Quad battlements|battlements]] to attack the defenders within via [[Unsupported flight|flight]]. Before he could harm anybody, he was hit by [[Momentum-reversing spell]] used by [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]], which halted him right in his tracks then sent him flying back out the window, likely [[Death|killing]] him in the subsequent fall.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>
