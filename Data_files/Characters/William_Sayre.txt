'''William Sayre''' (d. [[1608]]) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. He was the husband of [[Rionach Sayre]] and the father of [[Isolt Sayre]]. Isolt was one of the founders of [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. William showed sympathy towards his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours and because of that was murdered by his sister-in-law [[Gormlaith Gaunt]].<ref name="Pottermore" />

==Biography==
William was a descendant of [[Morrigan]], an [[Animagus]] whose animal form was a [[crow]]. By [[1603]], he had married a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], [[Rionach Sayre|Rionach Gaunt]] and was living at [[Ilvermorny Cottage]] in [[Coomloughra]], [[County Kerry]], [[Ireland]]. Their daughter, [[Isolt Sayre|Isolt]], was born that year.<ref name="Pottermore" />

William nicknamed his daughter ‘Morrigan’ for her affinity for all natural things when she was young. He and his wife [[love]]d their daughter very much and were quietly helpful to their [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours, producing [[magic]]al cures for [[human]]s and livestock alike.<ref name="Pottermore" />

However, when Isolt was five, William and Rionach were killed in a fire started by his estranged sister-in-law, [[Gormlaith Gaunt]], who "saved" Isolt with the intention of raising her with a belief in [[pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood superiority]]. Isolt eventually fled Gormlaith and moved to the [[United States of America|New World]], where she befriended a [[Pukwudgie]], who she named William in honour of her father. William had two granddaughters through Isolt's marriage to [[James Steward]], [[Martha Steward II|Martha]] and [[Rionach Steward]], as well as two grandsons by adoption, [[Chadwick Boot|Chadwick]] and [[Webster Boot]].<ref name="Pottermore" />

==Personality and traits==
William, much like his wife, was a very kind-hearted and generous man and father, who [[love]]d his wife and daughter dearly and cared much for the well-being and happiness of others. Along with his life, he held very tolerant attitudes towards his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours, helping them with [[magic]], meaning despite being a pure-blood, he viewed them as equal to [[Wizardkind]], and was not a [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]] like many other pure-bloods.<ref name="Pottermore" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': William was proficient in the art of medical magic, as he was able to find [[magic]]al cures for his Muggle neighbour's illnesses and livestock alike, meaning he would have used [[healing spell]]s, [[potion]]s and other magical remedies.<ref name="Pottermore" />
