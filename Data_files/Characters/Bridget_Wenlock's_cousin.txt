==Biography==
[[Bridget Wenlock]] once thought she had mistakenly sent an envelope (on which she thought she had scribbled the theorem that led to her discovery of the magical properties of the number [[seven]] in [[Invisible Ink]]) to her cousin. After chasing the owl that brought the letter and after casting a [[Revealing Charm]], Wenlock found out that the envelope contained no more than a [[cake]] recipe, and that she had, in fact, scrawled her calculation on a sugar packet that she had left at home.<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}} - see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCPN3KmWEMA&feature=context-shows&list=SL this video]</ref>
