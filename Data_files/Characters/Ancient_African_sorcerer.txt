This '''ancient African sorcerer''' (fl. early [[1600s]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] from somewhere in [[Africa]], who was responsible for teaching [[Eldon Elsrickle]], a thief hailing from [[London]], about the [[Unlocking Charm]]. The Charm was not known in [[Great Britain]], and when Elsrickle returned, he conducted a series of mysterious robberies, earning him the sobriquet "The Spectral Thief of Old London Town".<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}} - see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9LNQV7cGIA&feature=relmfu this video]</ref>
