'''Ugga''' (fl. [[12th century]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who lived in the same village as [[Goodwin Kneen]], and played ''[[Quidditch|Kwidditch]]'' (''Quidditch'') with him in the role that would become known as a ''[[Beater]]''. He was old, and during a match against a team from Ilkley, he failed to intercept a ''[[Bludger|Blooder]]'' (''Bludger'') that hit [[Radulf]] in the head.<ref>{{QTA|R|3}}</ref>
