A very pretty [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] girl worked as a '''shopgirl''' at a paper shop in [[Ottery St Catchpole]].<ref name="HBP16"/>

==Biography==
During the [[Christmas]] holidays of [[1996]], she was visited by [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]]; the latter showed her card tricks that she found extremely impressive, unaware that George was using real [[magic]].<ref name="HBP16"/>

The Weasley twins mentioned her to [[Harry Potter]] and their younger brother [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] when they announced that they were leaving [[the Burrow]] for the village, and refused to assist Harry and Ron in peeling sprouts. This was partly because Ron had thrown a knife at Fred, who taunted him about his romance with [[Lavender Brown]], suggesting that she must have suffered "extensive brain damage" to be dating him.<ref name="HBP16">{{HBP|B|16}}</ref>
