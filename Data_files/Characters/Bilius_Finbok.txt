'''Bilius Finbok''' was an [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] that lived in [[Cornwall]] and worked in the [[British Ministry of Magic]]'s [[Department of Intoxicating Substances]]. He was described by [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] as smelling of sulphur and able to mix terrific [[alcohol|cocktails]].<ref name="FBC5">{{FBC|5}}</ref>

==Biography==
Finbok may have been in [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as there was a Hufflepuff [[House scarf|scarf]] in his cottage and in his secret owlery.<ref name="FBC5"/>

His disappearance from his cottage was investigated by Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner. He was found to have been transported to [[St David's Hospital|St David's]], a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] hospital, after his Muggle neighbour [[Sara Farnham]] discovered him injured and unconscious.<ref name="FBC5"/>

Ultimately, his injuries were linked to the use of illegal materials from [[magic]]al [[beast]]s in the brewing of [[potion]]s, for which he was summoned to appear before the Ministry.<ref name="FBC5"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Finbok was proficient in the [[magic]]al art and [[science]] of potion-making, brewing many experimental mixtures in his spare time as an amateur [[Potioneer]]. These used an eclectic range of different ingredients, some of which were illegally sourced.<ref name="FBC5" />
*'''Expert mixologist:''' Finbok was known for his skill in mixing {{w|cocktail}}s. This was likely an offshoot of potion experiments, and his familiarity with various types of alcohol through his work.
*'''Underworld connections:''' Some of his potion ingredients were illegally sourced, suggesting he was familiar with at least one disreputable merchant to obtain them.
