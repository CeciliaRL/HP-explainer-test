'''Sirius Black II''' ([[1877]] – [[1952]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], the eldest son of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]] and [[Ursula Flint]], and brother of [[Phineas Black|Phineas]], [[Cygnus Black II]], [[Belvina Black|Belvina]] and [[Arcturus Black II|Arcturus]]; husband of [[Hesper Gamp]], father of [[Arcturus Black III]], [[Lycoris Black|Lycoris]], and [[Regulus Black I|Regulus]], and great-grandfather of [[Sirius Black]] and [[Regulus Black|Regulus Arcturus Black]] (and namesake of the former).<ref name="BFT" />

He was depicted on the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]].<ref name="BFT" />

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on a statement by [[Horace Slughorn]], Sirius may have been a member of the [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. That would make him the only Sirius Black who was sorted into Slytherin house; his uncle [[Sirius Black I]] died before going to Hogwarts and [[Sirius Black III]] was sorted into [[Gryffindor]] house. However, he attended Hogwarts c. [[1888]] - [[1895]], when Slughorn was not the Potions teacher. However seeing that Slughorn was born somewhere between 1882 and 1913 and if he was born in the former, Slughorn and Sirius would have been in school together with Sirius being in his third or fourth year. 
*Sirius II had the same name as his [[Sirius Black I|paternal uncle]] who died very young.
*Sirius II named his son Arcturus, the same as [[Arcturus Black II|his brother]] and [[Arcturus Black I|his great uncle]].

==Etymology==
''Sirius'' is the name of the [[Wikipedia:Sirius|Dog Star]] (''Alpha Canis Majoris''), which with an apparent magnitude of -1.46 is the brightest star in the night sky.
