These '''murder victims''' were a group of twelve [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] killed by an explosion deliberately caused by [[Peter Pettigrew]] on [[1 November]], [[1981]].<ref name="POA19">{{POA|B|19}}</ref> This event was one of the most infamous massacres in recent times.<ref name="poa3" />

==History==
===Origins===
Eventually, three of these Muggles became employed as a guard, guitarist, and officer respectively, while the others pursued unknown careers.<ref name="Lego"/>

===Destroyed by Peter Pettigrew===
After betraying the [[Potter family|Potters]], Pettigrew was pursued by [[Sirius Black]], and was eventually cornered by him on a crowded [[London]]<ref name="London"/> street. Pettigrew then loudly accused Black of betraying the Potters, cast an extremely powerful explosive [[curse]] (likely the [[Blasting Curse]]), and escaped, leaving behind a finger he had cut off to fake his [[death]]. This explosion claimed the lives of twelve Muggles, and left a deep crater in the street. Over fifty Muggle witnesses reported what Pettigrew said to [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] officials. Black was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] without trial. Before his capture, Black was found laughing like a maniac, seemingly confirming his guilt.<ref name="poa3" />

The Ministry of Magic had difficulty covering up this event given the extent of the damage and the number of Muggle casualties.<ref name="poa3">{{POA|B|3}}</ref> They [[Memory Charm|erased]] the memories of surviving Muggle witnesses<ref name="poa10"/> and disseminated the story that the explosion had been caused by a leak in a gas main.<ref name="poa3" />

===Legacy===
It was not until [[1994]] that [[Remus Lupin]] realised Black was innocent and convinced [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] to believe the truth.<ref name="POA19"/> Nevertheless, [[Cornelius Fudge]] ignored their stories,<ref name="POA21">{{POA|B|21}}</ref> and the Ministry continued to consider Black guilty until after his murder in the [[Battle of the Department of Mysteries]] on [[18 June]], [[1996]].<ref name="OOTP36">{{OOTP|B|36}}</ref>
