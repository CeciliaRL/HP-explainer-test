This '''boy''' slew the [[giant]] mercenary [[Goliath]] using only a [[catapult]] during the [[Israelite-Philistine war|war]] between the [[Israelites]] and [[Philistines]] in [[Bible|Biblical]] times.<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the book [[Wikipedia:Books_of_Samuel|1 Samuel]] of the {{wplink|Old Testament}}, [[David (king)|King David]] slays the giant Goliath with a slingshot as a child, but the [[Chocolate Frog Card]] for Goliath only refers to the giant's slayer as a "young boy" and does not explicitly name David. This may have to do with the fact that in 2 Samuel, [[Wikipedia:Elhanan, son of Jair|Elhanan, son of Jair]] is credited for killing Goliath, rather than David. Alternatively, the producers of the game in which the card appears may have wished to avoid naming David to avoid offending religious sensibilities.
*Giants in the ''Harry Potter'' universe are said to be between twenty and twenty five feet tall. According to a common interpretation of the Bible, Goliath was about 9 feet 9 inches, making him extremely short by giant standards (but still taller than the {{w|Robert Wadlow|tallest recorded human}}), suggesting that he may have been a [[Half-giant]]. Other interpretations place his height at about 6 feet 7 inches, a more realistic height for a human who was still extremely tall by the standards of the time, making the term "Giant" descriptive.
*Though David's weapon is sometimes depicted as a [[catapult]], historically it was more likely to have been a {{w|Sling (weapon)|sling}} weapon.
