This '''man''' was the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] stepfather of [[Dean Thomas]].

==Biography==
He married [[Dean Thomas' mother|Dean's mother]] some time after she was abandoned by her [[Dean Thomas's father|first husband]]. They had several [[Dean Thomas's half-siblings|children]] together and lived happily in [[London]].<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=2 Dean Thomas's background] at {{JKRS}}</ref>

After [[Cedric Diggory]] was murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in [[1995]], Dean consciously avoided telling his parents about the event, presumably because he did not want them to pull him out of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], although it also seemed likely the same murderer would be coming after their son as well, hence he did not wish to fill his parents with unneeded dread.<ref name="OOTP11">{{OOTP|B|11}}</ref>

When Dean was forced to go into hiding during the [[Second Wizarding War]], Mr Thomas and his wife did not know where he had gone, and feared the worst, so ''[[Potterwatch]]'' broadcasted a request urging anyone who was with Dean to order him to please contact his family.<ref name="DH22">{{DH|B|22}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It may have been possible that Dean Thomas' story could have been partially inspired by the song "Colour Him Father" by an American group The Winstons, which tells of a young man respecting his stepfather who cares for him and several siblings. The stepfather married a war widow, as the narrator says his true father "was killed in the war", akin to Dean Thomas' father being killed by Voldemort.
