The '''Potters' [[cat]]''' was a pet of the [[Potter family]]. This cat was mentioned in [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]]' [[Lily J. Potter's letter to Sirius Black|letter]] to [[Sirius Black]] that [[Harry Potter|Harry]] had nearly killed it while flying on Sirius' birthday present to Harry, a toy broomstick.<ref name="DH10">{{DH|B|10}}</ref> It is currently unknown if it died when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] attacked the Potters, or escaped unharmed.

==Behind the scenes==
*There is a popular theory that the Potters' cat is none other than [[Crookshanks]], Hermione's pet cat, half-Kneazle. This is based on the fact that Crookshanks helped Sirius Black in his search for Peter Pettigrew, possibly because both Sirius and Peter frequented the Potter house and he recognised them perfectly, both in their human and Animagus forms, and thanks to his intelligence, it is likely that he learned from Sirius that Peter was the traitor, and that thanks to Sirius his owners were killed, or that he learned of Peter's treachery on his own, recognising him in his Animagus form as Scabbers, Ron's pet rat, and seeing that he was still alive, thus proving Sirius's innocence. Other possible evidence for this is the cat's physical appearance, according to the Potter family portrait released on Pottermore, which is very similar to that of Crookshanks. However, none of this has been confirmed by Rowling, and remains mere speculation.
