This [[Portrait]] of a '''mother and baby''' hung beside the portrait of the [[Fat Lady]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. The baby cried when the school found out what [[Sirius Black]] did to the portrait of the Fat Lady when he [[Sirius Black's break-in of Hogwarts Castle (1993)|broke into the castle]]. Both mother and child were also distressed by the Fat Lady's horrible singing at the beginning of the school year.<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}} - Chapter 13 (''Flight of the Fat Lady'')</ref>
