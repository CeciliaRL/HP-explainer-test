'''Syna Hyslop''' was a [[wizardkind|witch]] who co-invented the [[Doubling Charm]] with her her twin sister [[Helixa Hyslop|Helixa]].<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}}</ref>

==Biography==
Noted for their eccentricity, the twins preferred to keep to themselves, living alone together in a mansion their whole lives. After they died, their relatives found that their home contained duplicates of every item inside, down to the set of hand-written instructions for the Doubling Charm that each twin left on one of the matching tables in the kitchen.<ref name="WBoS"/>
