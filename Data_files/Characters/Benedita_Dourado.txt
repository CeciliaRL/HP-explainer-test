==Biography==
She went on an exchange visit to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] sometime during [[Armando Dippet|Professor Armando Dippet]]'s tenure as Head of Hogwarts. When Dippet complained of [[Peeves]], the resident [[poltergeist]], Professor Dourado laughed heartily and offered to send him some [[Caipora]] for the [[Forbidden Forest]] "to show [him] what trouble really is." Professor Dippet did not take her up on this offer.<ref name="PM"/>

==Etymology==
*''[[Wikipedia:Benedita|Benedita]]'' is the feminine form of ''Benedito'', which is the Portuguese form of [[Benedict]]. "Benedita" comes from the [[Latin]] "''bene''" (well) and "''dicere''" (to speak), and it means "(she who is) blessed"; the same etymon also originated the English word "[[Wikipedia:Benediction|benediction]]".
*"''Dourado''" means "golden" in Portuguese, and it is not a fairly common surname in either Brazil or Portugal.
