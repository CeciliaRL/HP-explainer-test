==Etymology==
*From the Germanic elements ''rand'' meaning "rim (of a shield)" and ''wulf'' meaning "wolf". The Normans brought this name to England, where there existed already an Old Norse cognate ''Randúlfr'', which had been introduced by Scandinavian settlers. Randolf became rare after the Middle Ages, though it was revived in the 18th century (usually in the spelling ''Randolph'').
*A burrow is a hole or tunnel dug in the ground by a small animal, such as a rabbit or mole, for habitation or refuge.
