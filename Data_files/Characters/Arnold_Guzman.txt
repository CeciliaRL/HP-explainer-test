Grindelwald wants to see that peace destroyed and for certain members of our community his message is very seductive. Many purebloods believe it is their birthright to rule not only our world but the non-magic world as well.|Arnold Guzman's concerns about [[Gellert Grindelwald]]|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}
