This '''man''' was a member of the [[Pocomtuc]] people during the [[17th century]]. He had at least [[Martha Steward II's friend|one sibling]], who was friends with [[Martha Steward II|Martha Steward]], the [[Squib]] daughter of [[Isolt Sayre]] and [[James Steward]]. He was known to be non-[[magic]]al, but it is unknown whether he was a [[Muggle|No-Maj]] with a [[Muggle-born|No-Maj-born]] sibling, or a [[Squib]] born to [[wizardkind|wizard]] parents. He eventually married Martha, and she subsequently integrated into No-Maj society.<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|ilvermorny}}</ref>

== Behind the scenes ==

* If this man was a [[squib]], he and [[Martha Steward II|his wife]] would be the only known squib couple.
* It is not known whether this man and his wife ever had children, but if they did there is a possibility that [[Salazar Slytherin]] still has descendants besides [[Delphini]]. However they would most likely be [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]], or [[Muggle-born|No-Maj born]], so Salazar Slytherin ironically would have descendants who were one of the two categories of people he hated the most.
