The '''Old Posh Baron''' was a [[portrait]] at [[Hogwarts Castle]], portraying a kind, polite old nobleman.<ref name="PSG"/><ref name="COSG"/>

==History==
===[[1991–1992 school year]]===
In the [[1991–1992 school year]], it hung in a [[Portrait Room]] next to the [[Great Hall]], guarding a secret chamber where a [[Nimbus 2000]] was kept. The [[password]] to this room, "''Fizzy Pop''", was traded to [[Harry Potter]] for fifty earwax flavour [[Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans]] by [[Fred and George Weasley]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}} - PS1 version</ref>

===[[1992–1993 school year]]===
In the [[1992–1993 school year]], the Portrait Room, where the Baron's portrait hung became an out-of-bounds area, so the portrait was moved to a secret room behind a bookcase, guarding a small chamber with a lever.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}} - PS1 version</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This individual died sometime prior to [[1991]], as the portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] depict deceased individuals.<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2004/0804-ebf.htm JKR at Edinburgh Book Festival 2004]</ref>
*All of the special portraits in the [[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)|PS1 version]] of {{PS}} return in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|next game]] as guards to the Founders' Duels Arenas. As this portrait does not guard any arena in ''Chamber of Secrets'', it is likely this individual is a [[Gryffindor]].
