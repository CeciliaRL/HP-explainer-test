{{Quote|Zabini, who was interrogated after [[Cormac McLaggen|McLaggen]], turned out to have a famously beautiful witch for a mother (from what [[Harry Potter|Harry]] could make out, she had been married seven times, each of her husbands dying mysteriously and leaving her mounds of gold).|Description|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}
'''Mrs Zabini''' (fl. [[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the mother of [[Blaise Zabini]]. She was famously beautiful, and married [[Blaise Zabini's mother's seven husbands|seven wizards]] who each died in mysterious circumstances, leaving her with a large amount of [[gold]] from each. Her fame was known to [[Horace Slughorn]], who invited her son to his compartment on the [[Hogwarts Express]] for that reason as a member of the [[Slug Club]].<ref name="HBP7">{{HBP|B|7}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is unknown if Zabini was her maiden name or one of her married names.
*It is speculated that she [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariticide killed each of her husbands], to gain their inheritance, given the mysterious nature of their deaths.
