==Etymology==
*To "''swoop''" is to "''move rapidly downward through the air''", perhaps an indication towards {{Wplink|entomology}}.<ref name="etymology2">See [http://www.google.ca/#hl=en&gs_rn=8&gs_ri=psy-ab&cp=16&gs_id=1q&xhr=t&q=What+does+swoop+mean&es_nrs=true&pf=p&output=search&sclient=psy-ab&oq=What+does+swoop+&gs_l=&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&bvm=bv.44770516,d.b2I&fp=61d5413764df7ae5&biw=1366&bih=643 this definition here]</ref>
*A "''stike''" is a stanza, and therefore the plural form of stike, "''stikes''", refers to multiple stanzas.<ref name="etymology1">See [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/stike this definition here]</ref>
