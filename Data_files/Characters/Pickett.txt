'''Pickett''' was a male [[Bowtruckle]] that was kept by [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] as a pet. Although he had at least six Bowtruckles<ref name="EW2016-08-12">[http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707928_bowtruckle "'Fantastic Beasts': Meet the Creatures"] at [http://www.ew.com/ Entertainment Weekly]</ref> (Pickett, [[Titus]], [[Finn]], [[Poppy]], [[Marlow]], and [[Tom (Bowtruckle)|Tom]]),<ref name="bowtruckles">[https://twitter.com/FantasticBeasts/status/794333143096442880 Twitter - Fantastic Beasts]</ref> Newt was especially fond of Pickett, and even carried him around in his top pocket,<ref>"[http://wizardsandwhatnot.com/2016/08/01/fantastic-beasts-cast-on-british-versus-american-wizards/ Fantastic Beasts Cast on British Versus American Wizards]" from Wizards and Whatnot</ref> first because Pickett had a cold and needed body warmth, and also because Pickett had attachment issues.<ref name="EW2016-08-12"/>

==Biography==
In [[1926]], Pickett accompanied Newt on his journey to [[New York]], sitting inside his top pocket. He was present when the [[Niffler]] escaped at the [[Steen National Bank]] and when Newt was taken to the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]] by [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]].

Pickett was still hidden in Newt's pocket when [[Gellert Grindelwald]], in the guise of [[Percival Graves]], wrongfully sentenced them to death.<ref>{{FB|S|65}}</ref> As bowtruckles are able to [[Lock picking|pick locks]], Pickett was able to release Newt from his shackles and help Newt and Tina escape from the [[Death Cell]].<ref name="FB69">{{FB|S|69}}</ref>

Later, when Newt met the goblin gangster [[Gnarlak]], Newt agreed to give Pickett to him as part of a deal to obtain information about the last missing beasts. Gnarlak betrayed them and turned them in to [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]]. In the resulting fray, Jacob punched Gnarlak out so Newt was able to rescue Pickett and escape.<ref>{{FB|S|82}}</ref> Pickett was not pleased with Newt for giving him away and expressed it by sulking and blowing raspberries.<ref name="FB92">{{FB|S|92}}</ref>

In [[1927]] Pickett was present while Newt was waiting for an interrogation at the [[British Ministry of Magic|British]] [[British Ministry of Magic Headquarters|Ministry of Magic]] regarding his international travel ban.<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>

Pickett also accompanied Newt on his journey to [[Paris]]. When Newt and [[Jacob Kowalski]] found Tina imprisoned by [[Yusuf Kama]] in his hideout in the Paris' sewers, they were also imprisoned by him. When Yusuf fainted, due to a [[water dragon]] [[Water dragon parasite|parasite]] in his eye, Pickett opened the lock in the gate and helped get them out of the room.<ref name="COGS"/>

Pickett then snuck out of Newt's pocket and caused [[Leta Lestrange|Leta]] to find Newt and Tina at the [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room]].

==Skills==
