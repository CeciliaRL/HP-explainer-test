==Biography==
Despite being [[Sorting Hat|Sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]], he did not excel in his studies, and has said that he would like to have the same job as [[Rubeus Hagrid]]. However, he thought [[Horace Slughorn]] was a good teacher, and learned to prepare a [[potion]] from him.<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*"Scott" is from an English and Scottish surname which meant "a Scotsman". The original meaning of the word Scot is debated, but it may mean "[[tattoo]]", so given because Scotsmen often had tattoos.
*"Ancrum" is a Scottish name and is a habitational name from a place in Roxburghshire (Borders) called Ancrum, earlier Alncromb ‘bend in the river Ale’, from a word related to Welsh crwm ‘bent’, ‘curved’.
