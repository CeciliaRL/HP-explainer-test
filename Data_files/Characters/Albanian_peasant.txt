This '''peasant''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] who was born in [[Albania]]. When [[Tom Riddle|Tom Marvolo Riddle]] had found [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]'s [[Rowena Ravenclaw's Diadem|diadem]], he killed the peasant and used the [[death]] to turn the priceless relic into a [[Horcrux]].<ref name="livechat">[https://archive.org/stream/J.k.RowlingChatTranscript/ChatJkRowling_djvu.txt Bloomsbury Live Chat transcript]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Albus Dumbledore]] speculated that Voldemort was reserving the creation of his Horcruxes via significant murders.<ref name="HBP23">{{HBP|B|23}}</ref> This means that this individual played an important role in Voldemort's life, or that Dumbledore's speculation was incorrect (as he admitted he was not perfect, proven with his incorrect belief that Voldemort used [[Frank Bryce]]'s murder to create his [[Nagini|final Horcrux]] when it was in fact [[Bertha Jorkins]]).
