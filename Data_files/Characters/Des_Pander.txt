'''Des Pander''', also known by the nickname '''Dutch''', was an American [[wizardkind|wizarding]] criminal who operated in the [[1920s]].

In or around [[1926]], the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]] issued a wanted poster for Dutch, which stated that he was wanted for grand larceny and [[Muggle|No-Maj]] murder. It described him as "most menacing, "extremely dangerous," and a "malicious killer." A reward of 5000 [[Dragot]]s was offered for information leading to his capture.<ref>{{FB|F}} {{See image|File:DesPander.jpg}}</ref>
