'''Irving Cram''' was a [[Wizardkind|student]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] between [[1987]] and [[1989]]. By the [[1993-1994 school year]], he had been made a [[Prefect]], and was tasked with patrolling areas of the school off limits to students.

He might be related to [[Irving Cram (II)]], another Hogwarts student who was sorted in [[Slytherin]].

==Etymology==
''Irving ''is a Jewish name which means "green water".

To cram is to try to make more things fit in an enclosure than there are meant to be. This is (figuratively) what Prefects try to do all the time.
