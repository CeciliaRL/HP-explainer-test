This '''Ravenclaw lady''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who had [[portrait]]s of herself hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="PS" /><ref name="CS" />

==Biography==
===[[1991–1992 school year]]===
In [[Harry Potter]]'s first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], she was guarding a secret room in the [[Dungeons]], concealing a Quidditch Armour. The password required to gain entrance was "''Wanglewort''".<ref name="PS">{{PS|G}} - PS1 version</ref>

===[[1992–1993 school year]]===
A year later, her portrait had been moved, and now guarded the way to the Ravenclaw Duelling Arena.<ref name="CS">{{COS|G}} - PS1 version</ref>

==Personality and traits==
This witch was proud of her [[Ravenclaw|House]] and considered others who dare duel the Ravenclaw Duelling Champion to be "foolish".<ref name="CS" /> However, in [[1991]] she became very nervous as she sensed there was [[Quirinus Quirrell|someone]] in the castle doing something [[Dark Arts|evil]], showing she was rather observant and intuitive.<ref name="PS" />

==Behind the scenes==
*This witch may have passed away sometime prior to [[1991]], as many portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] depict deceased individuals.
