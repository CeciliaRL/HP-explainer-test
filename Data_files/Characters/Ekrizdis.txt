'''Ekrizdis''' was a [[15th century|15th-century]] [[Dark Wizard]] who was the original inhabitant of the fortress of [[Azkaban]].<ref name="WW"/>

==Biography==
Alone on Azkaban's island, which was at the time uncharted by both [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and [[wizardkind]], Ekrizdis practised the worst kinds of [[Dark Arts|Dark Magic]]. He would often lure passing Muggle sailors to his fortress only to torture and murder them. He was believed to have [[insanity|lost his sanity]] during his years of solitude. After Ekrizdis's death, the [[Concealment Charm]]s he placed on the fortress and island faded, and the [[British Ministry of Magic]], suddenly aware of the island's existence, investigated. Other than the fact that the building was infested with [[Dementor]]s, investigators refused to discuss what other evidence of Ekrizdis's activities they found within Azkaban.<ref name="WW">{{WW|azkaban}}</ref>
