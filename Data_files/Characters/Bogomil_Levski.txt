'''Bogomil Levski''' was a Bulgarian wizard and a [[Chaser]] for the [[2014]] [[Bulgarian National Quidditch team]]. His father [[Alexei Levski]] played in the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] final.

==Biography==
During the first round match of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]], against [[New Zealand National Quidditch team|New Zealand]], Levski was involved in a mid-air collision with opposing Chaser [[Dennis Moon]]. The crash seemed accidental to many spectators, but Moon was sent off. The New Zealand manager [[Charlie Baverstock]] proclaimed himself 'madder then a bloke who's been locked in a box of Fwoopers', after the sending off. Bulgaria won the game 410 - 170.<ref name="PM">{{PM}} - [[BULGARIA VERSUS NEW ZEALAND]] (Archived)</ref>

==Etymology==
*'''''Богомил''''' ''[Bogo'mil]'' is a name formed from Old Bulgarian ''Богу мил ['Bogu mil]'' ("dear to God"), from ''Бог [Bog]'' ("God") and ''мил [mil]'' ("dear"). Father Bogomil was a priest who started the Eastern Orthodox sect known as Bogomilism in the 10th century.
