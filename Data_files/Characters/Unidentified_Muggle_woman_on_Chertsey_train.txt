This [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] '''woman''' was travelling to [[Chertsey]] on a train, but fell asleep (something she apparently does often), and woke up having arrived at [[King's Cross Station]] in [[London]] on [[1 September]], [[1992]]. Her arrival to the incorrect destination was made more irksome when, while waiting near [[Platform 10|Platform Ten]], she stepped in some old [[chewing gum]].<ref>{{COS|G}} - GBC version</ref>
