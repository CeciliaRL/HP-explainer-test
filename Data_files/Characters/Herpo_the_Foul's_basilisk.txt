'''Herpo the Foul's basilisk''' was the first recorded [[basilisk]] in history. It was bred by [[Herpo the Foul]], an Ancient [[Greece|Greek]] [[Dark Wizard]], who discovered after much experimentation that a [[Chicken (animal)|chicken]] [[egg]] hatched beneath a [[toad]] would produce this gigantic [[Snake|serpent]]. Herpo was able to control the basilisk as he was able to speak [[Parseltongue]]. It is said that this particular basilisk lived to be almost 900 years old.<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Ironically, Herpo the Foul was also responsible for creating the first [[Horcrux]] which are known to be vulnerable to [[Basilisk venom]]. It is unknown if there is any further connection.
