{{Quote|Then came the fateful day when Blagdon Blay, a wizard who had been burgled 19 times in two weeks, succeeded in inventing an Anti-Alohomora Charm. In a single night, the wizarding doors of London were sealed shut, and task-forces were dispatched to protect Muggle houses, too.|[[Miranda Goshawk]], ''[[Book of Spells]]''.|Wonderbook: Book of Spells}}
'''Blagdon Blay''' (fl. early [[1600s]]) was an [[England|English]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] and a [[London]]er in the early [[17th century]] who was responsible for the creation of the [[Anti-Alohomora Charm]] â€” effectively stopping a series of burglaries by wizards using the then-innovative [[Unlocking Charm]].<ref name="WBoS"/>

==Biography==
When thief [[Eldon Elsrickle]] introduced the [[Unlocking Charm|Unlocking Spell]] (which he had learnt from an [[ancient African sorcerer]]) to London, there was an unprecedented series of recurring burglaries and break-ins by unscrupulous [[wizardkind|wizards]], upon the homes of [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and [[wizardkind|fellow wizards]] alike.<ref name="WBoS"/>

Blagdon Blay had his house broken into nineteen times in the course of just two weeks. He managed to [[spell creation|develop]] an [[Anti-Alohomora Charm]] to secure his house, and soon all the London wizards sealed their houses shut at night, and special wizard task-forces protected those of Muggles.<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}} - see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9LNQV7cGIA&feature=relmfu this video]</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Blay was highly accomplished with charm-work, having successfully invented the [[Anti-Alohomora Charm]], which he ingeniously used to prevent locks being broken with the [[Unlocking Charm]] and preventing theft, to great success.
*'''[[Spell creation]]''': Blay succeeded in the highly difficult [[magic]]al art of inventing new [[spell]]s, having invented the immensely useful [[Anti-Alohomora Charm]], an excellent magical achievement given the success of the charm.
