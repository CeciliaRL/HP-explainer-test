'''Kneil''' was a [[Kneazle]] owned by [[Murphy McNully]]. A book which Murphy carried with him had pictures of Kneil in it, and Murphy stated that the probability of a specific page being a picture of Kneil was 19.2%. Murphy also compared Kneil to a female Kneazle brought to the [[Quidditch Changing Rooms]] by [[Orion Amari]], stating that the other Kneazle was not as clever as Kneil.<ref name="HM2TQC">{{HM|2|The Quidditch Cup}}</ref>
