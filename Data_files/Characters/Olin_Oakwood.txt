'''Olin Oakwood''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who founded the [[Hogwarts Hippogriff Club|Hippogriff Club]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the [[1800s]].<ref name="HM5T"/>

==Biography==
Olin was in a study group with [[Margaretta Ironbark]] and [[Skylar Flame]]. He was best friends with Ironbark. He was reluctant to compete in the Trials, but was pressured into it by Ironbark and Flame. After he defeated them and won the tournament, their study group fell apart and each of them formed their own clubs, each one dedicated to the areas of study that suited them best.<ref name="HM5T"/>

At some point, he wrote [[Olin Oakwood's journal|a journal]] that detailed the ground rules for his competition with [[Margaretta Ironbark]] and [[Skylar Flame]]. Because of Olin, Ironbark and Flame becoming grudging enemies due to their competition, the [[professor]]s decided to put his journal at the bottom of the lagoon in the [[Hippogriff Clubhouse]], hoping that the clubs' animosity would fade over time.<ref name="HM5T">{{HM|5|THE TOURNAMENT OF CLUBS}}</ref>
