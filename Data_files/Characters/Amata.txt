{{Quote|...had been deserted by a man whom she loved dearly, and she thought her heart would never mend|Amata's description|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}
'''Amata''' is one of the three female protagonists in the story of ''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]'' by the [[Beedle the Bard]].

She suffered from a broken heart due to her being deserted by a man whom she had loved dearly. Hence, she journeyed with two [[Wizardkind|witches]] and a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Sir Luckless|knight]] who had problems like herself to [[the Fountain of Fair Fortune]]. When they reached the fountain, she realised that she no longer needed the fountain and let [[Sir Luckless]] to bath in it instead and, after he did, he proposed to her and she accepted.

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|The stream had washed away all her regret for her lover...|Amata's deserted lover|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}Amata came to the Fountain because she had been jilted by the man she [[love]]d. She hoped that the fountain would heal her broken heart, grief, and longing.<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|F}}</ref>

===Quest for the Fountain===
{{Quote|And Amata became caught upon the armour of a dismal-looking knight who was seated on a bone-thin horse.|Amata|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}
She met up with two [[Wizardkind|witches]] who had problems like herself.<ref name="TBB" /> One of the [[Wizardkind|witches]] was named [[Asha]], who was sick of "a malady no [[Healer]] could cure" and hoped than the Fountain can restore her health. The other was named [[Altheda]], who had been robbed and humiliated by a sorcerer. She hoped that the Fountain would relieve her feelings of helplessness and her poverty.<ref name="TBB" />

[[File:Luckless leading witches.jpg|206x206px|thumb|left|Amata, [[Sir Luckless]], [[Altheda]] and [[Asha]] trying to reach for the Fountain]]
They soon decided that three heads are better than one and pooled their efforts to reach the Fountain together. At first light, a crack in the wall appeared and creepers from the garden reached through and wrapped themselves around [[Asha]], the first [[Wizardkind|witch]], who grabbed onto [[Altheda]], who then took hold of Amata.<ref name="TBB" /> But Amata got tangled in the armour of a knight, and as the vines pulled [[Asha]] in, all three [[Wizardkind|witches]] along with the knight were pulled through the wall and into the garden. Since only one person is permitted to bathe in the Fountain, the first two witches were upset that Amata had inadvertently invited another competitor.<ref name="TBB" /> Because he had no [[magic]]al power, he recognised the women as [[Wizardkind|witches]], and was well-suited to his name, "[[Sir Luckless]]," the knight announced his intention to abandon the quest.<ref name="TBB" />

Amata promptly chided him for giving up then asked him to join their group. They had to get past three challenges,<ref name="TBB" /> the third of which is completed by Amata. The third task asked challengers to pay "the treasure of [their] past."<ref name="TBB" /> Attempts to float or leap across failed. Finally, Amata thought to use her [[wand]] to withdraw the [[Memory|memories]] of the lover who had abandoned her and drop the memories into the water. Stepping stones appeared in the water, and the four were able to cross to the Fountain, where they then had to decide who would bathe in the Fountain.<ref name="TBB" />

===Finding True Love===
{{Quote|Good sir, you must bathe, as a reward for all your chivalry.|Amata to [[Sir Luckless]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}[[File:Treasure-of-past.jpg|244x244px|thumb|The challenge that Amata succeeds in]]

[[Asha]] collapsed from exhaustion and is near death.<ref name="TBB" /> She is in such pain that she cannot make it to the Fountain, and she begs her three friends not to move her. [[Altheda]] quickly mixes a powerful [[potion]] in an attempt to revive her, and the concoction actually cures her malady, so she no longer needs the Fountain's waters. The same went for [[Altheda]], because she could cure this disease and use it as a means to earn money.<ref name="TBB" /> Amata realised that her former lover was a bad person, and that she was actually better off without him. Realising she no longer needed the Fountain's blessing, she told [[Sir Luckless]] to bathe in it instead, and, after he did, he proposed to her, and she accepted.<ref name="TBB" />

==Physical appearance==
{{Quote|...at the feet of Amata, who was the kindest and most beautiful woman he had ever beheld.|[[Sir Luckless]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}Amata is a beautiful woman with wavy blonde hair and very white skin. Her beauty might have been the reason for her being able to attract men, such as her unknown lover and [[Sir Luckless]]. At the end of the story, [[Sir Luckless]] thought Amata was the most beautiful woman he had ever beheld.<ref name="TBB" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|She hoped that the Fountain would relieve her of her grief and longing.|Amata's grief and longing|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}In contrast to [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] heroines who wait to be rescued, Amata is a brave, intelligent, and true-hearted witch who takes her fate in her own hands.<ref name="TBB" />

At the beginning of the story, she was already portrayed as an open and compassionate woman who could empathise with the misfortunes of others, as seen by how she, Asha, and Altheda became good friends through sharing their respective tales of woe, and how they even came to the agreement of uniting and trying to reach the Fountain if they had the chance to. Her initial flaw was that, before the end of the story, she suffered from the grief and longing of a broken heart due to her lover's desertion.

Unlike Altheda and Asha, Amata could be generous to a fault, as demonstrated by how she convinced Sir Luckless to not give up and help them reach their goal, despite the obvious fact that an addition to the group meant increased difficulty of deciding exactly who should bathe in the Fountain if they ever reached it. Her method of conviction, however, was in the form of a good scolding of Sir Luckless' pessimism and apparent cowardice, which seems to testify that Amata was not one to give up easily, and hated seeing others do so without even attempting to try their very best. Later on, she proved her intelligence by solving the riddle of the third trial of the [[Enchanted garden|Enchanted Garden]].

When the four companions finally reached the Fountain, one could also see that Amata was a true and selfless friend, given how she was perfectly willing to forgo her chance to bathe in the Fountain through giving that very chance to Asha, who had collapsed from exhaustion and was on the brink of death.

At the very end of the story, Amata realised that she did not need to bathe in the Fountain after all, for she had grown wise enough to see that her former lover had been cruel and faithless, and it was actually a joy to her to be rid of him. She also realised that she had found a man worthy of her: Sir Luckless, whose proposal of marriage she accepted.<ref name="TBB" />

==Relationships==
===Her Lover===
{{Quote|...had been cruel and faithless, and that it was happiness enough to get rid of him...|Amata's lover|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}Her lover deserted her, causing her grief and longing as she had [[love]]d him dear; she thought her heart would never mend. So she went on a journey to [[the Fountain of Fair Fortune]] so he would [[love]] her again.<ref name="TBB" /> But when she reached the fountain, she had realised that he had been cruel and faithless and she was happy to be rid of him.<ref name="TBB" />

===Asha and Altheda===
{{Quote|Pitying each other, the three woman agree that, should the chance befall them, they would unite and try to reach the Fountain Together|Amata, [[Asha]] and [[Altheda]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}Amata met up with two witches who had problems like herself. So they decided that together would be better and stronger than apart, and they pool their efforts to reach the Fountain together.<ref name="TBB" /> They when they are pulled by the creepers, [[Sir Luckless]] ends up coming with them.<ref name="TBB" />

On their journey to the Fountain, the motley band faces three challenges. First, they face a "monstrous white worm, bloated and blind" who demands "proof of your pain." After several fruitless attempts to attack it with [[magic]] and other means, [[Asha]]'s tears of frustration finally satisfy the worm, and the four are allowed to pass. Next, they face a steep slope and are asked to pay the "fruit of their labours".<ref name="TBB" /> They try and try to make it up the hill but spend hours climbing to no avail. Finally, the hard-won effort of [[Altheda]] as she cheers her friends on (specifically the sweat from her brow) gets them past the challenge.<ref name="TBB" />

At last, they faced a stream in their path and were asked to pay "the treasure of your past."<ref name="TBB" /> Their attempts to float or leap across failed, until Amata thought to use her wand to withdraw the memories of the [[love]]r who abandoned her, and drop them into the water. Stepping stones appeared in the water, and the four were able to cross to the Fountain, where they must decide who gets to bathe.<ref name="TBB" />

[[Asha]] collapsed from exhaustion and was near death.<ref name="TBB" /> She was in such pain that she cannot make it to the Fountain, and she begged her three friends not to move her. [[Altheda]] quickly mixed a powerful [[potion]] in an attempt to revive her, and the concoction actually cures her malady, so she no longer needed the Fountain's waters.<ref name="TBB" /> Because [[Altheda]] now knew how to cure the disease, she decided that she wouldn't need it either. Amata told [[Sir Luckless]] to bathe in the fountain and they set off "arm-in-arm." We then learn that the four friends live long, never realising that the Fountain's waters "carried no enchantment at all."<ref name="TBB" />

===Sir Luckless===
{{Quote|Flushed with success, he begged for her hand and heart...|[[Sir Luckless]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}[[File:Fountain of Fair Fortune.jpg|225x225px|thumb|left|[[Sir Luckless]], Amata, [[Asha]] and [[Altheda]]]]Amata gets tangled in the armour of a knight, and as the vines pull [[Asha]] in, all three [[Wizardkind|witches]] along with the knight get pulled through the wall and into the garden.

Since only one of them will be permitted to bathe in the Fountain, the first two [[Wizardkind|witches]] are upset that Amata inadvertently invited another competitor. Because the knight possessed of no [[magic]]al power, he recognises the women as [[Wizardkind|witches]], and is well-suited to his name, "[[Sir Luckless]]," the knight announces his intention to abandon the quest. Amata promptly chides him for giving up and asks him to join their group.<ref name="TBB" />

The task that [[Sir Luckless]] succeeded in on is the second. The challenge was that they were asked to pay the "fruit of their labours". [[Sir Luckless]] dropped a single coin on the grassy hill and they were able to proceed forwards.<ref name="TBB" />

When they reach the fountain, Amata lets him bathe in the waters. The knight, amazed at his luck, bathes in the Fountain and flings himself "in his rusted armour" at the feet of Amata and begs for her "hand and her heart." Each [[Wizardkind|witch]] achieves their dreams for a cure, a hapless knight wins knowledge of his bravery, and Amata, the one witch who had faith in him, realises that she has found a "man worthy of her."<ref name="TBB" />

==Etymology==
Amata is an Italian word meaning beloved.<ref>[http://www.babynames.com.au/Search/search-main-results.asp] Baby Names.com</ref>

Queen Amata is a minor character in the Aeneid, an epic by Roman poet Virgil, written between 29 and 19 BC. She is the wife of Latinus, a King in Italy. She is somewhat a tragic figure; she commits suicide after the poem's antagonist, Turnus, is defeated in battle. This could be compared to the grief suffered by Amata in Beedle the Bard's tale.<ref>[http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amata Wikipedia entry on Amata]</ref>
