This '''Hufflepuff lady''' had portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]].

==Biography==
===[[1991–1992 school year]]===
In [[Harry Potter]]'s first year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], she was guarding a secret room in the Castle's Grounds, concealing a [[Chocolate Frog Card]]. The password required to gain entrance was "''Catweazle''".<ref name="PS">{{PS|G}} - PS1 version</ref>

===[[1992–1993 school year]]===
A year later, her portrait had been moved, and now guarded the way to the Hufflepuff Duelling Turrets.<ref name="CS">{{COS|G}} - PS1 version</ref> Another portrait was also created which guarded a lever room inside a secret area behind a bookcase in the [[Knights' Room]]. She was kept with company by the [[Unidentified Slytherin knight|Slytherin knight]].

==Behind the scenes==
*This witch may have passed away sometime prior to [[1991]] as many portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] depict deceased individuals.
*[[Wikipedia:Catweazle|''Catweazle'']] was a British children's television series in the [[1970s]] that featured an eccentric, time-travelling wizard.
*In the Danish version of ''Philosopher's Stone'' there is a mistake when Harry uses the password: [[Fred Weasley|Fred]] and [[George Weasley]] tell Harry to say "''Katvæsel''" (''Catweasle''), but Harry says ''"Katvæsen"'' (''Catcreature'') to the portrait. This appears to be a typo.
