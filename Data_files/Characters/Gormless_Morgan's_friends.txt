{{Quote|Morg's friends told him: 'Think out a plan, first!' But of all things, he hated to think worst. 'Don't make such a fuss. I'll just take a truss. And trap her before I can be cursed!'|[[Miranda Goshawk]], [[The Rhyme of Gormless Morgan]]}}

They are most likely based on real people as most stories made by [[Miranda Goshawk]] were about real people who had their name changed to protect their identity. Morgan had been given a job by [[Gormless Morgan's boss|his boss]] to kill a fearsome [[Gorgon]], a [[creature]] that could turn people into stone. They gave Morg the advice to have a plan first. Sadly, their friend was [[Petrification|turned into stone]].<ref name="WBS">{{WBS}}</ref>
