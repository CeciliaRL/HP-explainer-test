'''Edgar Stroulger''' ([[1703]] – [[1798]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who invented the [[Sneakoscope]], a [[Dark Detector]] that lit up, spun, and whistled if someone was doing something untrustworthy nearby. For this accomplishment, he was commemorated on a bronze [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="COSG"/><ref name="POAG"/>

A [[portrait]] of Stroulger was placed on the sixth floor of [[Hogwarts Castle]], guarding a secret passageway. His [[password]] was "''Surreptitiousness''" in the [[1993–1994 school year]].<ref name="POAG" />

==Etymology==
The name "Edgar" is derived from the Old English elements ead "rich", "blessed" and gar "spear". This was the name of a 10th-century English king, who is regarded as a saint. The name did not survive long after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 18th century, in part due to a character by this name in Sir Walter Scott's novel ''The Bride of Lammermoor'' (1819).
