The '''Infant Demonic''' was a circus performer in the [[1920s]].

==Biography==
They were part of the [[Circus Arcanus]], a travelling freak show, which billed them as the "greatest freak of nature ever placed on exhibition." Based on a depiction of them on a poster, they were a congenitally deformed person with a [[devil]]-like tail and horns, and claw-like hands and feet.<ref name="poster">[http://store.minalima.com/shop/fantastic-beasts/limited-edition-prints/no-maj-street-posters/circus-arcanus-museum-of-human-oddities-poster/ MinaLima Store - Circus Arcanus - Museum of Human Oddities Poster] {{see image|File:Circus Arcanus.png}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The Infant Demonic's hands and feet resemble a condition known as {{w|Ectrodactyly}} where the fingers and toes are fused into claw-like extremities. The best known person with this condition was circus performer and convicted murderer {{W|Grady Stiles}} aka "The Lobster Boy".
*Considering the [[magic]]al nature of the Circus Arcanus, its possible that this individual was a magical [[beast]] or [[being]], possibly a kind of [[Demon]], given its name. However, circus performers and promoters are known to exaggerate and give performers enticing names that many not be accurate.
*Alternately they may have gained these features due to a curse or magical mishap, or even deliberately to enhance their strangeness for show purposes. However they may not have had these features at all, with the nature of circus promotion.
