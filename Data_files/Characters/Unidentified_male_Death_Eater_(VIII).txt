This '''individual[[Wizardkind|<nowiki/>]] '''(d. [[1 May]], [[1998]]) was a [[Dark Wizard]] and one of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]] who participated in the [[Second Wizarding War]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
This Death Eater was presumably born prior to [[1981]]. He would have been a [[half-blood]] or [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], as his master [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] was an extreme [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]] who despised and sought to eradicate [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] and [[Muggle-born]]s, along with [[blood traitor]]s. It is also highly possible that he fought for Voldemort during the [[First Wizarding War]]. 

===Second Wizarding War===
This Death Eater [[Raid on the Hogwarts Express|raided]] the [[Hogwarts Express]] on [[1 September]], [[1997]], in order to search the train for [[Harry Potter]] with [[Unidentified male bald Death Eater|another Death Eater]]. At the time, both the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] and [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] were under the control of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. He was, however, unsuccessful in his search for Potter, as he, along with [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], were on a mission to find and destroy Voldemort's [[Horcrux]]es at the time, and did not return to Hogwarts for their [[Seventh year|final year]] of education at the school.<ref>{{DH|F1}}</ref>

This Death Eater was at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] as [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Griphook]] staged a [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)|break-in]] to retrieve [[Helga Hufflepuff's Cup]] from the [[Lestrange Vault]].

Later that day, he was [[Killing Curse|killed]] by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in a fit of rage at [[Malfoy Manor]], after the Dark Lord was informed by the [[goblin]]s working at Gringotts that [[Harry Potter]] had managed to steal [[Helga Hufflepuff's Cup]] from the bank.<ref>{{DH|F2}}</ref>

==Magical Abilities and Skills==
* '''[[Wandless Magic]]''': This Death Eater was highly skilled at using [[magic]] without a [[wand]]. When searching for [[Harry Potter]] he was able to halt the [[Hogwarts Express]] simply with a hand gesture.
* '''[[Apparition]]''': He was able to apparate in front of the [[Hogwarts Express]].
* '''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, he would have been highly proficient in the dark arts and the casting of [[Dark charm|dark spells]] and most likely the [[Unforgivable Curses]].

==Behind the scenes==
*The Death Eater is portrayed by [[Jon Campling]] in {{DH|F1}} and in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]''.
