'''Lisa Cullen''' was a [[Gryffindor]]<ref name="house" /> [[Wizardkind|student]] attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]]. She competed in the school [[Exploding Snap]] tournament during the [[1996–1997 school year]].

==Etymology==
*Lisa means either "Oath of God" or "God is satisfacton" in Hebrew
*Cullen means "puppy or dog" in Gaelic and "holly" in Irish

==Behind the scenes==
*"Cullen" is also the surname of the main [[vampire]] clan in the popular ''Twilight'' series. [[Robert Pattinson]], who starred as male lead [[w:c:twilightsaga:Edward Cullen|Edward Cullen]] in the ''Twilight'' film adaptations, also played [[Cedric Diggory]] in {{GOF|FA}}. However, since Lisa Cullen first appeared in the PlayStation 2 version of the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|''Prisoner of Azkaban'' video game]], released in [[2004]], her surname would not be an homage to Edward Cullen, as the first ''Twilight'' book was released in [[2005]].
