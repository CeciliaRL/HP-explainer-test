This '''individual''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who, during his lifetime, was [[Head of Gryffindor House]].<ref name="MHP" />

==Biography==
A portrait of this wizard hung in [[Gryffindor Tower]]. He seemed to spend most of his time sleeping, although he was willing to speak to students if they woke him up. In [[1994]] when [[Harry Potter]] opened his [[golden egg]] he was terrified and was seen holding his hands over his ears. In [[1995]], the [[Golden Snitch]] from the [[Unidentified Gryffindor seeker|Quidditch Player]]'s portrait on the opposite wall made its way into the background of his picture, much to the [[Seeker]]'s annoyance. He seemed to have known [[James and Lily Potter]] when they were at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], as he spoke of their personalities and behaviour, and remarked on their son Harry's similarities in appearance.

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{OOTP}}, he was credited as '''GCR Portrait Male 2''', and was voiced by [[Tony Dudson]]. His portrait also appears in the [[Gryffindor]] [[Gryffindor Tower|Common Room]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{HBP}}, but does not speak.
*This portrait seems to have been based on a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b1/Charles_Robert_Darwin_by_John_Collier_cropped.jpg 1881 portrait of Charles Darwin], by [[Wikipedia:John Collier (artist)|John Collier]].
