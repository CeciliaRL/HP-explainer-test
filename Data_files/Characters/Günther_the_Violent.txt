The name Günther is from the Germanic name ''Gundahar'', derived from the elements ''gund'' "war" and ''hari'' "army, warrior". This was the name of a semi-legendary 5th-century Burgundian king. He appears in the Germanic saga the ''Nibelungenlied'' which has him married to the Icelandic queen Brünhild.
