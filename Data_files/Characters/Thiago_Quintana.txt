'''Thiago Quintana''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[wizardkind|wizard]].<ref name="pottermore-1920s">{{WW|1920s-wizarding-america-en}}</ref> He, along with [[Shikoba Wolfe]], [[Johannes Jonker]], and [[Violetta Beauvais]], was one of four [[wandmaker]]s who served [[North America]] in the early [[20th century]].<ref name="pottermore-1920s" />

==Biography==
Quintana's [[wand]]s caused a sensation when they were first introduced.<ref name="pottermore-1920s" /> Sleek and unusually long in design, they produced [[spell]]s of "force and elegance". They contained a single [[White River Monster spine|spine]] taken from the back of one of the [[White River Monster]]s native to [[Arkansas]].<ref name="pottermore-1920s" /> Initially, there were fears that the species was being over-fished, but the ecological impact was lessened by the fact that only Quintana knew how to lure the creatures.<ref name="pottermore-1920s" /> He fiercely guarded this secret up until his death, after which wands containing White River Monster spine [[wand core|cores]] were no longer made.<ref name="pottermore-1920s" />
