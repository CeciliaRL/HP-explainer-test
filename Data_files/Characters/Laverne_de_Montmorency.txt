{{Quote|Ravenclaw house has an illustrious history. Most of the greatest wizarding inventors and innovators were in our house, including... Laverne de Montmorency, a great pioneer of love potions....|[[Robert Hilliard]]|Pottermore}}
'''Laverne de Montmorency''' ([[1823]] – [[1893]]) was a [[19th century|nineteenth-century]] [[potioneer]], who invented a number of [[Love Potion|love potions]]. She appears on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="PSg" />

==Biography==
Laverne de Montmorency was born in [[1823]], somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]].<ref name="PSg">{{PS|G}}</ref>

In her youth, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from around [[1834]]-[[1841]], and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

After her graduation from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]], Laverne de Montmorency presumably studied further into [[Potion|Potion-making]], becoming an accomplished [[potioneer]] and an expert in [[Love Potion|love potions]]. She became famous for her invention of many such potions.<ref name="PSg" />

Ms. de Montmorency died in [[1893]], aged around 70. In her honour, her invention of many [[Love Potion|love potions]] was recorded on a Chocolate Frog Card.

On [[1 September]], [[1991]], [[Prefect]] [[Robert Hilliard]] welcomed the [[Ravenclaw]] [[first year]]s to [[Ravenclaw Tower]] with a short speech, in which he mentioned [[potioneer]] Laverne de Montmorency as one of the many notable Hogwarts students, who had been [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]], like them, into Ravenclaw.<ref name="pottermore"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Laverne was a highly accomplished professional [[Potioneer]] and was thus highly proficient in the art and [[science]] of potion-making, having successfully invented a number of [[Love Potion]]s in her lifetime. Given how Love Potions are particularly advanced brews, and that she was even featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]] for her impressive achievements, this shows her great level of expertise and talent in this branch of [[magic]].

==Etymology==
*"Laverne" is derived from a French place-name that includes the Gaulish word ''vern, ''meaning "[[alder]]." It is sometimes associated with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laverna Laverna], the Roman goddess of thieves, or the Latin adjective ''vernus, ''meaning "of spring."<ref>https://www.behindthename.com/name/laverne</ref>
*The {{wplink|House of Montmorency}} was one of the oldest and most distinguished noble families in France. [[Wikipedia:Montmorency, Val-d'Oise|Montmorency]] was also the name of the family's fiefdom. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montmorency_cherry Montmorency cherry] is a popular variety of sour cherries, cultivated in the United States.

==Behind the scenes==
*Despite this individual's [[Hag]]-like appearance in her [[Chocolate Frog Card]] picture, she was actually a [[human]] [[Wizardkind|witch]].
