This '''girl''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. She was injured in an unknown manner, probably from a [[spell]]. During the hour long break in which the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] ordered his [[Death Eaters]] to stop fighting, the girl was comforted by [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]]. She was scared and wanted to go home.<ref name="DH32">{{DH|B|32}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*As the girl is not known to be a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] or the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]], it can be assumed that she was at school prior to the event.
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (video game)|second video game adaptation]] of {{DH}} during ''Surrender'', [[Harry Potter]] came across some students while walking through the [[Viaduct Courtyard]]. One of them was a blonde-haired [[Hufflepuff]] girl with brown skin who says the same as this individual said. It is unknown if this is her, as she was not comforted by Ginny.
