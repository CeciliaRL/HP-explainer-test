'''Sloan Travers''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch or wizard]] who knew [[Constance Pickering]]. When they heard she was trying to be an [[Animagus]], they told her about a friend of a friend who had botched the [[Animagus Spell|spell]] and became a half wizard, half {{w|naked mole-rat}}. Constance then decided not to continue and did not drink the [[Animagus Potion|potion]] needed to complete the process.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}, [[Brilliant Event: The New Marauders]]</ref>
