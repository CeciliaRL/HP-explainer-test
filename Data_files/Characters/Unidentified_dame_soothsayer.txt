A witch also would most likely have not been legally allowed to publicly read the fortunes of Muggles with [[magic]], as such activity would have violated the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] for demonstrating magic in front of Muggles.</ref>

This '''dame''' was a woman who worked as a fortune teller. During her lifetime, she claimed to people that she could [[Divination|tell them their future]], for a nickel.<ref name="COGS86">{{COG|S|86}}</ref>

==History==
In her lifetime, she told people their future. At some point, she worked at a fair and used a [[crystal ball]], and wore a veil. [[Jacob Kowalski]] gave her a nickel and she told him his future, but she "missed out on quite a bit" according to him.<ref name="COGS86"/>
