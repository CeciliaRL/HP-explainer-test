'''Odbert''' was a [[Goblin]] who worked at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] at some point during [[1990]]. Like most goblins, he was rather suspicious of most [[Wizardkind|wizards]], including the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] students that visited the bank looking for [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]]. He did, however, appear quite friendly with his colleague and fellow goblin, [[Burgock]].<ref name="HM6">{{HM|6|THE DRAGON'S TREASURE|1}}</ref>
