'''[[Crispin Cronk]]'s sphinxes''' were several pet [[Sphinx]]es that [[Crispin Cronk]] insisted on keeping in his backyard.<ref name="PSG"/><ref name="COSG"/><ref name="POAG"/>

==History==
During the [[19th century]], the domestication and private ownership of [[Sphinx]]es was illegal and, after Cronk refused to hand his sphinxes over to the [[British Ministry of Magic]], the Ministry was forced to convict Cronk and send him to [[Azkaban]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

It is unknown what happened to Cronk's sphinxes after this point, however, it is presumed that they were taken into the care of the [[Beast Division]] of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] and returned to their native land of [[Egypt]].
