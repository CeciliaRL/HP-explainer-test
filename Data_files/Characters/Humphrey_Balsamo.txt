'''Humphrey Balsamo''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and shop assistant working at [[Slug & Jiggers Apothecary|Slug &amp; Jiggers]], a shop specialising in [[potion]]s and their ingredients in [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name="FBC"/>

==Biography==
At the time of Balsamo's employment at Slug & Jiggers, the apothecary was broken into and wrecked by what seemed to be a [[magic]]al [[beast]], thus prompting investigation by [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and her [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|partner]] from the [[Ministry of Magic]]'s [[Beast Division]].<ref name="FBC">{{FBC|6|2}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*In Latin, "''[[Wiktionary:balsamo|balsamo]]''" is a declension of the noun "''[[Wiktionary:balsamum|balsamum]]''", meaning balsam or balm, a sweet-smelling oil or soothing ointment derived from plants; it's a rather fitting surname for someone who works in an apothecary.
*[[Wikipedia:Alessandro Cagliostro|Giuseppe Balsamo]] (1743–1795), who is more commonly known by the assumed pseudonym and self-conferred title of "Count Alessandro di Cagliostro", was a noted charlatan and impostor who infiltrated several royal courts of Europe as a [[Wikipedia:Quackery|quack]] and self-styled magician.
