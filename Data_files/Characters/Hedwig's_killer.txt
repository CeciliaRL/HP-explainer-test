==Biography==
{{Quote|No! NO!|Harry yelling after Hedwig's death|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
[[File:Hedwig Death GIF.gif|250px|thumb|left|Hedwig gets hit and killed with the [[Killing Curse|Killing curse]]]]
This Death Eater shot out a [[Killing Curse]] that [[Death|killed]] [[Harry Potter]]'s pet [[owl]], [[Hedwig]]. It is likely the curse that killed [[Hedwig]] was intended for [[Rubeus Hagrid]] or Harry Potter.<ref name="DH4"/> He or she most likely took part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. It is also likely that, after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s defeat in [[1998]], this [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] was either killed or imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for their crimes as a Death Eater.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': This Death Eater was highly accomplished with dark magic, as they were able to successfully cast the [[Killing Curse]],<ref name="DH4"/> one of the [[Unforgivable Curses]] which required both willpower and [[magic]]al skill to perform.<ref name="GOF14">{{GOF|B|14}}</ref>
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': This Death Eater was an accomplished [[broomstick]] flyer, as they took part in the [[Battle of the Seven Potters]] on a broom.<ref name="DH4"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Hedwig's killer is not explicitly identified, so he/she may have appeared in other [[Harry Potter (book series)|books]], [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]] or [[Harry Potter video games|video games]], but the only known appearance is {{DH}} and {{DH|F1}}.
*According to the films, Hedwig's killer might have been [[Selwyn]], who was known to be pursuing Harry and Hagrid at the time since Hedwig's death in the film happened quite a while into the fight when there was only a couple death eaters following them, or it might have been [[Stanley Shunpike]] under the [[Imperius Curse]].
*Although Hedwig appeared to have been unintentionally struck by a stray Killing Curse meant for Harry or Hagrid in the book, Hedwig's killer in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|film adaptation]] is shown to deliberately aim the curse at Hedwig after she flew in their way.
