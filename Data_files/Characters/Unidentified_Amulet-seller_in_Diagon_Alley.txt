This '''individual''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who sold [[Amulet]]s in [[1996]] in [[Diagon Alley]].<ref name="HBP6"/>

==Biography==
In [[1996]], he tried to sell one to [[Molly Weasley]] to give to [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]], however [[Arthur Weasley]] threatened him with arrest.<ref name="HBP6">{{HBP|B|6}}</ref> He was one of many preying, in various ways, on the renewed fear which the [[Wizarding world|wizarding&nbsp;populace]] felt due to the recently acknowledged [[Return of Lord Voldemort|return]] of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters|followers]]. It is most likely therefore that the supposedly protective amulets he was selling were counterfeit goods which possessed no actual [[magic]]al properties.
