An '''ancestor''' of [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]], the [[Charms Master]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], was a [[goblin]].<ref name="jkr">[http://web.archive.org/web/20070724184245/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=95 Flitwick's background] on J.K. Rowling's Official Site</ref> Although Professor Flitwick was several generations removed from this individual, he still retained some goblin traits, notably a small stature.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[J. K. Rowling]] revealed on her [[J. K. Rowling's official site|website]] that Flitwick had a "dash" of [[goblin]] blood, suggesting only that his goblin ancestor would have been "something like a great, great, great grandfather."<ref name="jkr" /> It remains unknown exactly how far back the goblin ancestor was on Flitwick's family tree or which of Flitwick's parents carried the ancestry.
