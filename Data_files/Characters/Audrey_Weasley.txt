==Etymology==
The name Audrey is of Old English origin, and the meaning of Audrey is "noble strength". Also the root, via Saint Audrey, for the word "tawdry", due to lace and goods sold at Saint Audrey's Fair in England. Saint Audrey was a sixth-century English princess also known as Etheldreda. Literary: Shakespeare used the name for Touchstone's comic sweetheart in "As You Like It".
