'''Henry "Harry" Potter''' was either a [[pure-blood]] or [[Half-Blood|half-blood]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] who served on the [[Wizengamot]] from [[1913]] to [[1921]]. He was the father of [[Fleamont Potter]], the paternal grandfather of [[James Potter I|James Potter]], the great-grandfather of the famous [[Harry Potter]], and the great-great-grandfather of [[James Potter II|James Sirius]], [[Albus Potter|Albus Severus]], and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Luna Potter]].<ref name="Pottermore" />

==Biography==
Henry was born somewhere in [[England]] in or prior to [[1892]].<ref name="YOB" /> He was a direct descendant of [[Hardwin Potter|Hardwin]] and [[Iolanthe Peverell|Iolanthe Potter]] on his father's side.<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref> [[Henry Potter's mother|His mother]] was a member of the [[Fleamont family]].<ref name="Pottermore" /> It was her dying wish that Henry preserve her maiden name, which would otherwise die with her, and thus he named his son [[Fleamont Potter|Fleamont]].<ref name="Pottermore" />

Henry served as a member of the [[Wizengamot]] from [[1913]] to [[1921]].<ref name="Pottermore" /> He caused a minor controversy by publicly condemning the then-[[Minister for Magic]] [[Archer Evermonde]]'s decision to forbid the wizarding community from aiding [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s during the [[First World War]].<ref name="Pottermore" /> Henry's outspoken pro-Muggle views were one of the chief reasons for the [[Potter family]]'s exclusion from the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]].<ref name="Pottermore" />

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]] named their son, [[Harry Potter]], after him.
*In the American film ''{{wplink|It's a Wonderful Life}}'' (director {{wplink|Frank Capra}}, 1946), "[[Wikipedia:Mr Potter|Henry F. Potter]]" is the name of the antagonist, whose mannerisms are much akin to [[Lucius Malfoy]].
