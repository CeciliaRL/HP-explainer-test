'''Cedrella Weasley''' (née '''Black''') was a [[pure-blood]] witch, the second eldest daughter of [[Arcturus Black II]] and [[Lysandra Yaxley|Lysandra Black]], and sister of [[Charis Black|Charis]] and [[Callidora Black|Callidora]].

Cedrella married [[Septimus Weasley]]. The [[Weasley family]] had been considered [[blood traitor]]s ever since they protested their inclusion in the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]], and so, due to her marriage, Cedrella was disowned and burned off the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]].<ref name="BFT"/>

Cedrella and Septimus had three sons, one of whom is [[Arthur Weasley]]. Through Cedrella, the [[Weasley family]] is related not only to the Black family, but also to the [[Crouch family|Crouch]] and [[Longbottom family|Longbottom]] families.<ref name="BFT" /> Through [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]], she has seven grandchildren.

==Etymology==
''Cedrella'' is a rare feminine variant of "Cedric", which in turn is derived from the Old Celtic name ''Caratacos'', which means "[[love]]".<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/submit/name/cedrella BehindTheName.com]</ref>

''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cedrela Cedrela] ''is also a genus in the mahogany family, native to the New World. ''Cedrela odorata'' is a timber wood often sold under the name "Spanish-cedar" even though it is neither Spanish nor a cedar. It is used in the making of cigar boxes and guitars as well as general construction work.

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Horace Slughorn]] claimed that the Blacks were almost exclusively sorted into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]],<ref>{{HBP}}</ref> thus Cedrella might be considered an example of a "good Slytherin" for her non-biased views about [[Blood status|blood purity]]. Given that she was born between [[1915]] and [[1919]], she would have most likely been one of the first students of Slughorn's at some point, as Slughorn began his teaching career in [[1931]].
*Cedrella’s older sister Callidora was born in 1915, and her younger sister Charis was born in 1919, so Cedrella must have been born sometime between late 1915 and early 1919.
*Cedrella had three sons. One of them was [[Arthur Weasley|Arthur]], and it is possible that another one was [[Bilius]].
*On the family tree, Cedrella is depicted next to her sisters. She looks similar to her great-aunt [[Iola Black|Iola]], who was likewise disowned due to her marriage.
*Cedrella is similar to [[Andromeda Tonks]], who, like Cedrella, was the middle of three daughters and married against her family's wishes while her elder and younger sisters made "respectable" [[Pure-blood|pureblood]] [[marriage]]s.
