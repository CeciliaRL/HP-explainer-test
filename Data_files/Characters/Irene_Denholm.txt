==Etymology==
The name "Irene" is from Greek Ειρηνη (''Eirene''), derived from a word meaning "peace". This was the name of the Ancient Greek goddess who personified peace, one of the ‘Ωραι (''Horai''). It was also borne by several early Christian saints. The name was common in the Byzantine Empire, notably being borne by an 8th-century Empress, Eirene Sarantapechaina (reigned 797 - 802) who was the first woman to lead the Empire. She originally served as regent for her son Constantine VI, but later had him blinded and killed and ruled alone.
