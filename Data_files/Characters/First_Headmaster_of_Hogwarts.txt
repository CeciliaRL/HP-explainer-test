{{Quote|One statue is of Hogwarts' first headmaster: the founders were professors, none was ever a headmaster...|Description|The Wizarding World of Harry Potter}}

This '''individual''' (fl. ''circa'' [[11th century]]) was the first [[Headmaster|Head]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], as none of the [[Hogwarts founders|Founders]] ever held that title.<ref name="LTC">[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2010/3/25/wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-to-open-june-18-details-about-hogwarts-emerge Wizarding World of Harry Potter Grand Opening June 18: Details About Hogwarts Emerge] at [http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/ The Leaky Cauldron]</ref> It is unknown how he came about to be Headmaster, but a statue of him was kept inside the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]] in his memory.<ref name="LTC" />

==Biography==
[[File:Studying.png|100px|thumb|left|Some [[Unidentified studying girls|girls]] by his statue]]
During the [[1992–1993 school year]], a [[Unidentified studying girls|group of girls]] were seen studying and reading books by his statue, before [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] passed and they looked up.

In [[1998]], his statue replaced by the one of the [[Architect of Hogwarts]] at the [[Entrance Hall]]. It is presumed the statue was destroyed in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], as the ceiling above it came to collapse and, later on in the battle, all that was in the spot was a pile of rubble.<ref name="DHpt2vg">{{DH|G2}}</ref> For unknown reasons, a statue of him was stored in the [[Room of Requirement|Room of Hidden Things]].<ref name="DHpt2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>
