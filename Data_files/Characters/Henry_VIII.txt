'''Henry VIII''' ([[28 June]] [[1491]] – [[28 January]] [[1547]]) was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] who reigned as [[King]] of [[England]] from [[1509]] until his death.<ref name="wikipedia">"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VIII_of_England Henry VIII of England]" on Wikipedia</ref>

==Biography==
His second wife, [[Anne Boleyn]], was believed to have been a [[wizardkind|witch]] by [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s, but may have actually been a [[Squib]].<ref>Fifth question of the Third [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test|W.O.M.B.A.T.]] at {{JKRS}}.</ref>

[[Mary I]] was his daughter by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, whom he [[divorce]]d.<ref name="wikipedia" /> [[Elizabeth I]] was Henry's daughter by [[Anne Boleyn]].<ref name="wikipedia" />

==Etymology==
The name "Henry" comes from the Germanic name Heimirich which meant "home ruler", composed of the elements heim "home" and ric "power, ruler". It was later commonly spelled Heinrich, with the spelling altered due to the influence of other Germanic names like Haganrich, in which the first element is hagan "enclosure".
