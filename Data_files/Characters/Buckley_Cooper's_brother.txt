'''Mr Cooper''' was the brother of [[Buckley Cooper]] The two had a long-running feud, which escalated to the point that, after Mr Cooper sent Buckley a [[curse]]d [[broomstick]], Buckley wrote to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' asking whether it would be advisable to kidnap Mr Cooper's [[Cooper children|children]] and [[transfiguration|turn]] them into [[vampire|blood-sucking]] [[ferret]]s.<ref name="DP">[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[1 June]], [[1999]], Problem Page</ref>
