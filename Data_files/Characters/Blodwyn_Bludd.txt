'''Blodwyn Bludd''' (b. [[1923]]), also known as the '''Vampire from the Valleys''', was a [[vampire]] singer from the [[Valleys]] region of [[Wales]]. He was famous for his bass-baritone voice and for singing to his victims before sinking his fangs into their necks.<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This character's name was clearly constructed primarily as a play on the word "blood," since Blodwyn is actually a girl's name, and means "white flowers" in Welsh.<ref>"[http://www.behindthename.com/name/blodwen Blodwen]" on Behind the Name</ref> The surname, using correct Welsh pronunciation, would lose its vampiric connotations, as it would be pronounced "Bleeth" (th as in 'the', not as in 'teeth').
