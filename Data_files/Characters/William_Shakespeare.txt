'''William Shakespeare''' ([[23 April]], [[1564]]—[[23 April]], [[1616]]) was an [[England|English]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] poet and playwright, best known for his works of comedy, tragedy and romance.

==Biography==
During his lifetime, he wrote ''[[As You Like It]]'', ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', ''[[Coriolanus]]'', among many others. He lived during [[wikipedia:Elizabethan period|Elizabethan times]] in southern [[England]], when [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s as a whole were prejudiced against [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] and often organised massive witchhunts, partly inspired by regal paranoia.

There is a bust of Shakespeare on the pediment of [[Wyndham's Theatre]], depicting him flanked by muses and [[cherub]]s.<ref>{{WWHP}} {{see image|File:ShakespeareWyndham's.png}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The lyrics of ''[[Double Trouble|Something Wicked This Way Comes]]'', as heard in {{POA|FA}}, were taken from Shakespeare's ''Macbeth''. Thus, Shakespeare is credited with the lyrics. Additionally, [[Harry Potter (book series)|''Harry Potter'' series]] author [[J. K. Rowling]] has stated "I absolutely adore ''Macbeth''. It is possibly my favourite Shakespeare play."<ref name="leakymugglenet">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-3.htm The Leaky Cauldron and Mugglenet Interview]</ref>
*In the 2011 film ''[[Wikipedia:Anonymous (film)|Anonymous]]'', Shakespeare is portrayed by [[wikipedia:Rafe Spall|Rafe Spall]], son of [[Timothy Spall]] ([[Peter Pettigrew]]). In this film Shakespeare is portrayed as a drunken, inarticluate buffoon, and a fraud. The film identifies [[Wikipedia:Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford|Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]], as the true author of Shakespeare's alleged works. de Vere is portrayed in the film by [[Jamie Campbell Bower]] ([[Gellert Grindelwald]]) as a young man and [[Rhys Ifans]] ([[Xenophilius Lovegood]]) as an older man. [[David Thewlis]] ([[Remus Lupin]]) plays [[Wikipedia:William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]]. [[Henry Lloyd-Hughes]] ([[Roger Davies]]) appears as a bear baiter.
*In 2011 [[Ralph Fiennes]] ([[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]) made his directorial debut with a modern-day adaptation of Shakespeare's ''[[Wikipedia:Coriolanus|Coriolanus]]'', in which he also played the title role.
*[[J. K. Rowling]] has referred to the [[Encyclopaedia of Potterworld|Harry Potter Encyclopedia]] as "The Scottish Book" which is a reference to Shakespeare's play ''[[wikipedia:Macbeth|Macbeth]]'', which is sometimes referred to as "The Scottish Play".<ref name="J. K. Rowling's Official Site">[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view.cfm?id=123 J. K. Rowling's Official Site]</ref>
*[[Kenneth Branagh]] ([[Gilderoy Lockhart]]) and [[Emma Thompson]] ([[Sybill Trelawney]]) both appear in Branagh's 1989 adaptation of ''Henry V'', which also features [[Robbie Coltrane]] ([[Rubeus Hagrid]]) as Falstaff in a cameo appearance.
*In the [[1996]] film adaptation of Shakespeare's ''Hamlet'', Branagh plays the title character Hamlet, [[Ray Fearon]] ([[Firenze]]) plays Francisco, [[Timothy Spall]] ([[Peter Pettigrew|Wormtail]]) plays Rosencrantz, and [[Julie Christie]] ([[Rosmerta]]) plays Gertrude. Branagh, also, was portrays characters in other Shakespeare films -- ''Much Ado About Nothing ''(Benedick) and ''Othello ''(Iago), for example.
*In ''Much Ado About Nothing'', Thompson plays Beatrice, Benedick's love interest. This is ironic, as Branagh and Thompson were actually married at the time. [[Imelda Staunton]] ([[Dolores Umbridge]]) also makes an appearance in this film as Margaret.
*In the [[1990]] film adaptation of ''Hamlet'', [[Helena Bonham Carter]] ([[Bellatrix Lestrange]]) plays Ophelia.
*Both Branagh and Spall return in ''Love's Labour's Lost'', as Berowne and Don Armado respectively.
*In the [[1965]] adaptation of ''Othello'', where [[Michael Gambon]] ([[Albus Dumbledore]]) made his film debut, [[Maggie Smith]] ([[Minerva McGonagall]]) plays Desdemona. Gambon also made his TV debut in a Shakespeare work, ''Much Ado About Nothng''. Smith returned to Shakespeare thirty years later, in ''Richard III''.
*In the [[2009]] adaptation of ''Hamlet'', [[David Tennant]] ([[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Bartemius Crouch, Jnr]]) stars as the title character, Hamlet.
*[[Ralph Fiennes]] ([[Tom Riddle]]) acted in several stage productions of Shakespeare's work, including ''A Midsummer Night's Dream ''and ''Romeo and Juliet''.
*In the TV miniseries adaptation of ''Julius Caesar'', [[Richard Harris]] (Dumbledore) plays Lucius Sulla. It should be noted that this was one of the last few films of Harris before his death.
*[[Alan Rickman]] ([[Severus Snape]]) made his film debut in the [[1978]] film adaptation of ''Romeo and Juliet''.

==Etymology==
The name "William" comes from the Germanic name Willahelm, which was composed of the elements wil "will, desire" and helm "helmet, protection".
