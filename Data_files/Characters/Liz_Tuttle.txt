'''Liz "Lizard" Tuttle'''<ref name="Polyjuice"/> was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1984]] and was Sorted into [[Slytherin]]. She chose [[Care of Magical Creatures]] as one of her electives.<ref name="HM41cmc">{{HM|4|1|cmc}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Hogwarts years {{c|1984–1991}}===
Liz began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on [[1 September|1st of September]] [[1984]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin]]. Liz owned a male [[frog]] named [[Sir Ribbithe]].<ref name="Y6Ch5">{{HM|6|5}}</ref>

====Third year====
<!-- DO NOT WRONGFULLY label this as Year 4 again! Writer and CONTENT confirmed it to be Year 3. -->
[[File:Liz Tuttle - Hogwarts Mystery.png|140px|thumb|left|Liz Tuttle taking notes during a Care of Magical Creatures class]]
During her third year, Liz took [[Care of Magical Creatures]]<ref name="HM41cmc"/> and [[Divination (class)|Divination]]<ref name="HM62d"/> as electives. She befriended [[Hufflepuff]] [[Penny Haywood]] at some point during her year, before meeting [[Jacob's sibling|a friend of Penny's]], who was looking for ingredients for [[Polyjuice Potion]]. Liz pointed her wand at the person and demanded them to choose between the [[Billywig]], [[Bowtruckle]] and [[Bundimun]].<ref name="Polyjuice"/>

====Fourth year====
In the first [[Care of Magical Creatures]] class during the [[1987–1988 school year]], aside from [[Barnaby Lee]], Liz appeared to be one of the friendlier Slytherin students, who showed genuine interest in the course. She exclaimed to not having seen anything as beautiful as a [[Fire crab|Fire Crab]] shooting [[Fire|flame]] out its rear.<ref name="HM41cmc"/>

She later mentioned during another Care of Magical Creatures class that she had attended a luau in [[Fiji]] where Fire Crabs were used.<ref name="HM411cmc">{{HM|4|11|cmc}}</ref>

====Fifth year====
When [[Jacob's sibling]] went to talk to the [[Bloody Baron]] to ask about [[Duncan Ashe]], Liz joined them along with fellow Slytherins [[Barnaby Lee]], [[Merula Snyde]] and [[Ismelda Murk]]. Liz thought Barnaby's jokes involving the word "bloody" were funny.<ref name="Y5Ch6">{{HM|5|6}}</ref>

====Sixth year====
During the [[1989–1990 school year]], her [[sixth year]], Liz proceeded to take [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] level [[Potions (class)|Potions]], [[History of Magic]], [[Care of Magical Creatures]] and [[Divination (class)|Divination]].

Sometime during the year, she became a founding member of the [[Circle of Khanna]], a group devoted to avenging [[Rowan Khanna]] and locating the final [[Cursed Vaults|cursed vault]]. It was at the groups first meeting in the [[Hog's Head Inn]] that she learned of the malevolent organisation "[[R]]" and its [[Plot to find the Cursed Vaults|motives]] to locate the final Cursed Vault before them.<ref name="hm20"/>

==Personality and traits==
She was socially awkward and had difficulty with befriending others, and most other students viewed her as weird. She loved [[magic]]al [[creature]]s and had the desire to become a [[Magizoologist]] like [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]].<ref name="Polyjuice"/> She cared deeply the well-being of creatures: she was afraid the [[blood]] on the [[Bloody Baron]] was the blood of an animal,<ref name="Y5Ch6"/> and she was known to object to animal-to-object [[Transfiguration]]s.<ref name="HM716t">{{HM|7|16|t}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Liz achieved an '[[Outstanding]]' in her O.W.L. [[Potions (class)|Potions]] exam, meaning she was able to advance to the N.E.W.T.-level Potions class taught by [[Severus Snape]], showing considerable talent in this field.<ref name="HM63p">{{HM|6|3|p}}</ref>
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': From an early age, Liz was highly passionate about [[Magizoology]] and started studying Care of Magical Creatures from her [[third year]] onward.<ref name="HM41cmc"/> She later earned either an "[[Exceeds Expectations]]" or "[[Outstanding]]" grade in her [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]], as she studied the subject at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]], showing considerable proficiency in this field.
*'''[[Divination]]''': Whilst not being a natural born [[Seer]] like her [[Liz Tuttle's mother|mother]], Liz was still talented in the art of Divination in her own right, as she earned a high enough grade at O.W.L. in the [[Divination (class)|subject]] which allowed her to study it at N.E.W.T. level.<ref name="HM62d">{{HM|6|2|d}}</ref>
*'''[[History of Magic]]''': Liz was knowledgeable and proficient in the study of magical history, as she was able to study the subject at N.E.W.T. level.

==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|Liz ‘Lizard’ Tuttle is a Slytherin who's main ambition is to make sure all creatures are treated equally. If you're having trouble with an animal-oriented ingredient or have any creature questions, Liz has the answers.|Liz's character description|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
*In {{HM}}, players who advanced into Year 4 prior to [[12 July]], [[2018‎]], would first meet Liz in Year 4; this is due to the belated released Side Quest "Polyjuice Potion," which actually chronologically happened in Year 3.<ref>[https://twitter.com/themattlondon/status/1017507520498167808 Yes it’s year 3 also. You’ll see scenes that confirm it. I wrote polyjuice and NHN at the same time.] by [https://.twitter.com/themattlondon Matt London on Twitter]</ref>
*In {{HM}}, during the "Search for Odour" part of the Care of Magical Creatures class, when clicking "Sniff Liz," the speech bubble "Lizard smells like lake water and hay" would appear; indicating either her full first name or nickname is "Lizard," or it is a typo.<ref>[https://78.media.tumblr.com/32f26dfb8fdf553bc0f8ebac4095349d/tumblr_pa1mdxacS41xvxadjo4_540.jpg see this image]</ref> It was later revealed that Lizard was in fact her nickname.<ref name="Polyjuice"/>
*Liz Tuttle was used in the Rotate Puzzle game on Novel Games on 13 July 2019.
*During the Talk to Liz section of Thestral Care of Magical Creatures classes, Liz can mention wanting to request meat-free sandwiches for meals, which suggests she might be a vegetarian or vegan.
