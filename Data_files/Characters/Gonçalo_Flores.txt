}}'''Gonçalo Flores'''<ref name="the-qwc2014-final">[[2014 Quidditch World Cup final]] (Archived from {{PM}})</ref> was a [[Brazil]]ian [[wizardkind|wizard]] and a [[Chaser]] for the [[2014]] [[Brazilian National Quidditch team]], along with [[Alejandra Alonso]] and [[Fernando Diaz]].

==Biography==
All three Chasers were highly commended for their performance during both the Brazil versus [[Haitian National Quidditch team|Haiti]] match, where they made thirty attempts to score during the beginning of the game, as well as during the Brazil versus [[Welsh National Quidditch team|Wales]] match where [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]] complimented them on their solid performance and ability to keep their heads during the most contentious game in the tournament up to that point.<ref name="Insider">[http://insider.pottermore.com/2014/05/read-ginny-potters-match-reports-from.html "Read Ginny Potter's match reports from the 2014 Quidditch World Cup every day this week"] at [http://insider.pottermore.com Pottermore Insider]</ref>

According to Ginny, her son [[Albus Potter]] was a fan of Flores, and thus supported Brazil in the finals, unlike his father and siblings. At one point during the match, Flores scored and Albus nearly fell out of the [[VIP Box Two|VIP box]] in excitement, but was caught by his uncle [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] (this account comes, however, from [[Rita Skeeter]], so it must be taken with a grain of salt, as it is likely somewhat exaggerated).
