'''Cedric''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the early [[1990s]]. In [[1991]], he borrowed a [[quill|writing quill]] from a [[Girl whose quill was taken by Cedric|female Hufflepuff student]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}} - GBA version</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is highly likely that this individual is [[Cedric Diggory]], as he would have been in his [[third year]].

==Etymology==
The name "Cedric" was invented by Sir Walter Scott for a character in his novel ''Ivanhoe'' (1819). Apparently he based it on the actual name Cerdic, the name of the semi-legendary founder of the kingdom of Wessex in the 6th-century. The meaning of Cerdic is uncertain, but it does not appear to be Old English in origin.
