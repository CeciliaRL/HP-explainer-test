This '''unnamed [[Ireland|Irish]] man''' met [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in the [[Leaky Cauldron]] in [[1990]]. He sold Hagrid the [[Fluffy|three-headed dog]] he owned. Hagrid named this dog [[Fluffy]], and, the [[1991|following year]], lent him to [[Albus Dumbledore]], who used him to guard the [[Philosopher's Stone]].<ref name="PSF">{{PS|F}} - Chapter 26 (''Up to Something'')</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the novel {{PS}}, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] states that he bought [[Fluffy]] from "a [[Greece|Greek]] [[Greek man|man]]", rather than "an Irish feller,". Because of this change in the film, it loses [[J. K. Rowling]]'s reference to [[Wikipedia:Greek mythology|Greek mythology]], in which there was a three-head dog, [[Wikipedia:Cerberus|Cerberus]], that guarded the gates of [[Wikipedia:Hades|Hades]]. However, [[Steve Kloves]], the film's screenwriter, stated that he originally used "Greek chappie," but did not know how the line got changed.<ref>[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/books/ps/rg-ps11.html Reader's Guide to Chapter 11 of ''Philosopher's Stone''] on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref>
