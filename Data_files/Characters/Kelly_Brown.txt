'''Kelly Brown''' (b. [[8 June]], [[1982]]) is a professional rugby union player who plays as a [[Wikipedia:Flanker (rugby union)|flanker]], and has captained the [[Scottish rugby team]] since [[2012]].<ref name="Wikipedia">{{Wikilink|Kelly Brown}}</ref> He may be related to the wizarding [[Brown family]], possibly having [[Lavender Brown]] for a cousin.<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|scottish-rugby}}</ref>

In [[2014]], Kelly Brown, along with [[Jim Hamilton]] and [[Stuart Hogg]], came under suspect, among [[wizarding world|wizarding circles]], of actually being a talented [[Squib]]. While there is no wizarding rule which prevents a squib from actually playing on a muggle team, the act of smuggling a squib into the team, which is the rumoured mission of the [[Wizarding Supporters of Scottish Rugby Union|WSSRU]], is in violation of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] which prohibits wizards from participating in muggle sport.<ref name="Pottermore"/>
