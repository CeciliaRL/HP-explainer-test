'''Elsie Prod''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived in [[Didsbury]], [[England]] in late [[1992]]<ref name="COS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref> and was the wife of [[Demetrius Prod]].

==Biography==
Sometime prior to [[January]] [[1992]], her husband wrote to [[Kwikspell Company]], and a month thereafter managed to [[Human to yak spell|turn Elsie into a yak]]; he wrote an advertisement for the Kwikspell Company, proud of this feat. [[Harry Potter]] and [[Argus Filch]] would later read about this.<ref name="COS8" />

On the eve of [[27 November]], [[1998]]<ref>[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[8 February]], [[1999]], Page 2</ref> after supper, Demetrius and Elsie got into an argument over the washing-up. He died that night, described by the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' to have been "noisily". His obituary claimed Elise "sadly missed"<ref>https://www.hp-lexicon.org/source/other-canon/dp/dp2/</ref> her husband, despite seemingly not getting along well with him.
