'''John Buchanan'''<ref name="name">[https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/XYK5-Q6P "Scotland, Births and Baptisms, 1564-1950," index, FamilySearch, Angus Buchanan, 15 Jan 1847]</ref> (c. [[1804]] - [[1 July]], [[1861]])<ref name="dates">[http://www.geni.com/people/John-Buchanan/6000000004044562628 "John Buchanan, Provost of Inveraray"] at [http://www.geni.com/family-tree/start Geni]</ref> was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] who lived in the [[19th century]]. He was the husband of [[Angus Buchanan's mother|Mrs Buchanan]] and the father of eleven children, including [[Hamish Buchanan|Hamish]], [[Flora Buchanan|Flora]], and [[Angus Buchanan|Angus]].<ref name="PM"/>

==Biography==
The [[Buchanan family|Buchanans]] were a [[wizardkind|wizarding]] family with a long history. By the mid-[[19th century]], they had resided in a village in the [[Scottish Borders]] for many generations and were shunned by their [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours, who did not know that they were [[magic]]al. They had a reputation for being extremely large, aggressive, and drinking excessively, which lead the Muggle villagers to conclude that Buchanan children were sent to correctional facilities or institutionalised when they [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|mysteriously disappeared at eleven]].<ref name="PM"/>

Mr Buchanan and [[Angus Buchanan's mother|his wife]] had a noisy, chaotic home filled with eleven children. Described as a "fierce" and "proud" man, he held strong anti-[[Squib]] views, boasting that no Squib had ever been born into the Buchanan line, and asserting that the birth of a Squib meant that a wizarding family was "in decline" and deserved to be "winnowed out." However, he and his wife did not notice when their third-born son, [[Angus Buchanan|Angus]], failed to display signs of magical ability like all of his other siblings.<ref name="PM"/>

Angus, being the kindest and largest of the Buchanan children, was well-liked by his brothers and sisters. Mr Buchanan's children thus went to elaborate lengths to conceal Angus's Squib status from him and his wife. His daughter [[Flora Buchanan|Flora]] forged a [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|acceptance letter]] for her younger brother, and, on [[1 September]], [[1858]], the day that eleven-year-old Angus was due to begin his [[first year]] at Hogwarts, his son [[Hamish Buchanan|Hamish]] carried his little brother to [[Hogwarts Castle]] on his [[Hamish Buchanan's broomstick|broomstick]].<ref name="PM"/>

The ruse was revealed when the [[Sorting Hat]] declined to sort Angus. News soon reached Mr Buchanan and his wife by [[owl]]. Humiliated, he refused to allow his son into the house when he finally arrived home on foot, telling him never to show his face again and chasing him away with [[curse]]s.<ref name="PM"/>

After his disownment, Angus made his own way in the Muggle world, eventually coming to play for the [[Scottish rugby team]]. Mr Buchanan forbade his other children from ever seeing Angus again, but, despite this, all ten of them turned out to support their brother at the Scottish team's first international match.<ref name="PM">{{WW|scottish-rugby}}</ref>
