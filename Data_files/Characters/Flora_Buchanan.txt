'''Flora Buchanan''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[wizardkind|witch]] who lived in the [[19th century]]. She was the daughter of [[Angus Buchanan's father|Mr]] and [[Angus Buchanan's mother|Mrs Buchanan]] and the older sister of [[Angus Buchanan]].<ref name="PM"/>

==Biography==
Born into the [[wizardkind|wizarding]] [[Buchanan family]] sometime in the mid-[[19th century]], Flora grew up in a village in the [[Scottish Borders]] with ten siblings, including [[Hamish Buchanan|Hamish]] and [[Angus Buchanan|Angus]] (the latter of whom, at least, was younger than her). The Buchanan children had a reputation for being rowdy and large. Flora and her sisters won the village [[tug-of-war]] competition every year.<ref name="PM"/>

When Flora turned eleven, she received a [[Hogwarts acceptance letter]], and began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. The local [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] villagers, who were unaware of the Buchanan family's [[magic]]al heritage, assumed that she had been sent to a corrective facility or mental institution. It is unknown which [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] she was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into whilst she attended Hogwarts.<ref name="PM"/>

Flora and her other siblings were especially fond of their brother Angus. Since [[Angus Buchanan's father|their father]] was highly prejudiced against [[Squib]]s, Flora and her siblings covered for Angus when, unlike them, he displayed no signs of [[magic]]al ability. After no Hogwarts acceptance letter arrived for Angus, Flora forged one for him, thus keeping their parents in the dark for a few more weeks.<ref name="PM">{{WW|scottish-rugby}}</ref>
