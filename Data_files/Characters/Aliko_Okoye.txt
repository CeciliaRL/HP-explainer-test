'''Aliko Okoye''' was a [[Nigeria]]n [[Wizardkind|witch]] who played as a [[Beater]] for the [[2014]] [[Nigerian National Quidditch team]].

==Biography==
During the second match of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]], against [[Fijian National Quidditch team|Fiji]], Okoye and her fellow Beater [[Mercy Ojukwu]] were more "ferocious" than the Fijian Beaters, [[Quintia Qarase]] and [[Narinder Singh]]. This resulted in the [[Bludger]]s doing much harm to the Fijian [[Chaser]]s, which contributed to that team's bruising defeat.<ref name="PM1">[[NIGERIA VERSUS FIJI]] (Archived from {{PM}})</ref>

During the fourth quarter-final match, against [[Japanese National Quidditch team|Japan]], Okoye, along with fellow Beater [[Mercy Ojukwu|Ojukwu]], put on a master class of Bludger work, as did rival Beaters [[Shintaro Shingo|Shingo]] and [[Masaki Hongo|Hongo]]. It was for this reason that special [[Quidditch]] correspondent to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]] called the match the "''Battle of the Beaters''".<ref name="PM2">{{PM}} - [[JAPAN VERSUS NIGERIA|JAPAN_VERSUS_NIGERIA]] (Archived)</ref>
