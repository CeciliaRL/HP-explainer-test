The '''Sea Serpent of Cromer''' was a [[sea serpent]] which lived off the coast of [[Cromer]], [[Norfolk]]. It was slain by [[Glanmore Peakes]] during the early [[18th century|eighteenth century]].<ref>[[Glanmore Peakes]]'s Chocolate Frog Card in {{PS|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is never revealed why Peakes slayed the Sea Serpent of Cromer, as [[Sea serpent|Sea Serpents]] are regarded as docile creatures that pose no threat to [[human]]s (despite hysterical [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] accounts of their ferocious behaviour). It could be that this particular serpent had an unusually aggressive demeanour, or that it wasn't strictly a Sea Serpent, but rather an aggressive relative, like the [[Selma]].<ref>{{FB|E}} - ''An A-Z of Fantastic Beasts''</ref>
