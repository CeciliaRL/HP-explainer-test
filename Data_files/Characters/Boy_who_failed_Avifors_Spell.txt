This '''boy''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] sometime in or before the early [[1990s]]. Once during his [[first year]] during [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] he used the [[Avifors Spell]] but was only able to turn things into [[egg]]s. He later tried to practise during breakfast and became very popular because of his failed attempts.<ref>{{PS|G}} - GBA version</ref>
