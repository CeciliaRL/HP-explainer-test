A [[Hufflepuff]] student in her early years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], Lufkin became the first woman ever to hold the office and was elected at least twice, serving from [[1798]] to [[1811]].

==Etymology==
*Artemisia is a feminine form of Artemisios,<ref>"[http://www.behindthename.com/name/artemisia Artemisia]" on Behind the Name</ref> a Greek name which derived from [[Wikipedia:Artemis|Artemis]],<ref>"[http://www.behindthename.com/name/artemisios Artemisios]" on Behind the Name</ref> the name of the Greek maiden daughter of Zeus and Leto, and the twin sister of Apollo. She is the goddess of the moon, hunting, the wilderness, and the gift of taming wild animals.<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis Artemis]" on Wikipedia</ref>
*[[Wikipedia:Artemisia (genus)|Artemisia]] is also the name of a [[Wikipedia:Genus|genus]] of plants that includes [[Wikipedia:Sagebrush|sagebrush]] and [[wormwood]].<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_(genus) Artemisia (genus)]" on Wikipedia</ref>
*[[Wikipedia:Artemisia Gentileschi|Artemisia Gentileschi]] was a pioneering Italian painter of the [[Wikipedia:Baroque|Baroque]] movement, the first woman to join the [[Wikipedia:Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze]], as well as one of the first to handle religious and historical subjects.<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemisia_Gentileschi Artemisia Gentileschi]" on Wikipedia</ref>
*Lufkin is a pet form of the Middle English given name Love,<ref>"[http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Lufkin-family-history-sct.ashx Lufkin]" on Ancestry.com</ref> which derived from either the Old English girl's name ''Lufu'', meaning "[[love]]", or its masculine equivalent ''Lufa''.<ref>"[http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Love-family-history-sct.ashx Love]" on Ancestry.com</ref>
**The meaning of her surname is rather curious and ironic, considering "''Lufa-Lufa''" is the Portuguese name for Hufflepuff, the house she was sorted in, and the suffix 'kin' is often used to refer to a person's children. In other words, her surname can be rather fittingly interpreted as "child of Hufflepuff".

==Behind the scenes==
*Artemisia as depicted on her Chocolate Frog Card has an uncanny resemblance to Lady Tremaine as depicted in the Walt Disney animated film Cinderella released in 1950.
