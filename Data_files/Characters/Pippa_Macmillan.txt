==Biography==
During her second year at Hogwarts, Pippa could be seen sitting with [[Ismelda Murk]] by the fountain in the [[Courtyard]].

In her [[third year]], during a full [[moon]] in late [[September]] or [[October]], she was attacked by a white [[creature]] in the [[Forbidden Forest]], thinking that it was a [[Werewolf]]. She reported to [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]], who treated her in the [[Hospital Wing]].<ref name="HM2"/> Using a [[Memory Potion]] with the help of [[Chiara Lobosca]] and [[Jacob's sibling]], she found out that the creature was actually a [[Hippogriff]] and that she had been scratched by a tree branch in the process of fleeing from it.<ref>{{HM|2|Packmates|3}}</ref>

*Pippa's physical appearance is one of the often-seen NPCs in {{HM}}.
*Despite the fact that other dialogue in the "Chiara" Achievement is year adjusted, Pippa is still stated to be a [[third year]] regardless of the player's year.
*She is a possible relative of [[Ernest Macmillan]].
