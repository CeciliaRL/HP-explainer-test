'''Poonima Shah''' was a [[Slytherin]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]]. She was seen walking around the school during the [[1993-1994 school year]].

==Etymology==

Poonima means 'full moon' in Sanskrit. The Indian surname 
"Shah" is mistakenly thought that it is derived from the Persian "Shah" meaning "King". It is derived from Sanskrit Sadhu (meaning gentleman) and Prakrit Sahu, while the actual spelling "Shah" in Western culture was popularised by the title of the former Persian King. In the Gujarat and Rajasthan region, the surname Shah derives from the varnacular sah (from Sanskrit Sadhu, "merchant"). 


==Behind the scenes==
