{{Quote|Oh, yes, very interesting — plenty of smarts, bit of bravery, too. There's talent, of course — and something more.|The [[Sorting Hat]] regarding this student whilst [[Sorting ceremony|sorting]] them|Harry Potter: Magic Awakened}}
This '''individual''' was a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|witch or wizard]] who lived in the early [[21st century]]. After being informed of their magical heritage by [[Rubeus Hagrid]], they started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[2008]].<ref name="MA11"/>{{MATimeRef}}

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|1996/1997-2008}}===
This individual was born to a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] family between [[1996]] and [[1997]].{{MATimeRef}} During their childhood, their latent magical abilities often surfaced, which they believed was unusual, despite [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student's parents|their parents]] being amused and not taking it seriously.<ref name="MA11"/>

During the summer of [[2008]],{{MATimeRef}} [[Rubeus Hagrid]], the [[Keeper of Keys and Grounds]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], paid them a visit and delivered the [[Hogwarts acceptance letter]]. Being a [[Muggle-born]], they were escorted to [[Diagon Alley]] by Hagrid on his flying [[motorbike]] to purchase their school stuff. They first went to [[Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions]] to dress themselves up,<ref name="MA11"/> and then [[Ollivanders]] to purchase their wand.<ref name="MA12"/> Hagrid also invited them to the [[Eeylops Owl Emporium]] and gifted them an [[owl]]. When they were ready to return home, Hagrid's motorbike had trouble starting, so they used the [[London Underground]].<ref name="MA13">{{MA|1|3}}</ref>

When they arrived at [[King's Cross Station]] on [[1 September]], they were unsure how to find [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]]. Just then, [[Harry Potter]], whose identity was unknown to them, tapped them on the shoulder and instructed them to run straight into the wall between [[Platform Nine]] and [[Platform Ten|Ten]]. They successfully boarded the [[Hogwarts Express]] and arrived at [[Hogsmeade station]], after which they crossed the [[Great Lake]] on a [[Hogwarts boats|boat]] with other [[First year|first-year]]s and reached the [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="MA14">{{MA|1|4}}</ref>

===Hogwarts years {{C|2008–2015}}===
====First year====
=====Sorting Ceremony=====
[[Minerva McGonagall|Headmistress McGonagall]] led them into the [[Great Hall]] and delivered a speech, mentioning a grumpy [[ghoul]] having taken up residence in an empty classroom on the third floor, and assuring students that while they would hopefully never face such evil as in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], should challenges arise, the joint forces of them would be truly powerful. The [[Sorting Ceremony]] followed, during which they were sorted into a [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] they preferred. [[Ivy Warrington]] was at first not present at the ceremony, but she was later brought forward by Hagrid, who explained she had gotten distracted by bushes outside the castle, and was sorted into the same House. After the ceremony, they enjoyed the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] and got a good night's rest.<ref name="MA15"/>

=====First lessons=====
For their first lessons at Hogwarts, they studied the [[Levitation Charm]] in [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]'s [[Charms (class)|Charms class]] and brewing the [[Hair-Raising Potion]] in [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s [[Potions (class)|Potions class]]. Between the classes, they heard several students in a corridor talking about [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]'s defeat of a [[Troll]] using nothing but the Levitation Charm in his [[first year]]. When the students blocked [[Cassandra Vole]]'s way to Potions class, she brusquely told them to move.<ref name="MA16">{{MA|1|6}}</ref>

In Potions class, when [[rat tail]]s were missing, they managed to retrieve some from the [[Dungeons]], but encountered an [[Acromantula]], which they quickly defeated.<ref name="MA16"/>

=====Duelling Club=====
After classes, they witnessed several students practising advanced [[Transfiguration]] spells in their [[common room]], which inspired them to visit the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] to learn more spells. There, they saw [[Robyn Thistlethwaite]] attempting to cast ''[[Sectumsempra]]'' and ''[[Incarcerous Spell|Incarcerous]]'' on a copy of ''[[The Monster Book of Monsters]]'', but she didn't quite succeed and the book was angered. [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] came, picked up and calmed the book down, and suggested the [[First year|first-year]]s visit the [[Duelling Club (2000s)|Duelling Club]] to master the incantations.<ref name="MA17">{{MA|1|7}}</ref> There, they gave [[duelling]] a try, opposing [[Cassandra Vole]] and [[Fischer Frey]].<ref name="MA18">{{MA|1|8}}</ref>

=====Exploring the Forbidden Forest=====
[[Ivy Warrington|Ivy]] wanted to collect some [[potion]] ingredients for [[Daniel Page]] by looking for them in the [[Forbidden Forest]]. [[Kevin Farrell]] didn't feel safe but Ivy said the only things they should look for were some [[Jobberknoll feather]]s, [[Galanthus Nivalis|snowdrop]] and [[sage]]. They found some thyme right away, and they and Ivy decided to go further into the Forest to look for the other ingredients. During their adventure, they encountered some magical creatures and an individual [[Attack in the Forbidden Forest|battling]] a [[Norwegian Ridgeback]], which they also had to fight after the said individual [[Apparition|Disapparated]]. They found some snowdrop right where the dragon had been.<ref name="MA19">{{MA|1|9}}</ref>

=====Attending a ball=====
They met [[Robyn Thistlethwaite|Robyn]] and [[Kevin Farrell|Kevin]] at a school ball, who had been dancing together and encouraged them to also invite a partner to dance.<ref name="MA10">{{MA|1|10}}</ref>

=====Finding Ivy Warrington=====
At night, they and other two students met [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]], who had discovered that [[Ivy Warrington|Ivy]] went missing. On the [[Grand Staircase]], they met [[Robyn Thistlethwaite]] who was looking for Ivy as well and had already arranged a search party. The party consisted of Robyn, [[Daniel Page|Daniel]] and [[Kevin Farrell|Kevin]], who had met in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]]. Daniel was definite he wouldn't want to risk wandering around the castle in the middle of the night, but Kevin was convinced to do the search with them.<ref name="MA111">{{MA|1|11}}</ref>

The students arrived at the [[Potions Classroom]] and Robyn liberated several [[spider]]s, which took a while for them to [[Attack in the Potions Classroom|defeat]]. They went back to the revolving Grand Staircase and encountered [[Peeves]], who stirred up another [[Skirmish on the fifth floor|fight]]. Kevin got lost in the process, and Daniel came to call them back. Suddenly, they saw [[Argus Filch|Mr Filch]], and in a panic, they entered the [[Charms Classroom]] which had a "KEEP OUT" sign on the door. There, they encountered another copy of ''[[The Monster Book of Monsters]]'', and to make things worse, Robyn used the [[Engorgement Charm]] on it to get a better look. When the book was finally [[Attack in the Charms Classroom|struck down]], Robyn was nowhere to be seen either.<ref name="MA111"/>

They arrived at the [[seventh-floor corridor]] beside the [[Troll Tapestry]], and when they thought about the situation and paced back and forth, they accidentally triggered the door to the [[Room of Requirement]]. Ivy was found in the room and told her story of feeling being followed and looking for a place to hide, and judging by how Ivy seemed to be oblivious to the details, they thought she might have been [[curse]]d. Before leaving, they discovered a trunk with the word "WW", and when it was left alone, a white hand reached out from it.<ref name="MA111"/>

=====Rescuing Gossamer=====
In the [[common room]], [[Ivy Warrington|Ivy]] showed [[Daniel Page|Daniel]] how to properly cast the [[Levitation Charm]], and they also tried the [[Hardening Charm]] and the [[Disarming Charm]]. When Daniel went to retrieve his [[wand]], he saw an object inside a secret hole in a wall, which turned out to contain a [[portrait]] of a small [[knight]]. [[Lottie Turner|Lottie]] realised it wasn't moving, and a voice emanated from it saying "help me". They used the [[Revealing Charm]] and revealed chains trapping the knight. Just then, [[Peeves]] showed up and tried to destroy the portrait, but was [[Skirmish in the common room|defeated]] by them. The chains were broken, allowing the knight to travel among other portraits. He introduced himself as [[Gossamer]], who was [[curse]]d and hidden away for years, and he was delighted to become the students' "loyal friend and dutiful guide" by moving through other portraits to update and alert them. He then went off to visit his old friends.<ref name="MA112">{{MA|1|12}}</ref>

The portrait around the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]] became upset because of Gossamer's mischievous activities. An [[angry wizard]]'s portrait recalled how the portraits had decided to remove Gossamer from the general population, and that a student had done the lock on his portrait. In order to repair the man's portrait frame, Daniel decided to unlock [[Argus Filch|Filch]]'s [[Argus Filch's tool chest|tool chest]], but released some rats instead. They quickly [[Attack beside the angry wizard's portrait|took them down]], and helped repair the portrait. Daniel and Ivy had a difference of opinion on the treatment that Gossamer had received, and they agreed with Ivy, but were worried that Gossamer would be locked up again if he caused more trouble.<ref name="MA112"/>

They and their friends found Gossamer, who said a witch or wizard he had been talking to went missing and suggested them organise a search party. They and Daniel didn't think it was necessary because the said witch or wizard had probably intended to get away from him, which left Gossamer heart-broken. They were soon discovered by Filch, whose contraption malfunctioned and released a [[trio of Red Caps]], who were [[Attack beside Gossamer's portrait|defeated]] by them. Gossamer was moved and acknowledge they were his friends. When he suggested himself being put in a more secluded place, they placed him in their common room.<ref name="MA112"/>
<!-- THE FOLLOWING MAY NO LONGER BE CORRECT IN THE OFFICIAL RELEASE
[[Sybill Trelawney|Professor Trelawney]] invited them to the [[Divination Classroom]], where they discovered a vibrating teakettle. Turned out the teakettle had an [[Occamy]] in it, and when Trelawney came, she asked them to deliver it to [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]].<ref name="MA"/>

=====Hanging out with friends=====
Later in [[Charms (class)|Charms class]], [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] let them, Ivy and [[Cassandra Vole|Cassandra]] practise the [[Incarcerous Spell]] together, but when Ivy tried it, Cassandra muttered a [[counter-spell]] that nullified Ivy's spell, which caused Ivy to use the spell on her in retaliation. Flitwick deducted five [[house points]] for Ivy's behaviour, which Ivy thought for sure she could win back by participating in club activities.<ref name="MA"/>

In [[Hagrid's Hut]], they and [[Daniel Page|Daniel]] met [[Robyn Thistlethwaite|Robyn]]'s [[egg]] which Robyn claimed to be from an [[Egypt]]ian [[dragon]]. She decided to put it in hot [[water]] to let it hatch, so they provided the [[fire]] to warm the water up. After a while, they sensed something was wrong with the egg, and Daniel thought he smelled boiled egg. Hagrid arrived and informed them it was only an [[ostrich egg]]. He remembered raising [[Norberta]] and showed them a memory of it, which played on top of a [[cauldron]] after Hagrid poured in a vial of [[memory]].<ref name="MA"/>

When they went to [[Potions (class)|Potions class]], they surprisingly found two Daniels, and asked a question to identify the real Daniel. Then the other one revealed herself to be Ivy, and explained that she and Daniel had a bet over whether they would still recognise the real Daniel after she transformed, and if they didn't, Daniel would have to teach her how to brew the [[Hair-Raising Potion]]. It's unknown whether they really recognised him or not, but Daniel decided to teach the both of them anyway.<ref name="MA"/>

=====The Book with No Name=====
[[Kevin Farrell|Kevin]] met them and [[Robyn Thistlethwaite|Robyn]] in the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]] and told them about a [[Book with No Name|book]], which he'd thought had been an ordinary [[History of Magic]] book, but it'd seemed to be blank but alive and sucked him in, where he'd seen a [[three-headed dog]] and blacked out. When they went to retrieve the book, it leapt and showed itself to be blank. Kevin then recalled the three-headed dog [[Fluffy]] in the [[third-floor corridor]], which was exactly where he had blacked out. In the book, they assumed the identity of [[Harry Potter]] and relived his moments in the room with Fluffy and the [[Chessboard Chamber]].<ref name="MA"/>

=====First examination=====
When [[Daniel Page|Daniel]] finished his test and came out of the examination hall, he gave [[Robyn Thistlethwaite|Robyn]] a vial of [[Pumpkin Juice]], but Robyn thought it was [[Felix Felicis]], and she felt very confident and aced her test. Then they went in to finish their test.<ref name="MA"/>

In the [[Great Hall]], the four [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] [[ghost]]s were gathering and having a conversation. When they came forward, they heard the ghosts talking about the winners of the [[House Cup]]. [[Minerva McGonagall|Headmistress McGonagall]] then stepped forward and introduced the House Cup and the system of [[House points]]. Robyn was excited about the House Cup and expected to win House points in [[Quidditch]] matches, which was met with ridicule from [[Cassandra Vole|Cassandra]]. Nevertheless, when [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas]] asked, she said she wanted to become a [[Chaser]]. They also conferred ideas about the House Cup with Daniel, [[Ivy Warrington|Ivy]] and [[Lottie Turner|Lottie]].<ref name="MA"/>

Later, they met [[Tom Stevens]] outside a bathroom with [[Peeves]] inside releasing water and singing. After making some efforts searching in the water-filled bathroom, they found Peeves and informed him that the [[Bloody Baron]] was on his way, which scared Peeves away. They also had a [[Flying (class)|Flying class]] with [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]], during which they were asked to fly through as many hoops drawn by her as possible.<ref name="MA"/>

When they saw [[Fang]] outside of [[Hagrid's Hut]], he seemed to be in low spirits, and collapsed after showed them some teeth. They noticed some pink feathers in the [[pumpkin]] patch before some [[Fwooper]]s flew out, which they quickly brought under control, realising that they were the reason Fang was went frenzied. [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] thanked them and admitted he hadn't got around to renew the [[Silencing Charm]] on them yet.<ref name="MA"/>

=====Breakfast confrontation=====
One morning, they were having breakfast with their friends when [[Robyn Thistlethwaite|Robyn]] mentioned [[Gossamer]] would show her a secret passage to the [[Hogwarts kitchens|kitchens]]. [[Kevin Farrell|Kevin]] received his first copy of the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', which was rudely [[Summoning Charm|summoned]] by [[Fisher Frey]]. They then fought the twins, who claimed afterwards that they've made not only one, but two enemies. Kevin read from the newspaper that the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] had had to [[Memory Charm|Obliviate]] over four hundred [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] after the statues in [[Trafalgar Square]] had hopped off their pedestals and danced a jig, which had probably been the act of [[Nocturnal Order of Tricks and Magical Exhibitions|NOTME]]. When Robyn and Kevin left, they and Daniel further discussed the organisation's intention of making [[magic]] known to everybody, before [[Cassandra Vole|Cassandra]] came in and made fun of him, but was then confronted by [[Ivy Warrington|Ivy]]. When Daniel joined the face-off, he was threatened by Cassandra to be locked up in [[Azkaban]], and then Cassandra left, throwing Ivy another snide remark. Soon, they and Daniel realised Ivy was gone too.<ref name="MA"/>

When they caught up with her, she cast a [[Vanishing Spell]] and Vanished a [[suit of armour]]. They asked her whether she intended to aim at Cassandra with the spell, but she had no idea how she could do it and couldn't remember where she had learned it. Then [[Neville Longbottom|Professor Longbottom]] walked in and gave the three of them (except Cassandra) detention, during which they had to polish every [[suit of armour]] without using magic. After Longbottom left, the armours suddenly moved and attacked them. It turned out to be [[Peeves]] who had controlled them.<ref name="MA"/>

Later before [[Quidditch]] practice, Robyn's [[broomstick]] went missing. They went with Robyn to the [[Great Hall]] and tried to use the [[Summoning Charm]] on Cassandra, the [[Colby and Fisher Frey|Frey twins]], and even below the tables, but didn't receive the broom. Kevin then came in with her broom and explained to her that he was pruning it with his broomcare tools.<ref name="MA"/>

They, Daniel, Ivy and [[Lottie Turner|Lottie]] helped [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] get rid of the [[Flesh-Eating Slug]]s in his [[pumpkin]] patch using the [[Freezing Spell]]. They heard that Robyn had been injured during Quidditch practice on a stormy day, so they paid her a visit. In the [[Hospital Wing]], Robyn retold seeing a pair of giant wings hidden behind the clouds before she was knocked out. In order to investigate, they went to the [[Hogwarts Quidditch pitch|Quidditch pitch]] and talked to Hagrid, who thought it might have been a [[Thunderbird]], but unlikely due to Thunderbirds being mostly in [[North America]]. A Thunderbird then showed up, allowing Hagrid to capture it.<ref name="MA"/>-->
