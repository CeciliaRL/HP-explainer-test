The '''bogle-banshee''' was allegedly a [[Banshee]], a [[Dark Arts|dark]] [[spirit]] which dwelt in the city of [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]]. On the "[[Defence Against the Dark Arts Second Year Essential Knowledge Test|Second Year Essential Knowledge Test]]" that [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] gave to his [[second year|second-year]] [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class in [[1992]], there was a question that asked "What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?", to which one student answered "to banish the bogle-banshee in Katmandu [sic]."<ref name="HPPS">{{HPPS}}, p. 74 {{see image|File:LockhartTest1.jpg}}</ref> The defeat of this creature was possibly covered in ''[[Break with a Banshee]]''.
