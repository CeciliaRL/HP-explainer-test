==Biography==
During her time as an [[Auror]], [[Porpentina Goldstein]] used Gnarlak as an informant and was familiar with his establishment, [[The Blind Pig]], and the business which occurred therein.<ref name="FBS">{{FB|S}}</ref>

Gnarlak carried two [[wand]]s, although his skill in wand-based [[magic]] is not known. It is also unknown how he gained ownership of such wands.<ref>{{FB|S}} - Gnarlak's possession of wands may be a result of him being a gangster and operating outside the law, or the laws restricting wand ownership may be different in America than in England.</ref>

While looking for [[Newton Scamander]]'s missing animals, Tina suggested that Gnarlak could be useful in their hunt. Tina, Newt, [[Jacob Kowalski]] and [[Queenie Goldstein]] met with Gnarlak, whereupon they attempted to bargain for information. Gnarlak indicated that he wasn't interested in gold or trinkets, but when Newt offered an [[ashwinder egg]], his interest was piqued.<ref name="FBS" />

However, Gnarlak then spotted [[Pickett]], one of Newt's [[Bowtruckle]]s, and was greatly interested, as they were reportedly able to [[Lock picking|pick locks]]. Newt reluctantly accepted this exchange.<ref>[https://youtu.be/3VgbPNSmpUk Youtube - CBS Sunday Morning interview of Eddie Redmayne]</ref> However, Gnarlak had already informed [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] of Newt's location in an attempt to reap the bounty on his head. MACUSA agents entered the Pig and began arresting everyone in sight.<ref name="FBS" />

As Gnarlak laughed with perceived victory, Jacob [[Muggle duelling|punched]] him in the face, noting that Gnarlak reminded him of his [[Jacob Kowlaski's foreman|foreman]]. As Gnarlak lay unconscious on the floor, Newt retrieved Pickett and [[Apparition|apparated]] away with Jacob, Tina and Queenie, leaving Gnarlak to face the [[Auror]]s upon regaining consciousness. They have possibly arrested him for allowing "criminals" into his establishment, along with his general illegal dealings.<ref name="FBS" />

==Personality and traits==
Gnarlak was a highly cunning, duplicitous and unpleasant Goblin, having engaged in many criminal dealings throughout his life as an black market gangster, showing no respect for American wizarding law. He was incredibly avaricious and money-minded, with his sole interest being earning a profit and gaining valuable assets, no matter what the cost. He was also very ruthless in achieving his aims, often being malicious to others, even to those who he dealt with, as when he slyly reported both [[Newton Scamander]] and [[Porpentina Goldstein]] to [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]], even laughing spitefully afterwards, showing he clearly distrusted and disliked [[Wizardkind]] in general, like many of his species.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Goblin magic]]''': Being a Goblin with his own kind of magic, Gnarlak was capable of performing [[wandless magic]], being able to conjure a [[magic]]al protective barrier around himself and [[Levitation|levitate]] objects around him.<ref name="LEGOD">{{LEGO|D}} (see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThtP3Ix5Kvg this video])</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Gnarlack LEGO D.jpg|thumb|right|Gnarlak as he appears in {{LEGO|D}}]]
*Gnarlak is portrayed by [[Ron Perlman]] in {{FB|FA}}.<ref name="Pottermore" />
*{{JKRS}}, after the [[20 December]] [[2016]] redesign, featured an image of a page from an early draft of {{FB|S}} with a deleted scene in which Gnarlak mentions that he was from "the old country", [[Great Britain]], like Newton Scamander, and that his whole family is with [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] in the "treasure-and-curse" business.<ref>{{JKRS}} - {{see image|File:Script - jkrowling website.png}}</ref>
*Although never mentioned, Gnarlak’s fingers are severely malformed, bending almost completely backwards at the second knuckle. Despite this he seems to have no difficulty using his hands.
