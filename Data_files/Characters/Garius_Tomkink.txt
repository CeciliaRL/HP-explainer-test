'''Professor Garius Tomkink''' was a [[magic]]al historian and author.<ref name="galeria">[http://galeria.potterish.com/thumbnails.php?album=4483 The cover of ''Hogwarts, a History''] (scan from ''Harry Potter Page to Screen'')</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube)|console versions of the ''Chamber of Secrets'' video game]], [[Chroniculus Punnet]] stated to be the author of ''[[Hogwarts: A History|Hogwarts, A History]]''. However, a later film prop identifies the book's author as Professor Garius Tomkink.<ref name="galeria" /> Neither can be considered canon, however, as both the books and {{WWHP}} state that [[Bathilda Bagshot]] wrote it.
