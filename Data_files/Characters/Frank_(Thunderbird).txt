'''Frank''' was the name [[Magizoologist]] [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] gave to a [[Thunderbird]] he rescued from traffickers in [[Egypt]] in the [[1920s]].<ref name="EW2016-08-12">[http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-creature-gallery/2707938_thunderbird "'Fantastic Beasts': Meet the Creatures"] at [http://www.ew.com/ Entertainment Weekly]</ref> Newt described him as a majestic, powerful, and regal creature, but a "wee-bit sensitive to strangers".<ref>{{FB|G}} - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhSbzjdCDBA Google Daydream VR: Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them Gameplay / Hands-On]</ref>

==Biography==
Around [[1926]], [[Albus Dumbledore]] informed Newt of illegal traffickers in [[Egypt]] that had a captured [[Thunderbird]] in their possession. The young [[Magizoologist]] travelled to Egypt and rescued the bird, naming him Frank and promising to return him to his native habitat in [[Arizona]]. Though one of Frank's legs bore the wounds of being chained, his gratitude to Newt was "evident"<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/Inside-Magic-Making-Fantastic-Beasts/dp/0008204594| Inside the Magic: The Making of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them] - direct quote: "After rescuing a Thunderbird from traffickers in Egypt, Newt named him Frank and promised to return him to his natural habitat in Arizona. Sadly, one of Frank’s legs bears the wounds of having been chained, but his gratitude to Newt for having rescued him is evident." in the Thunderbird section.</ref> 

In [[1926]], Scamander travelled the [[United States of America]], using a [[Non-magic people|muggle]] passenger ship. He hoped to avoid the attention of the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]], due to their laws regarding private possession of [[Magical Creatures]] at that time. After a journey he landed in [[New York|New York City]].  

Around that time, there were a large number of magical incidents in the city. Some were indirectly caused by Scamander and the creatures that escaped his [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|suitcase]], but others were caused by the young [[Obscurial]], [[Credence Barebone]], and the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Gellert Grindelwald]], who hoped to use Barebone's destructive powers for his own purposes. These incident culminated in the [[Obscurial attack on New York]].

After the battle, Newt gave Frank a vial of [[Swooping Evil]] venom, taking advantage of the Thunderbird's weather related powers to spread the venom through a rainstorm. Exposure to the diffused venom had the effect of wiping negative memories and so wiped [[New York]]'s [[No-Maj]] population of their memories of the devastation.

Frank managed to return to Arizona after being released, presumably flying under his own power.<ref name="twitter1">[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/800648162771894272 21 November 2016 tweet by J. K. Rowling (@jk_rowling)]</ref>

Newt later came to believe that Dumbledore had given him the tip about Frank to deliberately arrange for Newt to go to New York to oppose Grindlewald's activities there.<ref name= "CoG">{{COG|S}} </ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*At the end of {{FB|FA}}, Frank is seen leaving [[New York]] flying towards the sun. As the sun was coming up at the time, this means Frank was flying eastwards, which is the wrong way to get to [[Arizona]]. However, he could have made a U-turn, or he could have just been heading towards the nearest clouds.
