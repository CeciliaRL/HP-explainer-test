'''Megan Scott''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] that lived in [[Yorkshire]].

==Biography==
She was found unconscious in a [[Yorkshire]] graveyard by [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|her partner]] after she was attacked.<ref name="FBC9-1">{{FBC|9|1}}</ref> [[Healer]] [[Omar Abasi]] was able to mend her wounds and she explained that [[Catherine Tyler|her grandmother]], who was recently deceased, had given her a map of the area and told to 'seek her past' and that '[[Horatio Cloke|Cloke]] knows the truth'.<ref name="FBC9-1"/>

[[Jacturus Cloke III]] later attacked her and cast the [[Incarcerous Spell]], tying her up. However, Cloke was then driven off by a protective [[Unicorn]]. <ref name="FBC9-3">{{FBC|9|3}}</ref> It was later revealed that he had been hunting the unicorn, attempting to gather valuable [[Unicorn hair|hair]], [[Unicorn horn|horn]], and [[Unicorn blood|blood]] from it to restore his family's lost fortune.<ref name="FBC9-4" />

Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner were able to set her free, but because of everything she had seen, they ultimately had to [[Memory Charm|Obliviate]] her. They gave her a chest full of gold and jewels that [[Horatio Cloke]] had stashed away when planning to elope with her grandmother, hence her cryptic statement.<ref name="FBC9-4">{{FBC|9|4}}</ref>
