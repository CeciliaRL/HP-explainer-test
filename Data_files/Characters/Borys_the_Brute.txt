}}'''Borys the Brute''' was a  [[hypnosis|hypnotist]] in the [[1920s]].

==Biography==
He was part of the [[Circus Arcanus]], a travelling freak show, which billed him as "perfidious" and warned people to "take heed of his artful deception."<ref name="poster">[http://store.minalima.com/shop/fantastic-beasts/limited-edition-prints/no-maj-street-posters/circus-arcanus-museum-of-human-oddities-poster/ MinaLima Store - Circus Arcanus - Museum of Human Oddities Poster] {{see image|File:Circus Arcanus.png}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Considering that the Circus Arcanus was magical, it seems likely that Borys could perform a [[magic]]al form of [[hypnosis]], possibly similar to that of [[Wampus cat]]s.
