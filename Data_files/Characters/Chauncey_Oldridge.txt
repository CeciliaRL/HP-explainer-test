'''Chauncey Oldridge''' ([[1342]] – [[1379]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the first known victim of [[Dragon Pox]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref> Oldridge was born in [[1342]], eventually contracting [[Dragon Pox]] at some point in his life. As a result, his skin turned green and became covered with blemishes. While others before him have contracted Dragon Pox,<ref name="QTAR">{{QTA|R}} -- [[Gunhilda Kneen]] was known to have Dragon Pox about a century earlier than Oldridge, flourishing in the [[13th century]]</ref> he was the first to succumb to it in [[1379]], with no [[Dragon pox cure|cure]] yet available. Becoming famous for being the first person to fall victim to [[Dragon pox]], Chauncey Oldridge became immortalised on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="PSG" /><ref name="COSG"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Chauncey" comes from a Norman surname of unknown meaning. It was used as a given name in American in honour of Harvard president Charles Chauncey (1592-1672).

==Behind the scenes==
*Before the publication of {{QTA|R}}, it appeared that Oldridge was the first person ever to contract [[Dragon Pox]] in history. However, the book clarifies it was already known to [[Wizardkind]] at least a century before Oldridge, so in this case, the word "victim" is assumed to mean he was the first person to have died from it.
