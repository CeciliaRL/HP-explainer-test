{{Quote|The ''Harry Potter'' covers by Mary GrandPré are so fantastic and iconic. When I was asked to submit samples, I initially hesitated because I didn't want to see them reinterpreted! However, I felt that if I were to handle the project, I could bring something to it that many other designers and illustrators probably couldn't, and that was that I was also a writer of my own series of middle grade fiction. As an author myself, I tried to answer the question, ‘If I were the author of the books - and they were like my own children - how would I want them to be seen years from now?' When illustrating the covers, I tried to think of classic perennial paperback editions of famous novels and how those illustrations tend to feel. In a way, the project became a tribute to both ''Harry Potter'' and the literary classics.|Kazu Kibuishi on being asked to illustrate the ''Harry Potter'' series<ref>[http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/scholastic-unveils-first-seven-new-covers-harry-potter-books-celebration-15th-annivers Scholastic Unveils First of Seven New Covers for the Harry Potter Books in Celebration of the 15th Anniversary of Harry Potter - Scholastic.com]</ref>|}}
