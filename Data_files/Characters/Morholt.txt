'''Morholt''' was a [[Giant]] from [[Ireland]]. He was the brother of the [[Morholt's brother|King of Ireland]]. He wounded the Celtic hero, [[Tristan]] with a [[poison]]ed sword after Tristan tried to kill him.<ref>{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Morholt was based on the [[Wikipedia:Morholt|figure in Celtic legend of the same name]].
*Although Morholt's brother was the King of Ireland, Morholt would not have been a prince nor royalty as the High King was elected, as opposed to inheriting the position from a family member.
