}}This '''[[giant]]''' was a member of the [[Giant colony]] who fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], fighting for [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]. It is unknown if he survived the battle, but he possibly died.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This giant is played by [[Matthew Bancroft]] in the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|film adaptation]] of {{DH}}, but he was not credited along with the other giants so only three of them are credited.
*Bancroft's giant, unlike I, II and III, did not appear in the video game.
*In {{LEGO|Y2}} this giant stands on the top of an area in a courtyard. He has to be shot with a catapult three times before he falls backwards into the [[Ravine]] below.<ref name="LEGOY2">{{LEGO|Y2}}</ref>
