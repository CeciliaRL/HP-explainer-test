In [[1993]], Professor Fronsac had several portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]]; quite a few of them at the [[Grand Staircase]].<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

By [[1995]], his portrait was hung at the [[Grand Staircase]]. The portrait guarded a shortcut leading to the second-floor corridor, near the [[Hogwarts Library|Library]]. He held a [[Basil Fronsac's pocket watch|pocket watch]] and his password was "''Studious Success''". He would be happy to help any "inquisitive minds" that could find out where [[Rowena Ravenclaw]] came from.<ref name="OPg" />

In the next school year, the portrait was moved to the [[Dungeons]]. He still guarded a secret passage, this time leading to the [[Grand Staircase]]. His password became "''Libraries Liberate''".<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Basil" is from the Greek name "Βασιλειος" ("''Vasileios''"), which was derived from "βασιλευς" ("''Basileus''"), meaning "king". Saint Basil the Great was a 4th-century bishop of Caesarea and one of the fathers of the early Christian church. It was also borne by two Byzantine emperors.

"Fronsac" is a French surname denoting a person who came from the town of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fronsac,_Gironde Fronsac], which dates back to Gaulish times. In modern times, it is most notable for its [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fronsac_AOC namesake wine].

==Behind the scenes==
*The portrait of the middle-aged Basil Fronsac appears to be a homage to a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ed/Henry_James_by_John_Singer_Sargent_cleaned.jpg portrait of Henry James] by John Singer Sargent, which was painted in 1913.<ref>https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw03436/Henry-James</ref> This might suggest that Fronsac served as the Hogwarts [[headmaster]] in the early [[20th century|twentieth century]] or late [[19th century|nineteenth century]].
