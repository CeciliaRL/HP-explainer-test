'''Rufus Fudge''' was the nephew of former [[Minister for Magic]] [[Cornelius Fudge]]. He joined the [[Improper Use of Magic Office]] in [[February]] of [[1999]], but made a [[London Underground|tube train]] [[Vanishing Spell|vanish]] for a bet and was suspended for his actions.<ref name="DP">[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[8 February]], [[1999]], Page 1</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Rufus" is a Roman cognomen which meant "red-haired" in Latin. Several early saints had this name, including one mentioned in one of Paul's epistles in the New Testament. As a nickname it was used by William II Rufus, a king of England, because of his red hair. It came into general use in the English-speaking world after the Protestant Reformation.

==Behind the scenes==
*His two names were names of Ministers for Magic,﻿ [[Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus]] and [[Cornelius Fudge|Fudge]], the former being his uncle's successors.
