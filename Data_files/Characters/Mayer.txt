==Behind the scenes==
*The text of the article mentioning Mayer in the [[:File:New York Chronicle - Monday Dec 1926 (HQ).png|prop issue]] of the ''[[New York Chronicle]]'' featured in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' was taken from the real [[21 November]] [[1922]] issue of ''[[wikipedia:The Evening World|The Evening World]]''.<ref name="eveningworld" /> This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in [[1926]], but the actual events referenced occurred in 1922.
