{{Quote|It was a Goblin philosopher who said: 'Money is the root of all happiness'.|[[Gringotts Wizarding Bank|Gringotts]] goblin bank teller.|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)}}
A '''goblin philosopher''' once noted on the importance of [[wizarding currency|money]], considering it the source of all happiness.<ref>{{COS|G}} - GBC version</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This quote is a variant of [[Bible|1 Timothy 6:10]], which states: "For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows." The change of "evil" to "happiness" reflects goblin ideals over [[human]] ones.
