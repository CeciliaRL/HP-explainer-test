'''Professor Fortinbras''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Charms (class)|Charms]] [[professor]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] at some point between the [[15th century|15th]] and [[19th century|19th]] centuries.<ref name="Y3SQ"/>

==Biography==
Fortinbras was a former [[Charms Master]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], who taught sometime vaguely between the [[15th century]] and [[19th century]]. [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] knew her, and she sometimes talked about the [[Cursed Vaults]] while he was listening. Sir Nicholas told [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Angelica Cole]] about her in [[1987]]. At some point in her teaching career, she came to believe (correctly) that the fabled [[Cursed Vaults]] were real and wrote her fears and suspicions about them in a [[Folio of Fortinbras|folio]] that she left behind in [[Charms Classroom|her old classroom]]. At the time, teachers and students alike formed a 'circle of trust' that worked together in researching the vaults, with the [[Potions Master]] of the day, Professor [[Bartholomew]], being her closest confidant. Her loyalty to him was such that she even sought to conceal his identity so that her colleague would not be implicated in the conspiracy.<ref name="Y3SQ">{{HM|3|Nearly Headless Nick}}</ref>
