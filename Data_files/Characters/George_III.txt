'''George III''' (full name '''George William Frederick'''; [[4 June]], [[1738]] – [[29 January]], [[1820]]), was [[King]] of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] from [[25 October]], [[1760]] to [[29 January]], [[1820]].<ref name="wikipedia">"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom George III of the United Kingdom]" on Wikipedia</ref>

He ruled the [[Great Britain|United Kingdom]] during the [[Revolutionary War]], a notable military conflict between the non-magical peoples of Britain and (what would eventually become) the [[United States of America|United States]]; neither wizarding government ([[British Ministry of Magic]], led by [[Maximilian Crowdy|Minister Crowdy]], or the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]], led by [[Elizabeth McGilliguddy|President McGilliguddy]]) officially intervened.

King George suffered from [[Insanity|mental illness]] in his later years.<ref name="wikipedia" /><ref name="pm-ministers">{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref> In [[1782]], the [[Prime Minister]] at the time, [[Lord North]], confidentially reached out to then-[[Minister for Magic]] [[Porteus Knatchbull]] to see if he could help with the king's condition.<ref name="pm-ministers" /> However, this resulted in a rumour spreading that Lord North believed in [[wizardkind|wizards]], triggering a motion of no confidence that forced his resignation.<ref name="pm-ministers" />
