==Biography==
{{Quote|I've only ever played Seeker. Am I unbalanced?|This girl to [[Orion Amari]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
During her time at Hogwarts, she was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into the same house as [[Jacob's sibling]]. At some point by the [[1985–1986 school year]], she became the [[Seeker]] of her house's Quidditch team.<ref name="HM">{{HM}}</ref>

She planned to ask her mom and dad for a [[Comet 260]] for [[Christmas]].<ref name="Comet">{{HM|2|Q1|9}}</ref>

She continued playing on the team the following two years.<ref>{{HM|3|Q2|1}}</ref><ref>{{HM|4|Q3|1}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Her house is the same as that of [[Jacob's sibling]], which is chosen by the player.
*Her existence causes a contradiction for [[Gryffindor]] players, as it is established that [[Charles Weasley]] was the Seeker of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] starting in the [[1985–1986 school year]].
*She was also afraid of [[Gnome]]s.<ref>{{HM|2|Q1|12}}</ref>
*She apparently was not skilled at [[Divination (class)|Divination]].<ref>{{HM|3|Q2|10}}</ref>
