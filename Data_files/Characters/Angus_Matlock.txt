'''Angus Matlock''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]]. He was the captain of the Gryffindor [[Duelling Club (1990s)|Duelling Club]] by [[1996]].<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Biography==
Angus Matlock was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] when he arrived at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was in at least his [[third year]] of education by the [[1996-1997 school year]], referring on occasion to [[First year|first]] and [[second year]]s as younger students. Angus became captain for [[Gryffindor]] when the [[Duelling Club]] was revived by [[Albus Dumbledore]]. Angus convinced [[Harry Potter]] to join the duelling club, and requested that he and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] show a group of watching [[first year]]s how to cast the [[Stunning Spell]] and [[Disarming Charm]], along with how to dodge [[spell]]s.<ref name="HBPG"/>

Angus had a rather controlling and loud personality, shouting at first years for not paying attention and demanding Ron and Harry duel; however he also was rather impressed by Harry Potter for being able to fight [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. Ron Weasley did not seem too happy to find out that Angus was the leader of the duelling club for Gryffindor when he and Harry first arrived.<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Duelling]]''': As the head of the [[Gryffindor]] [[Duelling Club (1990s)|Duelling Club]], Angus was a very proficient duellist, who was skilled with both the [[Stunning Spell]] and the [[Disarming Charm]], as well with the dodging of [[spell]]s in combat.<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Angus Matlock has only ever appeared in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|video game adaptation]] of ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]]'', never in any of the [[Harry Potter (book series)|novels]].
*Angus is like other [[Wizardkind|students]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] as [[Bem]], [[Kellah]], [[Michael]] and [[Nigel Wolpert|Nigel]], purely made up for film/video game adaptations of the books.

==Etymology==
The name "Angus" possibly meaning "one strength" derived from Irish óen "one" and gus "force, strength, energy". Aonghus (sometimes surnamed Mac Og meaning "young son") was the Irish god of love and youth. The name was also borne by an 8th-century Pictish king and several Irish kings.
