'''Adalbert Waffling''' (d. [[1981]])<ref name="PSG"/> was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was a [[magic]]al theoretician, credited to have written "all about magic". Waffling is somewhat seen as the "father of magical theory", as it is a popular claim that every modern witch or wizard has learned from his writings.

Waffling was the one who formulated the [[Fundamental Laws of Magic]]<ref name="TBBR">{{TBB|H}}</ref> and wrote ''[[Magical Theory (book)|Magical Theory]]'', a most popular textbook still being used today by the young witches and wizards at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Adalbert Waffling was born in or before the 19th-century. By the [[1890s]], he was already a most notable theoretician.<ref name="DH2">{{DH|B|2}}</ref> Waffling might have attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth, like so many other wizards before him.

===Later life===
[[File:Adalbert Waffling USA Card.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Waffling studying [[magic]]]]
By the [[1890s]], Waffling was already one of most notable wizards of the date,<ref name="DH2" /><ref name="PM">[https://www.pottermore.com/features/things-we-bet-the-hogwarts-portraits-do-when-noone-is-watching| Pottermore - things we bet the Hogwarts portraits do when no-one is looking] - ''Imagine you’re a long-suffering wizarding portrait of someone famous, like Adalbert Waffling''.</ref> so it is more than likely he published some of his writings before this point. Around this time [[Albus Dumbledore]], the "''most brilliant student ever seen [at Hogwarts]''", was in regular correspondence with Waffling in order to exchange ideas about magic.<ref name="DH2" /> [[Minerva McGonagall]] later shared these letters with members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] who pursued a [[Professor]]ship profession to help improve their skills in addressing the [[Calamity]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}} ([https://youtu.be/Mc5_6YJXVvQ?t=300 see video])</ref>

Waffling died in [[1981]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In early editions of {{POA}}, ''[[A History of Magic]]'' is incorrectly said to be written by Adalbert Waffling, instead of [[Bathilda Bagshot]].
*In {{DH}}, it is revealed that [[Albus Dumbledore]] corresponded with Waffling during his time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. However, the dates given for Waffling's birth on his [[Chocolate Frog Card]] say that he was born after Dumbledore graduated (in [[1899]]).
*Adalbert Waffling's death date coincides with the height of the [[First Wizarding War]] and the original [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|downfall of Lord Voldemort]]. It is unknown if he died as a result of the war, or died of another reason.

==Etymology==
''Adal'' is Old High German for "''noble''" or "''aristocratic''"; ''berta'', "''bright''". "Waffling" means speaking or writing at length in a vague or trivial manner without a clear point or aim.
