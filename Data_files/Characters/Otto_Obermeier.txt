Minister '''Otto Obermeier''' was, as [[Minister for Magic]], the head of the [[Liechtenstein Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="PM9June">{{PM}} - [[RETURN OF HANS THE AUGUREY]] (Archived)</ref>

==Biography==
Following the [[American National Quidditch team|American]] victory over Liechtenstein on the quarter-finals of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]], the Liechtenstein mascot, a large and gloomy [[Augurey]] called [[Hans]], was kidnapped by high-spirited American fans celebrating their team's historic triumph.<ref name="PM8June">[http://www.pottermore.com/en/daily-prophet/qwc2014/2014-06-08/late-breaking-news New from J.K. Rowling - Daily Prophet: 8 June 2014 (II)]</ref> Hans was put back in his customised pen the following day, [[9 June]] [[2014]], but not before negotiations for his return reached the highest levels: Minister Otto Obermeier and President of the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]] [[Samuel G. Quahog]] had to exchange terse owls so that the bird was returned home. Even though President Quahog termed it was done in a "''friendly and cooperative fashion''", Minister Obermeier insisted that if any ill effects were discovered on [[Hans]], Liechtenstein would "''of course lobby the [[International Confederation of Wizards' Quidditch Committee|ICWQC]] for the USA's immediate disqualification from the World Cup''".<ref name="PM9June"/>
