'''Urgruff the Unwary''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Goblin]], who was deemed to be one of the finest [[Goblin-made ironwork|smiths]] in Goblin history.<ref name="HM6"/>

==Biography==
Urgruff boasted that he could make a perfect replica of a [[Dragon egg]] in solid [[gold]]. True to his word, he was indeed able to accomplish this feat, only for it to be stolen by [[Hungarian Horntail at the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary|a mother Dragon]] that mistook it for one of her own, torched his workshop and retrieved the priced treasure from the ashes of the smithy.<ref name="HM6"/>

At some point during the [[1989–1990 school year]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] received intelligence suggesting this dragon had been captured and confined to a famous [[Romanian Dragon Sanctuary|Dragon Sanctuary]] in [[Romania]], and tasked one of their [[Curse-Breakers]], [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]], with retrieving it, having even obtained a [[portkey]] to send him on his way.<ref name="HM6"/>
