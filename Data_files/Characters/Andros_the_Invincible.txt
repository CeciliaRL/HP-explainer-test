{{Quote|Andros the Invincible (Ancient Greek, dates unknown): Alleged to have been the only known wizard to produce a Patronus the size of a giant.|[[Chocolate Frog Card]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
'''Andros the Invincible''' was a celebrated Ancient [[Greece|Greek]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who, reportedly, was able to conjure a [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] as big as a giant — the only Patronus of such size ever recorded.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Lifetime===
Andros was born in [[Greece]], in the [[Wikipedia:Classical antiquity|Classical antiquity]]. At some point, he mastered [[Wandless magic|wandless spellcasting]] as well as the [[Patronus Charm]]. His corporeal Patronus was claimed to be the size of a [[Giant]], although whether its form was in fact a Giant or some other gigantic form is unclear. In recognition of his skill in wizardry, he earned the epithet 'the Invincible'.<ref name="COSG"/>

===Post-mortem===
[[File:Andros.JPG|thumb|right|140px|Andros immortalised on a silver [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]
By the [[1990s]], Andros was featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]], which recorded his wizarding skills and depicted him conjuring his famous Patronus [[Wandless magic|wandlessly]].<ref name="COSG" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Andros was evidently very accomplished with charms, as he was able to produce a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] (a very advanced and difficult charm) to the size of a [[giant]].<ref name="COSG"/>
*'''[[Wandless magic]]''': Andros was also capable of producing his incredibly large Patronus without using a [[wand]],<ref name="COSG"/> showing him to him to have been a very powerful wizard to have been able to produce such an advanced charm without a wand.

==Behind the scenes==
*Although Andros was featured on a famous wizard card, it is known that the size and corporeal form of a Patronus has no influence upon its power. In fact, another famous Patronus, belonging to [[Illyius]], took the form of a little [[mouse]], but was still of immense power.<ref name="WBS">{{WBS}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*The word ''Anēr'', of which ''Andros'' is the genitive form, is Ancient Greek for "man". The word is currently used as a prefix in many non-Greek words. It is also the name of a Greek island (Andros), an Atlantic island, and several fictional characters in franchises such as ''Power Rangers'', ''Sandman'' and ''Marvel Comics''.
