==Biography==
[[File:The Bloody Pages.png|220x220px|thumb|left|A Muggle newspaper reporting the arrests in the Page family]]
Born and raised somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]], Reggie was the elder son of a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] father and a [[Wizardkind|witch]] mother. He had a [[Daniel Page's sister|sister]] and a younger brother, [[Daniel Page]]. Unlike Daniel, he wasn't born with any magical abilities. He attended a Muggle primary school.<ref name="MA"/>

His father was involved in illicit activities and in due time, he joined in. At some point, they were eventually caught by the Muggle [[police]] and arrested. His mother tried to intervene using magic so they could escape, scaring the police and violating the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]].<ref name="MA"/>

While they were tried and sentenced to a Muggle prison, her violation of the Statute of Secrecy led to her being sentenced to [[Azkaban]]. The family's arrest was covered by a Muggle newspaper, dubbing them "The Bloody Pages".<ref name="MA"/>
