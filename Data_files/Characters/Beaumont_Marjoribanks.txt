'''Beaumont Marjoribanks''' ([[1742]]—[[1845]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and pioneer in the field of [[Herbology]], having collected and classified many rare [[magic]]al plants and flowers.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
He was the first person to have discovered [[Gillyweed]]. For his contributions to the field of Herbology, he was featured on a bronze [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

During the [[1993-1994 school year]], there was a bust of Marjoribanks on the [[History of Magic Classroom]], next to [[Cuthbert Binns]]'s desk.<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Marjoribanks was a well-renowned and prominent professional [[Herbologist]], who would have been exceptionally knowledgeable in the study of magical and mundane plants and fungi, and very skilled in the handling and cultivation of them. He collected and studied many rare magical plants and flowers throughout his lifetime, earning him recognition on a bronze [[Chocolate Frog Card]] for his superb achievements in this field.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*His first name "Beaumont" comes from a French surname meaning "beautiful mountain."
*His surname comes from the Scottish Lowlands [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clan_Marjoribanks Clan Marjoribanks], whose name is (according to legend) derived from the area originally called "Marjorie's Banks" in honour of Princess [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marjorie_Bruce Marjorie Bruce], who owned the territory alongside her husband. The name "Marjorie" is derived in part from the name of the herb ''marjoram.''

==Behind the scenes==
*Despite the fact that it is said Majoribanks discovered Gillyweed, [[Elladora Ketteridge]] is said to have discovered its effects about a century earlier. This error would be fixed if the dates were switched, or if Majoribanks was alive before, or at the same time as Ketteridge, as he only discovered the existence of Gillyweed, while Ketteridge discovered its magical effects.
*There appear to be inconsistencies in the spelling of this individual's surname: in the video games, it appears to be spelt "Majorbanks". In the real-life [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s once released in the United States (which were penned by [[J. K. Rowling]]), it is spelt "[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/images/wizcards/03-beaumont-marjoribanks.jpg Marjoribanks]".
*The Chocolate Frog Card portrait of Marjoribanks featured in the video games appears to be a direct homage to [[Wikipedia:Rembrandt Peale|Rembrandt Peale]]'s 1801 oil painting [[Wikipedia:Rubens Peale with a Geranium|''Rubens Peale with a Geranium'']] in both pose and setting.
