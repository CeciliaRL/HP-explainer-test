'''Torquil McTavish''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] who was one of the most revered [[Broomstick|broom]] [[broom racing|flyers]] in [[Europe]] in the mid-[[18th century]].

==Biography==
In [[1754]], McTavish agreed to participate in a [[Broomstick|broom]] [[broom racing|race]] from [[Aberdeen]] to [[Rome]] with the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Silvio Astolfi]], his bitter rival.<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}}</ref>

The race was held at night in order to avoid attracting [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] attention. Arriving in Rome at dawn, McTavish and Astolfi were seen racing toward the finish line at the [[Coliseum]], but at that point, a violent confrontation between supporters of the two racers who were gathered there broke out. During the course of the fight, Astolfi was [[Pullus|transformed]] into a [[Chicken (animal)|chicken]], and McTavish was hit with a [[knee-reversal hex]]. The conflict culminated in an explosion that left the Colosseum in ruins.<ref name="WBoS" />

Thanks to [[Orabella Nuttley]], who stepped forward and fixed a few columns with her [[Mending Charm]], the damage to the Colosseum was undone by the time that the Muggles woken by the explosion finally showed up at the scene. All they found was a few strangely-dressed men attempting to calm the agitated Astolfi, who was still a chicken. What happened to McTavish is unknown, but it can be presumed that his knees were returned to facing the proper way.<ref name="WBoS" />
