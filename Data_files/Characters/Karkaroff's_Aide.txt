This '''individual''' (b. prior to [[October]] [[1977]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Durmstrang Institute]] as a student during the mid-[[1990s]] and served as the aide of former [[Headmaster]] [[Igor Karkaroff]] during the time of the [[Triwizard Tournament]].<ref name="GOFF">{{GOF|F}}</ref><ref name="Hpana"/>

==Biography==

===Early Life===
He was born sometime before [[1976]], presumably somewhere in [[Europe]].<ref name="nationality">As Durmstrang is a wizarding school located in the far north of Europe, he was presumably born somewhere in Europe himself.</ref>  He attended Durmstrang Institute sometime during the [[1980s]]. He graduated sometime before [[1994]] and later became Igor Karkaroff's aide.<ref name="GOFF"/><ref name="Hpana"/>

===Triwizard Tournament===
In October [[1994]], he travelled with his school to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where his school was to compete in the [[1994–1995 Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]].<ref name="GOFF"/> Unlike the other students, he didn't put his name in the [[Goblet of Fire]] as he was a past student.<ref name="Hpana">[https://hpana.com/news/18938/ Hpana]</ref>

At the [[Yule Ball]], he went with a [[Beauxbatons]] girl. They danced together during the ball and watched the [[Weird Sisters]] play.<ref name="GOFF"/>

He sat between Viktor Krum and [[Parvati Patil]] when [[Albus Dumbledore]] [[Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory|informed]] the students about the cause of the death of [[Cedric Diggory]] in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. He later returned to Durmstrang with Igor and the other students at the end of the school year.<ref name="GOFF"/>

==Physical appearance==
He had oily jet black hair, hazel eyes, a hooked nose, high cheekbones, a moustache, and facial hair on his chin and jawline.<ref name="GOFF"/>

==Behind the scenes==
{{Dialogue a-b|Karkaroff's Aide|May I have your arm?|Parvati Patil|Arm, leg, I'm yours.|Karkaroff's Aide asking Parvati Patil for a dance at the Yule Ball|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)}}
*Karkaroff's Aide was portrayed by [[Tolga Safer]] in {{GOF|FA}}. Tolga Safer auditioned for the role of [[Viktor Krum]] but did not get the part, mainly because he did not look like the character. [[Mike Newell]], the director, was so impressed with Tolga's acting that he made the role of Karkaroff's Aide especially for him.<ref name="Hpana"/>
*In the film, this individual asks [[Parvati Patil]] to dance with him during the [[Yule Ball]], after [[Harry Potter]] rejects her. However in the book, Parvati is instead asked to dance by a boy from Beauxbatons, which she does eagerly.
*At least on occasion during filming, Tolga hung out with [[Stanislav Ianevski]], doing card tricks among other means of killing time. This can be seen on the bonus DVD for the film.
*In {{LEGO|Y1}}, this character may have been made more generic, being simply called "Durmstrang Student".
*It is possible that this individual is [[Poliakoff]]. However, this individual is trusted by Karkaroff, whereas Poliakoff is regarded by him as a "disgusting child",<ref name="GOF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref> so this in highly unlikely.
