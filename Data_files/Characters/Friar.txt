The '''Friar''' (fl. Middle Ages) was from a medieval [[Worcestershire]] Monastery during the [[Middle Ages]]. When [[Benedict|Brother Benedict]] was bitten in the nose by a "talking [[Ferret]]" (actually a [[Jarvey]]), the Friar did not believe him, and asked him if he had been drinking [[Boniface|Brother Boniface]]'s [[Turnip Wine]].<ref>{{FB|R}} - ''A Brief History of Muggle Awareness of Fantastic Beasts''</ref>
