}}'''Mina Lima''' was presumably a famous [[Wizardkind|witch]]. ''[[The Quibbler]]'' ran an article in [[1996]] which claimed that she was the same person as [[Stubby Boardman]]. However, the veracity of this claim is doubtful, given the fact that the magazine published the exact same claim regarding [[Sirius Black]] the [[1995|year]] before.<ref name="HBPF">{{HBP|F}} {{see image 2 |File:MinaLimaQuibbler2.jpg|File:MinaLimaQuibbler.jpg}}</ref>
