==Etymology==
"Kevin" is an anglicised form of the Irish name ''Caoimhín'', derived from the older Irish ''Cóemgein'', composed of the Old Irish elements ''cóem'' "kind, gentle, handsome" and ''gein'' "birth". Saint Caoimhín established a monastery in Glendalough, [[Ireland]] in the [[First millennium A.D.|6th century]] and is the patron saint of [[Dublin]]. It became popular in the English-speaking world outside of Ireland in the [[20th century]].
