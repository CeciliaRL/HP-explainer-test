'''Gondoline Oliphant''' ([[1720]]-[[1799]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] made famous for studying the life and habits of [[troll]]s.<ref name="COSG"/><ref name="JKRS"/>

==Biography==
In [[1799]], she was clubbed to [[death]] in the [[Cotswolds]] while sketching. For her achievements in [[Magizoology]], she was featured on a silver [[Famous Witches and Wizards Cards|Famous Wizard card]] as part of the [[Chocolate Frog Card]] series.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref><ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}}</ref>

There was a bust of her at [[Hogwarts Castle]], on a secret passage leading from the fourth floor to the second floor.<ref name="POAG"/>

==Etymology==
*The surname Oliphant is derived from an archaic English word for "[[elephant]]." J.R.R. Tolkien included huge, elephant-like creatures known as [[Wikipedia:Mûmak|oliphaunts]] in his novel ''The Lord of the Rings.''
*The name Gondoline is perhaps a further nod to Tolkien: in the ''Silmarillion'', there was an Elven city called Gondolin, which remained hidden for centuries before being destroyed.
