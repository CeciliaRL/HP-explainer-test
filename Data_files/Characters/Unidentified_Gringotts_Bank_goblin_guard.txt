This '''[[goblin]]''' was a guard at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] in [[1991]]. He wore a uniform of scarlet and gold, and stood by the bank's outer doors to greet visitors. He was described as having a pointed beard, a swarthy, clever face, and was about a head shorter than [[Harry Potter]] was when he was eleven.<ref name="PS5">{{PS|B|5}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{PS|FA}} he appears outside [[Vault 713]] in a photo in the [[Daily Prophet]]. He is seen talking to the [[Gringotts Head Goblin|Head Goblin]] and then walking away. The goblin was played by [[Binde Johal]] in the film.
*In the film and game he doesn't have a pointed beard.
