{{Quote|POTTER!|the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] screaming at [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2}}

==Biography==
He and [[Unidentified Hogsmeade Death Eater (II)|another Death Eater]] were searching for [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] when the [[trio]] tried to find a safe place in the village.<ref name="DHF2"/>

He later fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], where he was seen participating in the [[Onslaught at the Viaduct]], where he casts the [[Cruciatus Curse]]. He was later called back to the [[Forbidden Forest]]. He was also present at Voldemort's speech of [[Harry Potter]]'s "dead" body. After Harry revealed himself to be alive, he was seen [[Apparition|apparating]] away, although he was later seen inside the [[Great Hall]], implying he was only transporting to the inside of the castle.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

After Voldemort's defeat and death, he was possibly killed or imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for his crimes as a Death Eater.

*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, he would have been accomplished with dark magic,<ref name="DHF2"/> likely including the [[Unforgivable Curses]].
*'''[[Duelling]]''': He participated in the first half of the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], meaning he was skilled in [[Martial magic|magical combat]] to an extent, as he did survive.<ref name="DHF2"/>
