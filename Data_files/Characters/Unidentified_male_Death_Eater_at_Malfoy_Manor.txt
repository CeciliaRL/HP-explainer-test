This '''[[Dark Wizard]]''' was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and servant of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]].

==Biography==
He was one of the many Death Eaters present at the [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor|meeting]] in [[Malfoy Manor]]. He was sitting in front of [[Amycus Carrow]] during the meeting. When [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] asked one of his followers to hand over their [[wand]], he remained silent in the deeply terrifying and malevolent presence of his Dark Lord.<ref>{{DH|F1}}</ref>

This Death Eater may have taken part in the Battle of Hogwarts on the [[2 May]], [[1998]]. He was presumably killed, sent to [[Azkaban]], or forced to go on the run following his master's defeat at the hands of Harry Potter.

==Behind the scenes==
*The Death Eater was played by [[Anthony John Crocker]] in {{DH|F1}}.
