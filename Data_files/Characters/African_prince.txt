{{Quote|[[Quirinus Quirrell|His]] [[Quirinus Quirrell's turban|turban]], he told them, had been given to him by an African prince as a thank-you for getting rid of a troublesome [[zombie]], but they weren't sure they believed this story.|Alleged African prince|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
An '''[[Africa]]n [[prince]]''' allegedly gifted [[Quirinus Quirrell]] with a [[Quirinus Quirrell's turban|turban]] as a token of his gratitude after the [[professor]] had rid him of a bothersome [[zombie]]. However, Quirrell's [[first year]] [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] students in the [[1991â€“1992 school year]] were unsure if they believed his story or not.<ref name="PS8">{{PS|B|8}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Although [[Quirinus Quirrell]] claimed to have received his turban from this individual,<ref name="PS8" /> Quirrell used the turban to hide the face of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] on the back of his head.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref> Therefore, it is possible that this individual does not exist, particularly as there are no [[Wizardkind|wizarding]] princes,<ref name="HBP16">{{HBP|B|16}}</ref> and it would be odd if a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] prince knew about a zombie. Additionally, zombies are known to be native to the [[United States of America]],<ref name="PM">{{PM}}</ref> as opposed to the continent of [[Africa]].
