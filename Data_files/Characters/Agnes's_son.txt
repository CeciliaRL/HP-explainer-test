An '''unknown individual''' was the son of [[Agnes]], a patient in the long-term [[Janus Thickey Ward]] at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]. He intended to visit her over [[Christmas]] in [[1995]]. When the [[Healer]] [[Miriam Strout]] told Agnes of the [[owl]] he had sent informing them that he would be coming, her only reply was to give several loud barks.<ref name="OOTP23">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref>
