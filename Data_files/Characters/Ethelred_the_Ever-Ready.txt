==Etymology==
*The name [[wikipedia:Ethelred the Unready|Ethelred]] is composed from Old English elements æðele, meaning "noble", and ræd, meaning "counsel", being bombastic and common in the Royal House of Wessex.

==Behind the scenes==
*Ethelred the Ever-Ready's name was likely inspired by King [[wikipedia:Ethelred the Unready|Ethelred II of England]], who was known as ''the Unready'' after his death (from Old English ''Æþelræd Unræd).'' In that time, "unready" was probably understood pejorative as "evil counsel" (opposite to the name) or "bad plan"; the king was considered ill-advised or indecisive in his conflict with the Danes.
