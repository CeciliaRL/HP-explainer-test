==Biography==
===Early life===
Dorcus was born into a [[Twelvetrees family|wizarding family]] sometime in the [[18th century]].<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> She attended [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], but did not do well academically, and apparently did not go on to pursue a career afterwards.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> At the time her father, [[Aristotle Twelvetrees]], rose to the office of [[Keeper of Treasure and Dragots]] under [[President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America|President]] [[Emily Rappaport]], Dorcus was still living with her parents, and rarely used [[magic]].<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> Described as "pretty" but "dim", her primary interests included fashion, styling her [[Human hair|hair]], and organising parties.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" />

===Bartholomew Barebone affair===
Dorcus met [[Bartholomew Barebone]], a handsome [[Muggle|No-Maj]] at a neighbourhood [[picnic]] one day. She was instantly smitten and performed "[[spell|little tricks]]" for him.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> Interpreting his interest as nothing more than politeness and curiosity, she duly answered his "artless" queries.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> In the course of these interactions, she revealed to him the locations of Ilvermorny and the headquarters of the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]]. She also provided him information about the [[International Confederation of Wizards]] and the manners in which the wizarding community endeavoured to hide itself from the [[Muggle world|No-Maj world]].<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" />

Unbeknownst to her, Bartholomew was in fact descended from a [[Scourers|Scourer]] line, meaning that he vehemently believed in the existence of [[magic]], and that all witches and wizards were evil.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> Having manipulated Dorcus into revealing as much about the [[wizarding world]] as he could, he proceeded to steal her [[wand]].<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> He showed the wand to as many newspaper reporters as possible, and a few were motivated to publish pictures of it, describing it as having a "kick like a [[mule]]" when waved.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> He also printed and distributed leaflets listing the wizarding addresses Dorcus had revealed to him, and sent letters to important No-Majs, prompting some to investigate whether the "evil occult parties" he described were actually occurring.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" />

After shooting at a group of No-Majs he wrongly assumed to be [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]] employees, Bartholomew was arrested by No-Maj authorities, but the damage had already been done.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> The MACUSA was left struggling to cope with one of the most massive breaches of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|International Statute of Secrecy]] in history.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> They attempted to [[Memory Charm|modify]] the memories of all No-Majs exposed to the leaked information, but, as President Rappaport testified at a public inquiry, there was no way to be certain they had obliviated everyone.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" />

===Imprisonment and later life===
Many within the magical community advocated imprisoning Dorcus for life for her actions.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> Some even called for her to be executed.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> However, she ultimately spent only a year in prison, emerging a traumatised and thoroughly disgraced woman.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> She lived out the rest of her days in isolation, with only a mirror and a [[parrot]] to keep her company.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" />

The Twelvetrees-Barebone affair prompted the passage of [[Rappaport's Law]] in [[1790]].<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> This law banned American wizards and witches from [[marriage|marrying]] or befriending No-Majs, and led to the total segregation of the No-Maj and wizarding communities in the United States.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" />
