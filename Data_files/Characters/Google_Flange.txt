==Behind the scenes==
*The portrait of Google Flange was based on a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/52/King_Charles_I_by_Gerrit_van_Honthorst_sm.jpg 1628 portrait] of [[Wikipedia:Charles I of England|Charles I of England]] by [[Wikipedia:Gerard van Honthorst|Gerard van Honthorst]].
*Writing the word "abracadabra" repeatedly to form a triangle, as it appears in the portrait, is an ancient mystical practise.<ref name="abrawiki">"{{Wikilink|Abracadabra}}" on Wikipedia</ref> [[wikipedia:Quintus Serenus Sammonicus|Quintus Serenus Sammonicus]], a [[First millennium A.D.|third century A.D.]] [[wikipedia:Ancient Rome|Roman]] physician, advised people afflicted with [[wikipedia:malaria|malaria]] to wear amulets bearing such an inscription, claiming it warded off disease.<ref name="abrawiki" />
*At {{MHP}}, the portrait of [[Poderick Crookshank]] was erroneously put in a frame inscribed "Sir Google Flange," but Crookshank was correctly identified in ''[[The Paintings of Hogwarts: Masterpieces from the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Sets]].
