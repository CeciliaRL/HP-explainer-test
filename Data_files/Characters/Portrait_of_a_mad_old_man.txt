{{Dialogue a-b-a|Mad old man|Watch it there boy.|Sleeping hermit|We're trying to sleep here!|Yes we are.|This portrait and [[Portrait of a sleeping hermit|another]] to [[Harry Potter]].|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)}}
This '''[[portrait]]''' depicted a [[Insanity|mad]] old man, and it was hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]], in the [[Lower Chambers Portrait Corridor]], next to a [[portrait of a sleeping hermit]].<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}} - Chapter 17 (''Who's There?'')</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This portrait is depicted wearing an upside-down funnel as a hat. The inverted funnel has, since the Middle Ages, been used to represent the mad. It has, therefore, appeared in several artistic depictions of mad men through the centuries such as [[Wikipedia:Hieronymus Bosch|Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[Wikipedia:Ship of Fools (painting)|The Ship of Fools]]'' and ''[[Wikipedia:Allegory of Gluttony and Lust|Allegory of Gluttony and Lust]]'', and, more recently and perhaps more notably, is present in many depictions of the Tin Woodman of [[Wikipedia:L. Frank Baum|L. Frank Baum]]'s classic novel ''[[Wikipedia:The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', although that is never specifically mentioned in the story - it stemmed from W.W. Denslow's original illustrations for the book.
