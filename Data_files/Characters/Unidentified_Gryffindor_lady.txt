This '''lady''' was a [[wizardkind|witch]] who, in her lifetime, was [[Head of Gryffindor House]].<ref name="MHP" /> A portrait of her hung in [[Gryffindor Tower]].

In [[1994]], when [[Harry Potter]] opened his [[golden egg]], her portrait was terrified of the sound and was seen holding her hands over her ears. In [[1995]], she asked [[Hermione Granger]] to fetch a [[House-elf]] so it could clean her frame. Hermione gave her a lecture on [[Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare|S.P.E.W.]]

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{OOTP}}, she was credited as "GCR Portrait Female 1", and was voiced by [[Isobel Middleton]]. Her portrait also appears in the [[Gryffindor]] Common Room in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{HBP}}, but does not speak.
