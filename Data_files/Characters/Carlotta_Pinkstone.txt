==Biography==
===Early life===
Carlotta Pinkstone was born in [[1922]], somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]]. If she enrolled at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], she attended the school in around [[1933]] to [[1940]], under [[Headmaster]] [[Armando Dippet]].

===Adulthood===
{{Quote|STOP SPELL SUPPRESSION!|One of Carlotta's activism signs|Wizard of the Month}}
It was Ms. Pinkstone's belief that the annulment of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] (established by the [[International Confederation of Wizards]] in [[1692]]) and consequent mixing of the [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] and [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] societies was opportune and convenient in the [[20th century]]. As such, she became a vigorous activist for that cause, and deliberately and unlawfully used magic indiscriminately in public places, in full sight of [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], which led to a series of convictions and imprisonments in [[Azkaban]].<ref name="PSG"/><ref name="COSG"/><ref name="POAG"/>

Pinkstone was still alive by the [[1990s]], by which time she was featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]], which pictured her symbolically in shackles.<ref name="PSG"/><ref name="COSG"/><ref name="POAG"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Wandless magic]]''': Carlotta Pinkstone was a powerful and accomplished [[Wizardkind|witch]], who was fully capable of casting [[spell]]s wandlessly, which is incredibly difficult and advanced [[magic]].<ref name="PSG"/><ref name="COSG"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Carlotta Pinkstone was ''[[Wizard of the Month]]'' on {{JKRS}}, in which she is shown with black hair despite having previously been pictured with red hair in all of her video game appearances.
*Her name may be a reference to the famous British feminist {{W|Emmeline Pankhurst}}, who was known for her radical public activism with regards to women's rights.
