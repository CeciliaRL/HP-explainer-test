==Etymology==
The name Argo derives from the Greek word ''argos'', meaning “swift”.<ref>"[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=argo&searchmode=none Argo]" on The Online Etymology Dictionary</ref> 
In Greek mythology, [[Wikipedia:Argo|Argo]] was the ship on which [[Wikipedia:Jason|Jason]] and his companions, the [[Wikipedia:Argonaut|Argonauts]], sailed on their journey to find the [[Wikipedia:Golden Fleece|Golden Fleece]]. [[Wikipedia:Pyrite|Pyrite]] is a shiny yellow mineral, which is also called Fool's Gold, due to its resemblance to the precious metal.

==Behind the scenes==
*This character is mentioned only on a page from an early draft of {{PS}} which [[J. K. Rowling]] posted on her [[J. K. Rowling's official site|website]].<ref name="lex" /> He may have been related to [[Pyrites]], a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who was included in early drafts of the same book, but was also discarded.
*It is also possible that the Death Eater in question was supposed to be Argo Pyrites, and that the two are one and the same.
