'''Jesus''', also known as '''Jesus of Nazareth''' or '''Jesus Christ''', was the central figure of [[Christianity]], regarded by most Christian denominations as the son of [[God]], born of a human mother, [[Mary]].<ref name="wikipedia">"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus Jesus]" on Wikipedia</ref> He was considered an important prophet in [[Islam]].<ref name="wikipedia" />

There was a stained glass window in the [[St Jerome's Church]] in [[Godric's Hollow]] which depicted Jesus along with the authors of the four books of the Gospel ([[Matthew]], [[Mark]], [[Luke]] and [[John]]).<ref>{{HPFW}} {{see image|File:Stained Glass Godric's Hollow.jpg}}</ref>

One of the known works by artist [[Haniball Carathi]] was a "little piece" depicting "our Ladie" (i.e., Mary) with the presumably infant Jesus "upon her right hand."<ref name="lc">''Label Collection'' book in the {{HPWC}} box set {{see image|File:BelchPowder.jpg}}.</ref> A catalogue listing for this work was incorporated into the label of the [[Belch Powder]] box.<ref name="lc" />
