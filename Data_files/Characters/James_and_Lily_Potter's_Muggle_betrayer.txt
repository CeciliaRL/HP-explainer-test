This '''Muggle''' betrayed [[James Potter I|James]] and [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Potter]] when asked by [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] to reveal their location of [[Godric's Hollow]] in October [[1981]].<ref name="ghostplot">"Opening Chapters of Philosopher's Stone" - [[J. K. Rowling's official site|J.K.Rowling Official Site]] - archived [http://web.archive.org/web/20110623035050/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=1 here]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The muggle only appeared in an early and abandoned draft of {{PS}}, portraying the role that was eventually given to [[Peter Pettigrew]].<ref name="ghostplot" />
*It is likely that the Muggle would have given their location willingly, as Rowling described them as a "horrible Muggle" who betrayed them in a similar way that Peter had, rather than someone who was made to by means of [[magic]] or threats.<ref name="ghostplot" />
*Since Voldemort had hated Muggles and [[Muggle-born]]s, it is unknown why Rowling originally wanted a Muggle to betray the Potters for him. It is possible that they had no idea who he was, but just wanted to cause trouble, while Voldemort saw them as a means to his plan.
