The '''''Shepherdess''''' was a portrait hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]], on the [[Staircase between the ground-floor corridor and second-floor corridor|Charms Staircase]]. She was depicted in a white dress, with her staff and with her flock behind her, in the background. She spoke in a strong West country accent.<ref name="OOTPG">{{OOTP|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The Shepherdess is quite similar to a [[Girl with Flowers|portrait of a girl with flowers]] featured in the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' (portrayed by [[Violet Columbus]]).
*This individual may have died sometime prior to [[1995]], as many portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] depict deceased individuals.
*She is voiced by [[Eleanor Hans]].
*When she declared that [[Google Stump]] is 'a portrait with answers,' she made a reference to the web search engine {{W|Google}}, which is primary online tool used to look for information.
