{{Quote|Do you want a bit of scandal? I knew a girl at Hogwarts — Bethany Swordbane — who was obsessed with Goblins. She would make me go to Gringotts with her and we would stand in the lobby for hours while she ogled. It was… uncomfortable.|[[Constance Pickering]]|Harry Potter: Wizards Unite}}
'''Bethany Swordbane''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] around the same time as [[Constance Pickering]]. Obsessed with [[Goblin]]s, she would make Constance go to with her to [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], where they would stand in the lobby for hours while she ogled at the bankers being hard at work.<ref name="WU"/>
