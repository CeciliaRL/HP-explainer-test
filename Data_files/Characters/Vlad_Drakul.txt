'''Count Vlad Drakul''' (b. [[1390]]) was a notorious [[vampire]] who inspired the author [[Bram Stoker]] to create his famous character [[Count Dracula]]. Drakul had a son, [[Vlad the Impaler]], who presumably shared his father's notorious reputation.<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Wikipedia:Vlad II Dracul|Vlad II Dracul]], (Vlad the Dragon) was a "voivode" (duke or prince) of Wallachia (a region that corresponds with modern-day Southern Romania), and reigned from 1436 to 1442, and again from 1443 to 1447.
*In reality, there are [[Wikipedia:Dracula#Background|various theories]] as to Stoker's inspiration for Dracula. He was inspired by a Wallachian duke named Dracula (i.e. Dracul's son or Dragon's son), so it is Dracul's son Vlad the Impaler who is more commonly considered the source of inspiration.
