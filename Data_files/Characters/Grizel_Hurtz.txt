'''Grizel Hurtz''' was an advice columnist who wrote for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. She dealt with queries of an emotional nature, while her co-columnists [[Zamira Gulch]], [[Helbert Spleen]], and [[Dempster Wiggleswade]] addressed more straightforward issues. On one occasion, Hurtz responded to a letter from a [[Lilith Molesby|lovelorn witch]], who was thinking about using a [[Love Potion]] to attract the man whom she loved. Grizel suggested she use a [[Hate Potion|Hate potion]] instead, to rid herself of her obsession.<ref name="DP">[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[1 June|June 1st]].

==Etymology==
*Hurtz is a homophone of the English word ''hurts''. This may be a play on the term "agony aunt", which is a [[Great Britain|British]] slang term for a advice columnist.
