This '''[[Wizardkind|wizard]]''' (born c. 1969) attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1980]].

==Biography==
[[File:Unidentified Keeper.jpg|thumb|Keeper during his Hogwarts years.|left]]He started his education in [[1980]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into an unknown [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. At some point before or during the [[1985–1986 school year]], he became the [[Keeper]] of his House Quidditch team.<ref name="HM">{{HM}}</ref>

He continued playing on the team the following year and was well known for making bad Keeper related puns.<ref>{{HM|3|Q2|1}}</ref>

He later went on to play [[Quidditch]] professionally after graduating from Hogwarts. [[Ethan Parkin]] recruited him as the Keeper for [[Wigtown Wanderers]]' reserve team, after watching him play in the [[1986–1987 school year]]'s final.<ref name="HMQch2"/>

In the [[1987–1988 school year]], he learned of [[Orion Amari|Orion]]'s injury and returned to Hogwarts. He told [[Skye Parkin|Skye]] and [[Jacob's sibling]] about the legendary [[Golden Snitch]], escaped from the [[1927]] Quidditch Cup match. He said that he saw it in [[Hogsmeade]] and offered the team to catch it. While his story was untrue and a way to cheer up the team, Jacob's sibling did get the real legendary escaped Golden Snitch down. As a reward for this achievement, he gave Jacob's sibling his custom-made Keeper Gear.<ref>{{HM|4|Q3|The legendary snitch of Hogsmeade}}</ref>

==Possessions==
*'''Custom-made [[Keeper]] Gear''': This Keeper owned custom-made [[Keeper]] Gear that was tougher and more comfortable than the standard issue armor. He gave it to [[Jacob's sibling]] after they caught the legendary, escaped [[Golden Snitch]].

==Behind the scenes==
*His house is the same as that of [[Jacob's sibling]], which is chosen by the player.
*He may be the same person as the [[unidentified Gryffindor Keeper]] if Jacob's sibling is in [[Gryffindor]].
