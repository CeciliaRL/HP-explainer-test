{{Quote|&hellip; a foolish king who decided that he alone should have the power of magic.|The King's description|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
The '''King''' was one of the antagonists in a story from [[Beedle the Bard]]'s [[The Tales of Beedle the Bard|stories]] ''[[Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump]]''. He was a foolish and gullible ruler who condemned magic, which led to his founding of the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters]]. He was later revealed to have been jealous of [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] and their ability to use [[magic]].<ref name="TBB"/>

==Biography==
===The Brigade===
{{Quote|&hellip; commanded the head of his army to form a Brigade of Witch-Hunters, and issued them with a pack of ferocious black hounds.|The [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}

The [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] king in the story wanted to keep all the [[magic]] in the world for himself. In order to do so, he decided to gather all the [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] in the world, which led to him forming the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters]] and giving them wild hounds.<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|B}}</ref>

===An Instructor of Magic===
{{Quote|Wanted by King, an Instructor of Magic|The King's Proclamations|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}

Soon after the foundation of the Brigade, the King wanted to learn how to use [[magic]]. He issued proclamations throughout his kingdom that he required a teacher with [[magic]]al ability. Because they were hiding from the Brigade, no real [[Wizardkind|witches or wizards]] responded. However, a cunning [[Charlatan]] came to the palace claiming to be a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] with enormous skill. The charlatan performed a few simple tricks, which convinced the King of his [[magic]]al powers. The charlatan agreed to teach the king, despite having no [[magic]]al knowledge himself, in exchange for money, rubies, a silver chalice and fame.<ref name="TBB"/>

While the King and the [[Charlatan]] were practising waving their twigs, hopping in circles, and chanting meaningless rhymes, they heard [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] laughing hysterically from her cottage. This enraged the King, who demanded that the charlatan help him perform in front of his subjects to show off his new abilities. The charlatan attempted to back out by saying he had to go out of town and could not help him, but the King threatened to send the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters|brigade]] after the [[charlatan]]. He added that should anyone laugh at the performance, the [[Charlatan]]'s head would also be cut off.<ref name="TBB"/>

The next day, with help of [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]], the King and the [[Charlatan]] performed "their [[magic]]". They astonished the crowd by vanishing a hat and levitating a [[horse]], but when the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters|Captain of the Brigade]] asked if the King could make [[Sabre]], his dead hound, return to life, the King attempted in vain. [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] did nothing, because she knew that no [[magic]] could raise the dead. The crowd laughed at the King, and the King wanted to know why the [[spell]] wasn't working. The charlatan pointed to the bush, and said that a wicked [[Wizardkind|witch]] was blocking them. [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] ran from the bush, and when the hounds chased after her she vanished from sight, leaving the dogs barking at a tree.<ref name="TBB" />

===The King's promise===
{{Quote|You will erect a statue of Babbitty upon me, in memory of your poor washerwoman, and to remind you for ever of your foolishness!|[[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
The charlatan told the king and the crowd that [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] had turned into an apple tree, and that the tree must be cut down, because she is an "evil" witch. The king ordered for an axe to be brought, and the tree was quickly felled. As the crowd and the king started to leave, they heard cackling coming from the stump. [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] told the king that real [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] could not be cut in half, and that they should cut the charlatan in half to prove it. The charlatan confessed to being a fraud. The witch told them that the King was cursed, and that every time a [[Wizardkind|witch or wizard]] was harmed, the King himself would feel physical pain like an axe stroke in his side. [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] then demanded a statue be built of herself, to remind them of the harm they had done to [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]]. The King agreed to the promise and later disbanded the Brigade. Soon after, an old rabbit, who is assumed to be [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]], appeared out of a hole in the stump with a wand in its mouth, implying that [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] was an [[Animagus]]. She then left the kingdom. Forever after, the statue of [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] remained on top of the stump.<ref name="TBB" />

==Relationships==
===Witches and Wizards===
{{Quote|No true witch or wizard dared volunteer for the post, for they were hiding from the Brigade of Witch-Hunters&hellip;|The status of the King's Instructor of [[Magic]] post|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
[[Wizardkind|Wizards and witches]] in general loathed the King for creating the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters]], an organisation that hunted [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]]. When the King wanted to learn how to use [[magic]], he called for someone with [[magic]]al ability to teach him. No real [[Wizardkind|wizards or witches]] dared to respond for they were hiding from the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters]]. Ultimately, the King was jealous of [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]].<ref name="TBB" />

===The Charlatan===
{{Quote|The charlatan gave one of the twigs to the King and assured him that it was a wand with tremendous power|The Charlatan|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
[[File:Babbityrabbity.jpg|180px|thumb|left|The King and the Charlatan practising their "magic"]]
When the King called for any [[Wizardkind|wizards or witches]] to teach him [[magic]], a charlatan came to the palace claiming to be a wizard with enormous skill. The charlatan performed a few simple tricks, which convinced the King of his [[magic]]al powers and he taught the King, despite not knowing any [[magic]] himself. He accepted a post as the King's [[magic]] instructor purely to benefit his own wealth and social standing.<ref name="TBB"/>

When ordered by the King to perform magic in front of the people, the Charlatan went to [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]], knowing that she was a [[Wizardkind|witch]]. The charlatan blackmailed her into concealing herself inside a bush while the King gave his magical display and to perform the spells for him, without the King's knowledge. Babbitty agreed. The next day, the charlatan and the King, with help from [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]], performed [[magic]]. However, the King did not succeed in bringing [[Sabre|a dead dog]] back to life, so the charlatan accused Babbitty of blocking his spells, causing [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] to flee. When [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] turned into her [[Animagus]] form and hid under a tree, it was chopped in half. But when she told the king that no [[Wizardkind|witch or wizard]] could be chopped in half, and they should prove this by chopping the Charlatan in half, the Charlatan confessed that he was a fraud and was sent to the dungeon by order of the King.<ref name="TBB" />

===Babbitty===
{{Quote|Very good, but you have not yet made amends to Babbitty!|[[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
[[File:Babitty.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]], the King's washerwoman]]
[[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] was the king's washerwoman. She thought that the Charlatan and King's "lessons" were ridiculous and laughed at the king, causing the charlatan to become endangered. When the Charlatan came to see her, he blackmailed [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] to perform the King's spells for him without his knowledge, or else he would denounce her as a [[Wizardkind|witch]] to the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters]]. [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] smiled and agreed to do "anything in her power" to help the charlatan (leaving herself a very large loophole in the process). Despite Babbity's voiced concerns about what would happen if the king attempted an impossible spell, the charlatan merely shrugged it off. The next day, with the help of [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]], the King and the Charlatan performed "their magic". But when one of the [[Brigade of Witch-Hunters|brigade]] asked if the King could make his dead hound return to life, the King tried in vain. [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] did nothing, knowing that no [[magic]] could raise the dead. The charlatan told the King and the crowd that [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] had turned into a tree, and that the tree must be cut down, because she is an "evil" witch. After they cut the tree down, they heard the sound of loud cackling coming from the stump. [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] told the petrified King that by cutting a [[Wizardkind|witch]] in half, he had unleashed a terrible curse upon his kingdom and every stroke of harm that he inflicted upon fellow [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] would feel like an axe stroke in his side. The King promised that he would issue a proclamation at once, protecting [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] of the kingdom and to erect a statue of [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]] on the stump.<ref name="TBB" />

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|At that, the King fell to his knees too, and told that he would issue a proclamation at once, protecting all the witches and wizards of the kingdom, and allowing to practise their magic in peace.|The Foolish King|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
The King was a foolish [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] who both coveted and feared [[magic]]. He was ignorant of the true nature of [[magic]] and wizardkind. It is for this reason that he believed he could become a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] by waving a [[wand]] and saying a few simple incantations. Being gullible is also a trait that the King expressed, which is why he swallowed the preposterous suggestions of both the [[Charlatan]] and [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]]. Additionally, he was quite selfish, as is demonstrated in the story by his ability to not care about how many [[Wizardkind|wizards and witches]] he had to kill to get what he wanted.<ref name="TBB" />
