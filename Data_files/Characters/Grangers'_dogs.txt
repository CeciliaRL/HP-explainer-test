These '''two [[dog]]s''' were owned by [[Hermione Granger's father|Mr]] and [[Hermione Granger's mother|Mrs Granger]], and lived with them in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>[http://allbyourselves.wordpress.com/2011/01/11/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-part-1-movie-script/ ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1'' script]</ref> It is unclear if they obtained the dogs as part of their new life caused by having their [[False memory spell|memories modified]], or if they were owned by the family prior to this.
