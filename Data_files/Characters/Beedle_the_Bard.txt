{{Quote|If his stories accurately reflect his opinions, he rather liked Muggles, whom he regarded as ignorant rather than malevolent; he mistrusted [[Dark Arts|Dark Magic]], and he believed that the worst excesses of wizardkind sprang from the all-too-human traits of cruelty, apathy or arrogant misapplication of their own talents. The heroes and heroines who triumph in his stories are not those with the most powerful magic, but rather those who demonstrate the most kindness, common sense, and ingenuity.|[[J. K. Rowling (in-universe)|J. K. Rowling]] regarding Beedle|The Tales of Beedle the Bard}}
