'''Lilith Molesby''' was a lovelorn [[Great Britain|British]] [[wizardkind|witch]] who wrote in to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' problem page and had her letter published in the [[1 June]] [[1999]] issue.<ref name="dp3">''[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]'', Issue 3 (see [https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/lilith-molesby/ this entry] on the Harry Potter Lexicon)</ref>

==Biography==
In the letter, Lilith sought advice on how to get a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] to fall in [[love]] with her, reporting that this man had told her friends he would rather be "beaten to death by [[troll]]s than take her out for dinner." She asked whether giving the wizard a [[Love Potion]] could help resolve her dilemma. Her letter was answered by [[Grizel Hurtz]], who advised her to start using [[Hate Potion]]s instead, as this would be preferable to having to constantly "doctor" her beloved's drinks.<ref name="dp3" />
