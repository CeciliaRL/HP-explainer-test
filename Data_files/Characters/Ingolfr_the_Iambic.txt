'''Ingolfr the Iambic''' was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and poet in the early [[1400s]]. He wrote a [[Seeker's verse|verse]] about the game of [[Quidditch]] that showed how the game had spread to [[Europe]].<ref name="QTA8">{{QTA|R|8}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*The name Ingólfr, was derived from the name of the Germanic god ''Ing'' combined with ''úlfr'' meaning "wolf".
*Iambic is likely a reference to [[Wikipedia:Iambic pentameter|iambic pentameter]], a common poetry metre best known for its extensive use by [[William Shakespeare]]. Oddly, his only known poem is not in an iambic metre, but instead anapestic tetrameter.
