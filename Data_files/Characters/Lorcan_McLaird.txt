'''Minister Lorcan McLaird''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]], a former [[Ravenclaw]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as well as, later in his life, [[Great Britain|British]] [[Minister for Magic]] from [[1923]] to [[1925]].<ref name="pottermore">{{PM}} introduction for Ravenclaws (transcription available [http://lady-slytherin-forever.tumblr.com/post/9001220525/ravenclaw-spoilers-stop-reading-if-you-dont-want-to here])</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Lorcan McLaird was born no later than [[1906]], somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]]. His surname suggests he was Scottish, or had Scottish ancestry.

In his youth, he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], where he was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

===As Minister for Magic===
McLaird rose to the office of [[Minister for Magic]] of [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]] in [[1923]]. He was quite a talented [[wizardkind|wizard]], but was considered something of an eccentric, as he liked to communicate by puffing smoke from the tip of his [[wand]]. Eventually, he was forced out of office in [[1925]] due to irritation at his eccentricities.<ref name="pottermore2">{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>

The ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' reported in its [[29 November]] [[1926]] issue that [[Ravenclaw]] students were planning to honour McLaird.<ref name="FBF">{{FB|F}} {{See image|File:Daily Prophet - 29 Nov 1926.png}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Luna Lovegood]] may have named her son — [[Lorcan Scamander|Lorcan]] — after this man, probably in admiration for his eccentricity.
*Calvin Coolidge, the thirtieth President of the United States, was also known for being incredibly taciturn. He, too, came into office in 1923.
