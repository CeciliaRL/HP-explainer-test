This '''[[snake]]''' was presumably a pet of [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] [[Morfin Gaunt]], and was owned by him sometime before [[Bob Ogden]]'s visit to [[House of Gaunt|his family]]'s [[Gaunt Shack|home]] in [[1925]]. The snake had presumably done something to upset Morfin, as he killed it and nailed it to the shack's door sometime prior to this event. He would later threaten the same fate to [[Morfin Gaunt's second snake|another snake]] he owned, presumably as a replacement for the first. [[Tom Riddle Senior]] and his "darling", [[Cecilia]], would later react with shock and disgust at the sight of the dead snake on display, seeing it as further proof of the talk in [[Little Hangleton]] about Morfin's madness.<ref name="HBP10">{{HBP|B|10}}</ref>
