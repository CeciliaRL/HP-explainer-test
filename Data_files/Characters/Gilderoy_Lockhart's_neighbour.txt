{{Quote|The most efficient way of [[De-gnoming|dealing with]] this [[Gnome|potato-headed garden blight]] is to [[Knockback Jinx|''Flipendo'']] the little blighter, grab him by the legs and fling him over a low wall or hedgerow – preferably not into your neighbour's smaller and less cared for garden!|[[Gilderoy Lockhart]], ''[[Marauding with Monsters]]''|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)}}
This '''individual''' lived next-door to [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]. According to Lockhart, [[Gilderoy Lockhart's neighbour's garden|his garden]] was much smaller and less cared for than [[Gilderoy Lockhart's garden|his]].<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}} - Console versions</ref>
