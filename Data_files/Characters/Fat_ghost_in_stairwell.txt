==Behind the scenes==
*This ghost's identity has been an ongoing matter of discussion for the Harry Potter community.<ref>[https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/11424/who-is-the-ghost-on-the-back-of-the-goblet-of-fire/217069 Who is the ghost on the back of The Goblet of Fire?] at [https://scifi.stackexchange.com/ Science Fiction & Fantasy Stackexchange] (posted 19 February 2012)</ref>
**He may be [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] as he wears a ruff and looks like he was of aristocratic status before his death.
**He may also looks similar to the [[Fat Friar]], being round and jolly, but the Fat Friar wears a monk's robe, and is a monk rather than a lord.
**Given his appearance, he may be the [[portly ghost]] that attended [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|Sir Nick's Death Day Party]]  on [[31 October]] [[1992]].
**He may be another unspecified ghost from the [[Harry Potter (book series)|series]] or simply invented by the illustrator [[Giles Greenfield]] for decorative purposes.
*In earlier sketches done by illustrator for this scene, there was originally no ghost present<ref>[https://youtu.be/5jutbSnxXxs?t=236 GILES GREENFIELD'S HARRY POTTER SKETCHBOOK | GOBLET OF FIRE ILLUSTRATOR] (3m58s) from [https://www.harrypottercollector.com/ The Potter Collector]</ref>, but he was added subsequently in more finished sketches, although his depiction trended towards even more portly.<ref>{{GOF}} - back cover sketch {{see image|File:Goblet-of-fire-back-cover-sketch-giles-greenfield.jpg}}</ref>
