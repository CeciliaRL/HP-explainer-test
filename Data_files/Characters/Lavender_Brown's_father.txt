'''Mr Brown''' was a [[pure-blood]]<ref name="HPM"/> [[Wizardkind|wizard]], husband of [[Lavender Brown's mother|Mrs Brown]] and father of [[Lavender Brown|Lavender]]. In [[1993]], he and his wife sent a letter to Lavender, informing her that her pet [[rabbit]] [[Binky]] had been killed by a [[fox]].<ref name="POA8">{{POA|B|8}}</ref>

Prior to that school year, either Mr Brown or his wife signed a [[Hogsmeade permission form]] for Lavender.<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}}</ref>

On [[2 May]], [[1998]], his daughter died during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] when she was attacked by [[Fenrir Greyback]].<ref name="PageToScreen">{{HPPS}}, page 215 - "Jessie Cave was also happy to come back, even knowing that Lavender Brown wasn't going to survive the final film. "She's not very lucky," the actress understates. "She doesn't meet a nice ending. She gets eaten by Fenrir Greyback. Cave recalls her death scene, which took several nights of shooting. "I had the most amazing prosthetic of a scar that looks so scary, it looked like I was actually mauled to death." </ref>
