{{Quote|...there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related.... A pity.... that the same cannot be said for you. ''‘Parents professions: greengrocers’''.|[[Dolores Umbridge]] during [[Mary Cattermole]]'s trial|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
The '''father''' of [[Mary Cattermole]] was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[greengrocer]], as was his [[Mary Cattermole's mother|wife]].<ref name="DH13"/>

Their daughter was a [[Muggle-born]] witch who eventually married [[Reginald Cattermole]] and had three children. Her [[blood status]] caused her trial with the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]] in [[1997]], when [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] infiltrated the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. On her questionnaire, she mentioned her parents' professions, which was inadvisable, as it made it extremely obvious to the unsympathetic regime at the time that she had no blood ancestry. Fortunately, [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], who were all in disguise, saved Mary from going to prison and advised her to flee the country.<ref name="DH13">{{DH|B|13}}</ref>
