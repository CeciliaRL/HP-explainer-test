'''Professor Bartholomew''' was the [[Potions Master]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] at some point between the 15th and 19th centuries.

He wrote his discoveries about the Vaults on his [[Beaker of Bartholomew|beaker]] in [[Rune|ancient runes]], and left it behind in the [[Potions Classroom]] in the hopes that those who came after would find it and continue his work.<ref name="Y3SQ" />
