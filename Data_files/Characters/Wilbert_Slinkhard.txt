'''Wilbert Slinkhard''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who authored the book ''[[Defensive Magical Theory]]'', which was approved by the [[British Ministry of Magic]] as a suitable textbook for [[fifth year]] [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] classes.<ref name="OOTP9">{{OOTP|B|9}}</ref> Due to the peaceful approaches to confrontation Slinkhard advocated, [[Dolores Umbridge]] found his work useful in her classes during the [[1995-1996 school year]] due to the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry's]] paranoid view that the students were being trained in combat.<ref name="OOTP12">{{OOTP|B|12}}</ref><ref name="OOTP15">{{OOTP|B|15}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|He says that counterjinxes are improperly named. He says ‘counterjinx’ is just a name people give their jinxes when they want to make them sound more acceptable.|Slinkhard's negative attitude towards defensive spells|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
If the contents of his masterwork are any indication of his personality or views on the subject, Slinkhard was a pacifist, advocating a passive approach to confrontation and discouraging the use of combative spells for even defensive purposes.<ref name="OOTP12"/><ref name="OOTP15"/> He deemed "[[counter-jinx]]" an inappropriate term to use for the spells, stating that such was only to make them seem more acceptable.<ref name="OOTP15"/> However, Slinkhard appeared to have had very little knowledge on how to adequately defend oneself, and his book was of very little education value to students studying [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], as it failed to teach in any way how to [[Duelling|duel]] or how to defend oneself against the [[Dark Arts]] or [[Dark Wizard]]s.<ref name="OOTP12"/><ref name="OOTP15"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Wilbert" means "bright will", derived from the Germanic elements wil "will, desire" and beraht "bright".
