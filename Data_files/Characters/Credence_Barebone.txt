'''Credence Barebone''' (allegedly born '''Aurelius Dumbledore''';<ref name="COG 120"/> c. [[1901]])<ref name="birth" /> was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who lived during the [[20th century]]. He was adopted by [[Mary Lou Barebone]], the leader of a [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] anti-[[Magic|witchcraft]] group called the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]]. Due to the repression of his [[magic]], Credence developed a [[Dark Arts|dark]] parasitic force known as an [[Obscurus]] and became an [[Obscurial]]. While most Obscurials die before their tenth birthday, Credence lived into adulthood, which was previously unheard of in the [[wizarding world]], and a testament of his incredible power. 

Credence was sought after by [[Gellert Grindelwald]], who wanted to use his power to kill [[Albus Dumbledore]], who he saw as the greatest threat to his [[Global wizarding war|revolutionary cause]]. While in search of his true identity, Credence heeded Grindelwald's call and joined [[Alliance|his army]].

==Biography==
===Early life (1901–1905)===
{{Quote|A son cruelly banished<br/>Despair of the daughter<br/>Return, great avenger<br/>With wings from the water.|A prophecy regarding Credence, from ''[[The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus]]''|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}

[[File:Young Leta Lestrange with infant Aurelius in her arms.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Young Leta Lestrange with infant Aurelius in her arms]]
Credence Barebone was born around [[1901]],<ref name="birth" /> allegedly to the [[Dumbledore family]], as Aurelius Dumbledore, according to [[Gellert Grindelwald]]<ref name="COG 120"/> ([[Percival Dumbledore]] and [[Kendra Dumbledore]] were both already long dead by this point).  

In [[1901]], Credence was taken by [[Credence Barebone's aunt|his aunt]] on a [[Unidentified ship|ship]] heading to America. He was switched in the crib by a young [[Leta Lestrange]] for her half-brother [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus]] because he was crying.<ref>{{COG|S|105}}</ref> The ship later sank during a storm and Credence was taken by Leta and [[Irma Dugard]] to a lifeboat. Their lifeboat sailed to safety, but the lifeboat his aunt and Corvus took capsized, drowning them both. Baby Credence was taken to [[United States of America|America]] and put up for adoption in Corvus's place, unbeknownst to anyone but Leta.<ref>{{COG|S|109}}</ref>

===Adopted (1905–1926)===
{{Quote|His name's Credence. His mother beats him. She beats all those kids she adopted, but she seems to hate him the most.|[[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] regarding Credence's adoptive family life|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:Barebone family.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Credence with his adopted family]]
On [[21 October]] [[1905]],<ref name="birth" /> he was adopted by [[Mary Lou Barebone]], an American [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] woman who led the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]], a hardline anti-[[magic|witchcraft]] group.<ref name="FB88">{{FB|S|88}}</ref> She renamed him Credence [[Barebone family|Barebone]], raising him in [[New York]] alongside her two other adopted children, [[Chastity Barebone|Chastity]] and [[Modesty Barebone|Modesty]]. Credence was the eldest of the three.

Whilst under Mary Lou's care, Credence was physically and mentally abused by her who attempted to suppress his magical abilities. She often used his own belt that left marks on his hands. The frequent abuse would cause him to become an [[Obscurial]].

Mary Lou considered Credence's [[Credence Barebone's mother|birth mother]] to be a "''wicked, unnatural woman''", suggesting that she was aware of his heritage.<ref name="FB88" />

During one meeting, Mary Lou was physically abusing Credence but was magically assaulted by [[Auror]] [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]]. The open use of magic in front of a group of [[non-magic people]] required extensive [[Memory Charm|Obliviation]] and was a major scandal resulting in Porpentina's demotion to the [[Wand Permit Office]].

===Global wizarding war (1926–1927)===
====Meeting Gellert Grindelwald====
{{Quote|My vision showed only the child’s immense power. He or she is no older than ten, and I saw this child in close proximity to your mother—she I saw so plainly.|Gellert Grindelwald explaining his vision to Credence|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
By December [[1926]], Credence was losing control of his [[Obscurus]], and it manifested in outbursts that were wreaking havoc in [[New York]]. These disturbances were noted both in the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] press such as the "[[New-York Clarion]]" and the wizarding press such as "[[The New York Ghost]]".<ref>{{FB|F}} {{see image|File:NewYorkGhost-6December1926.jpg}}</ref>

[[File:Credence and Grindelwald disguised as Graves.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Credence meets in secret with Gellert Grindelwald, who's disguised as auror Percival Graves]]
During that time, Credence came in regular contact with [[Gellert Grindelwald]], who was assuming the identity of [[Percival Graves]]. Grindelwald seduced Credence into tracking down an Obscurial that he had seen prior due to a [[vision]] he had received, as he believed Credence to be connected to it somehow. In exchange, Credence was promised to be made free and taught wizardry.

On [[6 December]], after a failed attempt by the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society|Second Salemers]] to garnish the support of [[Henry Shaw Senior]] and being insulted by his [[Henry Shaw Junior|son]] the senator, Credence's Obscurus manifested later that night and attacked a [[Fundraising Dinner for the Re-election of Senator Henry Shaw|fund-raising dinner]] at City Hall, killing the senator as a result. This act unwittingly exposed the wizarding world.

====Obscurial attack on New York City====
{{Dialogue|Gellert Grindelwald|You can control it, Credence.|Credence Barebone|But I don’t think I want to, Mr Graves.|Grindelwald argues with Credence's to control his Obscurus|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:Modesty and Credence.jpg|250px|thumb|Credence confronting his younger adopted sister Modesty in connection with the toy wand she has been hiding]]
The next day, Credence found a [[Modesty Barebone's wand|toy wand]] in [[Modesty Barebone|Modesty's]] bedroom. Mary Lou immediately concluded that the wand belonged to Credence when she entered the scene, despite Modesty claiming it to be hers. As she prepared to beat him yet again, Credence's Obscurus burst free. The dark force killed Mary Lou and [[Chastity Barebone|Chastity]], also causing heavy damage to the house.

Still in the form of Graves, Grindelwald arrived at the remains of the [[Second Salem Church]] and urged Credence to bring him to Modesty who had fled the destruction to her [[The Bronx|old childhood home]], since Grindelwald now believed that she is the child that he foresaw.

[[File:Credence's eyes turning white.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Credence's eyes turning white as he unleashed his Obscurus]]
Once there, Grindelwald told Credence that he had no further use for him and dismissed Credence as being a [[Squib]], despite his promises. This betrayal caused Credence to reveal his Obscurus, to the surprise of Grindelwald. Although Grindelwald attempted to apologise and offered to train him, Credence willingly let loose, transformed completely into an Obscurus and went on a [[Obscurial attack on New York|mindless rampage of destruction]] through [[New York]].<ref name="FB88" />

====Apparent death====
{{Quote|We see Credence from within the black mass, his face contorted, screaming. The barrage of spells continues and Credence howls in pain... Under this pressure, the Obscurus finally seems to implode — a white ball of magical light taking over from the black mass... All power subsides. Only small pieces of black matter are left — floating through the air like feathers.|Credence supposedly dies at the hands of MACUSA Aurors|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:Credence apparent death.gif|250px|thumb|Credence supposedly dies at the hands of MACUSA Aurors]]
Pursuing him to the [[New York City Subway|subway station]], [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] managed to calm Credence down only to engage in a battle with the treacherous dark wizard before the [[Magizoologist]] could gain his attention. Provoked by the fight, Credence resumed his Obscurial form, though [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina]] managed to get him to stop once more.

Rapported by the attack, [[Seraphina Picquery]] and [[Auror]]s from [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] arrived at the scene and proceeded to attack him with many [[spell]]s, only stopping when they believed he was destroyed. However, a single shred of his Obscurus form fled the scene, unseen to anyone but Newt.

This attack resulted in Grindelwald's capture and the believed destruction of Credence. Ultimately, thousands of [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]]s were [[Memory Charm|obliviated]] in order to protect wizarding secrecy.

====Reborn====
[[File:Credence reborn.gif|250px|thumb|right|Credence Reborn]]
Without everyone's knowledge, except Newt, Credence turned out to have survived, because an Obscurial cannot be killed while in their Obscurus state. Credence, as a single shred, fled away from the subway station to the destroyed [[Second Salem Church]]. When all shreds of his Obscurus connected together, Credence returned to his human form. He desperately searched the collapsed building until he finally found what he was looking for: his [[Credence Barebone's adoption certificate|adoption papers]].

====Looking for his identity====
[[File:Circus Arcanus leaving New York.gif|250px|thumb|left|Credence leaving New York and joining the Circus]]
Sometime after finding the document he joined the [[Circus Arcanus]], a travelling wizarding [[circus]] owned by the cruel ringmaster, [[Skender]]. Together with the whole crew, he sailed on the [[SS Ondine|SS. ONDINE]] to [[Europe]] and ended settling in [[Paris]].

During his time in Europe, Credence befriended a [[Maledictus]] named [[Nagini]], with whom he seemed to have a close relationship.

Six months after the events in New York, Gellert Grindelwald escaped during his transfer to Europe and three months after that he also journeyed to Paris in search for Credence, in order to utilise his abilities to kill [[Albus Dumbledore]].

Rumours surrounding Credence's identity began to circulate. [[Yusuf Kama]] believed he was [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus Lestrange V]], the son of [[Corvus Lestrange (IV)|Corvus Lestrange IV]] who [[Imperius Curse|Imperiused]] [[Laurena Kama|Kama's mother]] into marriage. Kama had made an [[Unbreakable Vow]] on his [[Mustafa Kama|father]]'s deathbed to kill who Corvus IV loved most, which he believed to be Corvus V.

====On the run with Nagini====
[[File:Credence and Nagini at Circus Arcanus.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Credence and Nagini plotting their escape from Circus Arcanus]]
Having had enough with their mistreatment, Credence and Nagini plotted their escape from the [[Circus Arcanus]], where both Kama and [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] had located him. Credence managed their getaway by releasing several of the beasts and fleeing in the ensuing chaos.

[[File:Credence and Irma.jpg|250px|thumb|Credence meets the half-elf servant of the Lestrange Family, Irma Dugard]]
Following this, Credence hid with Nagini at [[18 Rue Philippe Lorand]], being followed by [[Gunnar Grimmson]], the bounty hunter. At that location Credence found [[Irma Dugard]], the [[Irma Dugard|half-elf]], whom he believed to be his mother, as her name was on his adoption papers. Dugard revealed that she did not want to give him up, and noted that she was merely a servant to the [[Lestrange family|Lestrange]] household.

After a brief moment of tenderness, Grimmson trapped Nagini in the wall to [[Killing Curse|kill]] Irma on Grindelwald's orders to keep Credence's identity a secret from him. The Obscurus manifested and Credence attempted to kill Grimmson, but failed to do so.

[[File:Grindelwald giving Credence the Cimetière du Père-Lachaise map.gif|250px|thumb|left|Credence and Nagini talking with Grindelwald]]
After that, Credence and Nagini were hiding in the house near the [[Eiffel Tower]], where Barebone was caring for a chick. Grindelwald tracked him down and offered him a chance to find out his true parentage. Credence, ready to learn the truth, accepted the map to the [[Cimetière du Père-Lachaise|Pere Lachaise Cemetery]] given by the Dark Wizard.

[[File:Credence and Nagini at the Lestrange Mausoleum.jpg|250px|thumb|Credence and Nagini in the Lestrange Mausoleum]]
At the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]], Credence and Nagini crossed paths with Kama and [[Jacob Kowalski]]. Kama, believing that Credence was Corvus, prepared to kill him, but they were joined by Newt Scamander, [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] and [[Leta Lestrange]], Kama's half-sister. Leta insisted that Credence was not her half-brother, as the real Corvus Lestrange died. Leta recounted her father sending her and her brother to America on a ship. Wanting to relieve herself of her screaming brother, Leta swapped him with another baby on the ship, that baby being Credence. The ship sank before Leta could switch the babies back, and the real Corvus Lestrange drowned.

====Joining Grindelwald====
[[File:Credence joining Grindelwald.gif|250px|thumb|left|Credence joining Grindelwald's forces]]
After Leta's confession, Credence and others attended Grindelwald's rally, which ended in the Aurors storming against the host. Grindelwald created a [[Protego Diabolica|circle of blue flames]], an enchantment designed to test the loyalty of his followers: those who enter with complete fidelity shall survive; those who do not, perish. Against Nagini's insistence, Credence entered the circle and joined Grindelwald, trusting that he had knowledge of his true identity. 

[[File:Credence testing his wand.gif|250px|thumb|Credence testing his wand in [[Nurmengard Castle|Nurmengard]]]]
Sometime later, at [[Nurmengard Castle|Nurmengard]] in [[Austria]], Grindelwald revealed to Credence that the baby bird he has been caring for was actually a [[phoenix]]. According to legend, a phoenix will appear to anyone of the Dumbledore Family in dire need. Grindelwald then presented him with a [[Credence Barebone's wand|wand]], as well as his alleged birth name: Aurelius Dumbledore. Credence was shocked at what he had just been told, and when Grindelwald left Credence alone to ponder over his new life, Credence gestured with his wand, sending a ball of light crashing through a window and then into a mountainside, causing it to collapse. Credence was left in sheer awe at the discovery of his magical prowess.<ref name="COG 120" />

Sometime in the [[1930s]], Credence met [[Albus Dumbledore]] on a [[Berlin street|street]] in [[Berlin]] and had a showdown.<ref>[https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/ADL8786674965?selected=ADL8952094054/ S6 EPISODE 1: ABSOLUTELY ALBUS WITH JUDE LAW!]</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue|David Heyman|Credence is someone who doesn’t really have a sense of who he is, and is suffering from low self-esteem.

[[File:Credence Joining Grindelwald.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Credence joining Grindelwald despite Nagini's protests]]
Credence was described as "troubled" and "mysterious".<ref name="entertainmentweekly1">[http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-characters/2368598_ezra-miller-credence 'Fantastic Beasts' Character Descriptions Revealed] at [http://www.ew.com/ EW.com]</ref><ref name="pottermore-everything">[https://www.pottermore.com/news/everything-we-have-learned-about-fantastic-beasts "Everything we've learned about ‘Fantastic Beasts' this week"] from {{PM}}</ref> Shy and withdrawn, this made him far more vulnerable to the abuse that came in response to the slightest infraction of his adoptive mother's strict rules. His timid personality also made him susceptible to manipulation by [[Gellert Grindelwald]], who took a personal interest in him.<ref name="EW2016-08-10">[http://www.ew.com/article/2016/08/10/fantastic-beasts-ezra-miller "''Fantastic Beasts'': First look at Ezra Miller's mysterious character"] at [http://www.ew.com/ Entertainment Weekly]</ref>

However, when he was insulted or threatened, Credence's [[Obscurus]] form was unleashed. This Obscurus form was triggered by his negative emotions and experiences, and therefore was induced by them to act violently. This caused widespread destruction and death to those who provoked Credence. Namely, he attacked [[Mary Lou Barebone]] because of the abuse the latter inflicted on him for so long, and [[Henry Shaw Junior]] for the way the arrogant [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] politician had mocked him.

After being nearly killed by over 20 [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] Aurors on the orders of [[Seraphina Picquery|President Picquery]], Credence became embittered towards most of the magical community, and, desperate to survive, and learn his true heritage, he joined the [[Circus Arcanus]], and befriended fellow outcast [[Nagini]]. However, Grindelwald was once again able to manipulate Credence - taking advantage of the youth's desire to learn of his true heritage, Grindelwald convinced Credence to join [[Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes|his acolytes]], convincing Credence so effectively that even Nagini was unable to dissuade him. After finally being given [[Credence Barebone's wand|a wand]] by his new master at [[Nurmengard Castle]], Credence accepted his true heritage as Aurelius Dumbledore, and seemingly agreed to help Grindelwald bypass the blood pact and kill [[Albus Dumbledore]].

==Magical abilities and skills==

*'''[[Obscurus]] [[Transformation]]''': Credence was an Obscurial, prone to unleashing or embodying an Obscurus due to years of being forced to suppress his magic. He was immensely more powerful than other known Obscurials, living longer than any previously known, and requiring over 20 [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] Aurors unleashing destructive spells to nearly destroy Credence, though he still managed to survive. Ever since then, Credence had acquired complete control over his Obscurus, being far more precise with his Obscurus attacks than before while fighting [[Gunnar Grimmson]], with the [[bounty hunter]] being forced to constantly hold up a [[Shield Charm]], and Apparate away to safety. [[Gellert Grindelwald]] went so far as to claim to [[Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes|his acolytes]] that Credence's Obscurus was the only being apart from himself powerful enough to defeat and kill [[Albus Dumbledore]], the so-called greatest wizard of all time, marking him the most powerful Obscurial to have ever existed.
*'''[[Magic]]al aptitude''': While Credence had not initially developed his magical abilities due to [[Mary Lou Barebone]], his latent magical powers were incredible, which allowed him to survive long past the age of 10, despite having an [[Obscurus]] inside him. This was possibly due to Credence being an alleged member of the [[Dumbledore family]]. After being given a wand for the first time, Credence instinctively cast a spell that fired a bolt of fiery energy so powerful that it instantly destroyed a mountainside.
*'''[[Credence Barebone's wand|Wand]] versatility''': Credence was able to effectively use the wand gifted to him by Grindelwald, without having been officially chosen by said wand, and Credence was even able to instinctively cast an extremely powerful spell from that wand, pulverising a mountainside.
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Although where he learned how to Apparate was unknown (though possibly during the travels that led to him joining the [[Circus Arcanus]]), Credence was able to Apparate away from Grindelwald's rally in [[Paris]].

==Possessions==
[[File:Credence Barebone's wand COG.jpg|150px|thumb|Credence's wand]]
*'''[[Credence Barebone's belt|Belt]]''': This leather belt owned by Credence was used by his cruel adoptive mother [[Mary Lou Barebone]] to corporally punish him whenever he displeased her.
*'''[[Credence Barebone's phoenix|Phoenix]]''': At [[Nurmengard Castle]], the baby Phoenix that he had been caring for approached Credence again (now revealed to be possibly Aurelius Dumbledore), possibly fulfilling the [[Dumbledore family]] legend of a Phoenix coming to any Dumbledore who was in desperate need.<ref name="COG 120"/>
*'''[[Credence Barebone's wand|Wand]]''': After joining Grindelwald's army, Credence was given a wand by his new master.<ref name="COG 118"/>

==Relationships==
===[[Dumbledore family]]===
====[[Albus Dumbledore]]====
{{Quote|And yet Scamander appears wherever the Obscurial goes, to protect him.|Travers questioning why Dumbledore sends Newt abroad|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:YoungAlbusDumbledore2.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Albus Dumbledore]], seemingly his half-brother]]
Albus Dumbledore developed an interest in Credence and worked with his former student, Newton Scamander, twice in order to protect him from Gellert Grindelwald. It was unknown though, if Albus was aware that the Obscurial he wanted to protect was possibly a lost member of his family. Though Grindelwald claimed that Credence was Aurelius Dumbledore, Albus' younger brother, this seemed unlikely as Albus' parents had both died before Credence was born. Later on, Credence agreed to help Grindelwald bypass the Dark Wizard's blood pact and kill Albus.

===[[Irma Dugard]]===
[[File:Irma Dugard.png|200px|thumb|Irma Dugard, his caretaker]]
{{Quote|You were such a beautiful baby. And you are a beautiful man. I have missed you.|Irma Dugard to Credence|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}
Unknown to Mary Lou Barebone, the woman she believed to be Credence's mother was in fact the [[Part elf|Half-elf]] servant of the [[Lestrange family]], Irma Dugard. Dugard unknowingly ended up with Aurelius after the young [[Leta Lestrange]] switched him with her baby brother [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus Lestrange]]. Irma later took care of the young Credence, signing his adoption paper and handing him over in the care of Mary Lou Barebone.

===[[Mary Lou Barebone]]===
{{Quote|As if on autopilot, Credence removes his belt. Mary Lou stands and extends her hand, taking the belt. In silence, she turns and walks up the stairs—Credence obediently following.|Mary Lou punishes Credence for coming home late|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:Mary Lou Barebone FBF.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Mary Lou Barebone, his abusive adoptive mother]]
Credence feared his adoptive mother due to years of emotional and physical abuse. She beat him with the intent of teaching him to suppress and be ashamed of his magical traits. By suppressing his [[magic]], he developed an Obscurus. It was noted by [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] that out of all Mary Lou's adopted children, Credence was the most hated.

Credence learned over the years to willingly surrender his belt for a beating when he knew he did something wrong. He tended to be passive when it came to the beatings and he learned to take them submissively. Despite living in an environment where magic was shunned, Credence was drawn toward the ideas of wizardry and even entertained the thought of becoming part of the [[wizarding world]]. Mary Lou seemed to be aware of Credence's interest in magic and did not hesitate to beat him for it. When Mary Lou was about to attack Credence, he transformed into his Obscurus form and killed her. 

===[[Modesty Barebone]]===
{{Quote|Behind Credence, Modesty’s eyes burn. She clutches Credence’s hand protectively.|Modesty took Credence's hand after he was insulted by Senator Shaw| Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:FBaWtFT promo Modesty Barebone.jpg.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Modesty Barebone]], his younger adopted sister]]
Modesty was kind to her older foster brother and he was close to her as a result. One of the reasons Credence shared a close relationship with Modesty, was because she did not possess the same zealous attitude [[Chastity Barebone|Chastity]] did in regards to their adoptive mother's anti-witchcraft stance.

Modesty was young and curious, she shared Credence's secret interest in [[magic]]. Because of this shared interest, they trusted each other. When [[Henry Shaw Junior]] meanly insulted Credence, she took his hand to reassure him. Modesty often witnessed the beatings he got from their mother and comforted him.

Modesty occasionally confided in Credence that she missed the nine brothers and sisters she had before she was adopted. When Credence found the toy wand under Modesty's bed, [[Mary Lou Barebone|Mary Lou]] believed it to be his and beat him, despite Modesty's attempt at convincing her it was hers. This shows that she defended him when he was about to be whipped by their foster mother. After the Obscurus took control of Credence and killed their adopted family, she became fearful of him. Despite her immense fear of him, he showed no anger towards her and did not try to harm her, as she had been one of the few people in the world who had ever showed him any kindness, which he clearly respected her for. 

===[[Nagini]]===
{{Quote|He knows what you were born, not who you are...|Nagini showing her love for Credence, trying to stop him from joining Grindelwald|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:Nagini human.jpeg|200px|thumb|left|Nagini, his closest and only friend]]
During his time at Circus Arcanus, Credence befriended fellow outcast Nagini. These two broken souls quickly developed a close relationship, due to their similarly tragic pasts. Nagini is Credence's only friend. After they escaped the Circus together, and wishing to stay together, Nagini assisted Credence on his quest to find out his true identity. At the time, Nagini became very caring and protective of Credence. An example of this is when she comforted him with a hug after they witnessed Irma Dugard's death, and refused to step aside when Yusuf Kama was at the point of killing Credence. Despite his friend begging him to stay with her, Credence joined Grindelwald's army in the end, leaving Nagini devastated and heartbroken afterwards. However, Nagini's devastation over losing Credence induced her to officially join the [[Global Wizarding War]] against Grindelwald.

[[File:Grindelwald-Profile-0.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gellert Grindelwald]], his former friend, turned enemy, turned master]]
Grindelwald disguised himself as [[Percival Graves]], and used Credence to try and locate the [[Obscurial]] terrorising [[New York]], whom he believed was [[Modesty Barebone]], promising him entrance into the wizarding world and training to perform magic. To Credence, "Percival Graves" was his only friend, and the only person who truly understood and supported him. "Mr Graves" thus healed Credence's hands, and comforted the youth when Credence confided in him about his mother's mistreatment.

After the [[Obscurus]] attacked Mary Lou, "Mr Graves" told Credence he had no use for him, calling him a Squib, and pursued Modesty. Because of the emotional strain, Credence lost control over the Obscurus and, after "Mr Graves" realised it was him, offered his partnership and training in wizardry. Credence was deeply hurt by his manipulation, and angrily fled, now seeing Grindelwald as what he truly was. MACUSA's Aurors chased and attacked him, and when Newt and Tina attempted to calm him and protect him, Grindelwald interrupted them to provoke Credence to cause more destruction in the hopes of achieving a war between magical and non-magical people. Despite how he had earlier coldly dismissed Credence, it appeared that after Credence's magical heritage and power was revealed, Grindelwald considered him to have been unjustly treated by his mother and later the whole MACUSA, as he showed genuine emotions of rage when MACUSA destroyed Credence and later showed a level of pity when referring to how Mary Lou Barebone had nearly destroyed Credence.

It was revealed one year later that Grindelwald was so desperate to gain the New York Obscurial's allegiance because he believed that this was the only way for him to kill [[Albus Dumbledore]] without violating the blood pact, as Grindelwald believed that the Obscurial was the only wizard other than himself powerful enough to kill Dumbledore. As such, Grindelwald remains desperate to sway Credence to his side, promising to reveal the youth's true name and heritage to him. Ultimately, the desire to be his true self was too much for Credence to resist, so he joined [[Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes|Grindelwald's acolytes]] at the [[Lestrange Mausoleum|Lestrange family Mausoleum]]. Credence readily accepted "Aurelius Dumbledore" as his true name, as well as Grindelwald's gifts of [[Credence Barebone's wand|a wand]] and a [[Phoenix]], as well as seemingly agreeing to help Grindelwald kill Albus Dumbledore.

==Etymology==
*Credence is derived from the Latin ''credere'', meaning to trust and to believe, and from ''credentia, ''meaning belief.<ref>[http://appellationmountain.net/credence-baby-name-of-the-day/ Etymology - Credence]</ref> 
*Barebone is an Anglo-Saxon surname, thought to be taken from the name of an English village, Barbon or Barbourne.<ref>[https://www.houseofnames.com/barebone-family-crest House of Names - Barebone Family]</ref> 
**It is also the surname of two notable Puritans, Praise-God Barebone<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praise-God_Barebone</ref> and his son Nicholas Barbon.<ref>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Barbon</ref> The former gave his name to the Barebone's Parliament, predecessor of Oliver Cromwell's Protectorate, while the latter was one of the first proponents of a free market and, after the Great Fire of London, helped to pioneer fire insurance was a leading player of the following reconstruction work.
**Something described as "barebones" is "reduced to or comprising only the basic or essential elements of something."
*On the other hand, Credence's alleged birth name Aurelius is derived from Latin ''aureus'', meaning golden and gilded. {{wplink|Marcus Aurelius}} was a 2nd-century philosophical writer and Roman emperor. Aurelius was too the name of several early saints, such as {{wplink|Saint Aurelius}}.<ref>[https://www.behindthename.com/name/aurelius Etymology - Aurelius]</ref>

*Credence is portrayed by [[Ezra Miller]] in {{FB|FHF}} and {{COG}}.<ref name="businesswire">"[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150817005158/en/Filming-Underway-%E2%80%9CFantastic-Beasts-Find-Them%E2%80%9D#.VdHvhpfMLo1 Filming Gets Underway on «Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them»]" at [http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/ BusinessWire]</ref>
*Initial reports said this character's name was "Kredan".<ref name="variety">[http://variety.com/2015/film/news/ezra-miller-eyes-harry-potter-spinoff-fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-exclusive-1201527280/ "Ezra Miller Eyes ‘Harry Potter’ Spinoff ‘Fantastic Beasts’ (EXCLUSIVE)"] at [http://variety.com/ Variety.com]</ref> When asked about it via Twitter, [[J. K. Rowling]] said, "Kredan is quite literally nobody. They got the name wrong!"<ref name="Twitter">[https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/619563964469522433 .@KeridoAvada Kredan is quite literally nobody.

*Although initially thought to be Corvus Lestrange by some characters such as Yusuf Kama, this was proven incorrect when Leta Lestrange admitted she had swapped Corvus for another baby, resulting in Corvus's death and the other unknown baby (Credence) surviving.
*According to the screenplay Credence should be born in 1901. However, his adoption certificate says 1904. But it could be possible that Irma falsified the birthday to further conceal him from Yusuf Kama if the latter should ever try to look for his target in America by searching for a boy born in 1901.
*Though Credence is said to be Albus's "brother" by Grindelwald, it is notable that the timeline doesn't fit if indeed Grindelwald is telling the truth. Kendra Dumbledore died in 1899, some two years before his birth (if referring to the screenplay) or five to six years before his birth (if going by the adoption certificate).<ref>See [[:file:Credence Barebone's Adoption Certificate.jpg|this image]].</ref> Percival Dumbledore died in Azkaban after his imprisonment, but it's unknown when he died. It's unknown if Rowling plans to give new details about Percival's life.
**It is possible, however, that Grindelwald meant the word as "kinsman", and that Aurelius is a close relative of Albus, possibly the son of Albus' aunt [[Honoria]], though if speaking more euphemistically "cousin" would be both accurate and more generally applicable.
*There is a deleted scene in {{COG}} in which, immediately after [[Credence Barebone]]'s presumed destruction at the hands of [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] in {{FB|F}}, he travels slowly back to the [[Second Salem Church]] and finds his wet and destroyed birth certificate.<ref>[https://youtu.be/46bKThktjnw/ Credence reborn - Fantastic Beasts: Crimes of Grindelwald]</ref>
