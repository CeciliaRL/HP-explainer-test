{{Quote|You journey to India with the one-named Celebrity Magizoologist Naasz to find a Phoenix in the wild. Your patience is tested by endless interviews and relentless ego.|Description|Harry Potter: Wizards Unite}}
'''Naasz''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and celebrity [[Magizoologist]], noted for her relentless ego. She always wanted to be a headmistress and so she opened the unaccredited Naaszcademy of Magizoology in Brussels.<ref name="WU">{{WU}} ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCIfSWgMX-c see video])</ref>

==Biography==
In the [[2010s]], Naasz took members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] who pursued a [[Magizoologist]] profession on a journey to [[India]] to find a wild [[Phoenix]] in its natural habitat. The experience of it, however, ended up being a test of patience due to the endless interviews they agreed to give, and her egotistical demeanour.<ref name="WU"/>

Naasz once tricked a [[Calamity Investigator]] into transporting her store of personally-designed (and almost completely useless) magical artefacts to the Ministry of Magic for safekeeping. At one point she created or obtained a trinket described as a "green-dyed Hippogriff feather with tiny baubles hanging equidistantly around the spine." It was sent to a member of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, who thought it looked like a rather cheap souvenir. Naasz insisted that it was a valuable artefact, and carrying it seemed to increase the Task Force volunteer's chances of keeping a Magizoological Trace in their sights.<ref name="WU" />

In America, Naasz performed a one-woman, wordless stage play titled '''The Calamitous Calamity''<nowiki/>'. It was emotionally stirring. She also hosted a relentless and sophomoric lecture about theoretical magic regarding harmonic attuning and energy.<ref name="WU" />

Naasz once attempted to sell her own blend of tea, but the taste was revolting. She was convinced to sell it as a solvent instead, to the relief of teashop owners.<ref name="WU" />

She once released a long-winded 21-page pamphlet detailing techniques for handling creatures commonly deployed by the Calamity as Confoundables, but only four things within were actually useful. Naasz also opened a school in Brussels on a whim, desiring the position of headmistress. It had no faculty or staff.<ref name="WU" />
