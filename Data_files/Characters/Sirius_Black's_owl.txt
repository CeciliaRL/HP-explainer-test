{{Quote|P.S.: the [[bird]] bites.|[[Sirius Black]].|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)}}
This was a '''black [[owl]]''' that belonged to [[Sirius Black]], which he sent to deliver a letter to [[Harry Potter]] in late [[1994]]. The owl had an unfortunate tendency of biting people, and was one of the many [[Tropical bird|exotic birds]] that Sirius used to deliver letters to Harry, as [[Hedwig]] was easily recognisable.<ref name="GOFF">{{GOF|F}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Director [[Mike Newell]] wanted a black owl, which simply do not exist. The animal grooming department used a non-toxic food colouring to actually paint a brown owl's feathers to create a black owl.<ref name="Ultimate Edition">''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: Ultimate Edition''</ref>
