'''Malecrit''' was a [[France|French]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who lived in the early [[15th century]]. 

==Biography==
A playwright, Malecrit wrote the ''[[Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré Les Pieds]]'', a play which included a reference to the game of [[Quidditch]], showing that the game had spread to [[France]] by the early [[1400s]].<ref>{{QTA|R|8}}</ref>

As reported by [[French]] wizarding newspaper ''[[Le Cri de la Gargouille]]'', in [[1927]], some unpublished works by Malecrit were found in a [[dragon]] cave.<ref>{{COG}} {{see image|File:Le Cri De La Gargouille.jpg}} - ''"Les œuvres inédites de MALECRIT trouvées dans la grotte des Dragons!"''</ref>

==Etymology==
"Malecrit" presumably derives from the French ''mal écrit'', which means "poorly written".
==Behind the scenes==
*Interestingly, despite the pun the name already contained, in the French translated edition, the name was altogether changed into "Forbien Narré" (pronounced ''fort bien narré'', which means "well narrated").
