'''Zara Valli''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Hufflepuff]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]]. On the [[2 September|first]] day of the [[1996–1997 school year]], she had to go to the [[Hogwarts Library|library]], in order to do research for a fifteen-inch essay she had to write for [[Charms (class)|Charms]]. She agreed to give [[Harry Potter]] some [[Moondew]] in exchange for two [[Gobstones]] while there. Later in the year, she could be found in the [[Viaduct]], where she traded Gobstones for [[potion]]s.<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}} - NDS version</ref>
