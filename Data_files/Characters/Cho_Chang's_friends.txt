As a [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] student, [[Cho Chang]] had a close circle of '''friends''' who were all fellow [[Ravenclaw]] girls, which included [[Marietta Edgecombe]]. They all gravitated to Cho because of her beauty and popularity, and could often be seen following Cho in a group around the school.<ref name="GOF22">{{GOF|B|22}}</ref>

==History==
During her time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], [[Cho Chang]] formed a group of friends among her fellow [[Ravenclaw]]s.<ref name="GOF22"/> [[Marietta Edgecombe]] was a known member of Cho's close friendship circle.<ref name="OOTP18"/> As the pretty and popular [[Seeker]] of the [[Ravenclaw Quidditch team]], Cho was the centre of the group.<ref name="GOF22"/>

In [[1994]], [[Harry Potter]] could not find Cho alone to ask her to the [[Yule Ball]] because she was always surrounded by at least four or five friends. When he finally asked her to speak with him privately, her friends all giggled, probably because they knew that he intended to ask her out.<ref name="GOF22"/>

However, Cho became depressed and began experiencing grief-induced mood swings following the [[Death|murder]] of her boyfriend [[Cedric Diggory]].<ref name="OOTP21">{{OOTP|B|21}}</ref> Her friends all abandoned her in her time of need except Marietta. The two stuck by each other throughout both the [[1995–1996 school year]]<ref name="OOTP18">{{OOTP|B|18}}</ref> and the [[1996–1997 school year]].<ref name="HBP7">{{HBP|B|7}}</ref>
