These two '''women''' were the older [[Squib]] sisters of [[Gilderoy Lockhart]].<ref name="PMGL">{{WW|gilderoy-lockhart}}</ref>

==Biography==
They are the daughters of [[Gilderoy Lockhart's father|Mr Lockhart]], a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]], and [[Gilderoy Lockhart's mother|Mrs Lockhart]], a [[Wizardkind|witch]]. Their mother doted on Gilderoy due to his [[magic]]al powers and treated him as her unashamed favourite, which implies she neglected her daughters to some degree; being Squibs may have influenced her thoughts on them, as squibs are commonly looked down on in the wizarding community.<ref name="PMGL"/>

The [[Healer]] who looked after [[Gilderoy Lockhart|Lockhart]], [[Miriam Strout]], stated in [[December]] [[1995]] that he never got visitors at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]].<ref name="OOTP23">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref> This could mean that Lockhart's sisters were either deceased by then, or simply did not wish to see their brother.

==Behind the scenes==
*It is rare for squibs, even one, to be born into a magical lineage.<ref name="squib">"[http://web.archive.org/web/20120208051328/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=19 Squibs]" at {{JKRS}} (Internet Archive)</ref> The fact that these two out of three Lockhart siblings are squibs is noteworthy.
