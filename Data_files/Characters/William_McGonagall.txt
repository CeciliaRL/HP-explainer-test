==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|William McGonagall is celebrated as the worst poet in British history. There was something irresistible to me about his name, and the idea that such a brilliant woman might be a distant relative of the buffoonish McGonagall.|[[J. K. Rowling]].|Pottermore}}
*[[Wikipedia:William McGonagall|William McGonagall]] was a real British poet, who lived in the nineteenth century. He is widely acclaimed as the worst poet in British history, based on his spontaneously amusing and inappropriate rhythms, weak vocabulary, poor scansions, and ill-advised imagery.
