'''Bean'''<ref name="q21">{{HM|3|Q2|1}}</ref> was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1980s]].

==Biography==
During her time at Hogwarts, she was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into an unknown [[Hogwarts Houses|House]]. At some point before or during the [[1985–1986 school year]], she became a [[Beater]] on her House [[Quidditch team]].<ref name="q11">{{HM|2|Q1|1}}</ref>

She talked to her [[Beater's bat|bat]] after [[Quidditch]] matches as her lucky tradition.<ref name="qc">{{HM|2|The Quidditch Cup}}</ref>

She was extremely dedicated to her position as a Beater to the point where she neglected her studies and had not attended any lessons after her second house match in the [[1985–1986 school year]]. As a result, during the [[1986–1987 school year]], she was suspended from her Quidditch team for the season and her position was filled by [[Jacob's sibling]].<ref name="q21" /> 

After the school year, she had improved her grades to the point that her suspension was lifted and she returned to play the position for at least the [[1987–1988 school year|next season]].<ref name="q213">{{HM|3|Q2|13}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==

*Her house is the same as that of [[Jacob's sibling]], which is chosen by the player.
*Bean is a fan of [[Erika Rath]].
