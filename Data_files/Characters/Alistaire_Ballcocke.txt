==Etymology==
''Ballcocke'' is an alternate spelling of the English surname ''Balcock'', which derives from the diminutive suffix -''cock'' combined with either ''Bald'', a pet form of the Germanic male given name ''Baldwin'', or the Old English ''beald'' ("brave," "bold").<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=DDF3mn8473wC&pg=PA161 ''A Dictionary of English Surnames''] by P. H. Reaney and R. M. Wilson</ref> 

A ballcock is a mechanism for filling water tanks (such as in flush toilets) designed to prevent overflow and backflow.<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballcock Ballcock]" on Wikipedia</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This character was presumably named after [[Alastair Bullock]], the assistant art director on {{POA|FA}}.
