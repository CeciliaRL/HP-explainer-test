'''Eduardo''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. According to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', he was not a [[pure-blood]] wizard as he had always pretended; he was not even a pure [[human]].<ref>See [[:File:Eduardo reference.jpg|this image]].</ref> However, as this article was written by [[Rita Skeeter]], this information can be taken with a grain of salt.

==Behind the scenes==
*This individual was only mentioned on a ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' prop in {{GOF|FA}}. The text on the prop appears to be a copy of the "DUMBLEDORE'S GIANT MISTAKE" article featured in the novel (chapter twenty-four), however, in the prop Rubeus Hagrid's name is replaced by "Eduardo", "he" and "him", and [[Draco Malfoy]]'s is replaced by "[[Mauricius]]".
*"Eduardo" is most likely a reference to [[Eduardo Lima]], graphic artist for the [[Harry Potter films|''Harry Potter'' films]] since ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''.
