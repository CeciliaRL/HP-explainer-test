{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a|Harry Potter|So who’ve you been beating up tonight? Another ten-year-old? I know you did [[Mark Evans]] two nights ago - |Dudley Dursley|He was asking for it.|Oh yeah?|He cheeked me.|Yeah? Did he say you look like a [[pig]] that’s been taught to walk on its hind legs? Cause that’s not cheek, Dud, that’s true ... |Harry denouncing Dudley and his gang for their bullying behaviour| Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
[[Dudley Dursley]] led a '''gang''', which was a group of bullies. Dudley was in charge by virtue of being the biggest, strongest, and (according to [[Harry Potter|Harry]]) stupidest of the lot of them.<ref name="PS3">{{PS|B|3}}</ref>

In [[1995]], the gang would roam the streets around [[Little Whinging]] harassing other people, such as by throwing stones at passing [[car]]s, or beating up young children.<ref name="OOTP1">{{OOTP|B|1}}</ref> They covered their actions by telling their parents they were going to another member of the gang's house for tea every night.<ref name="OOTP1"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, the gang were laughing at Harry who was being taunted by Dudley. They laugh even more when Harry pulls out [[Harry Potter's wand|his wand]] (as they are unaware it is [[magic]]al), and they flee in terror when the sky [[Attack in Little Whinging|becomes dark]]. Though all four of them appear in the film, only Piers and Malcolm are credited.
*In {{OOTP|FA}}, Harry makes a snide comment about the bravery of Dudley's gang. In {{HBP}}, [[Severus Snape]] makes a similar comment about [[James Potter I|James Potter]]'s [[Marauders|gang]].
