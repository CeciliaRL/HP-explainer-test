{{Quote|That lot from across the marsh have been at it again. Playing a stupid game on their broomsticks.|Translated excerpt from [[Gertie Keddle's diary]]|Quidditch Through the Ages (real)}}
'''Gertie Keddle''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived on the edge of [[Queerditch Marsh]] in the [[11th century]].<ref name="jkr-manchester" /><ref name="QTA3">{{QTA|R|3}}</ref>

==Biography==
A rather uneducated witch by wizarding standards of the time, Gertie kept a [[Gertie Keddle's diary|diary]] in "badly spelled" [[Saxon]], and only knew the name of one day of the week (Tuesday). In her diary, she chronicled the evolution of the ''"stupid game"'' the wizards from across the marsh played, that would later become [[Quidditch]]. She thought that the lot who played it, including her friend, [[Gwenog]], were idiots. Gertie also owned a [[cabbage]] patch in which a leather ball, presumably the first ever [[Quaffle]], landed.<ref name="QTA3"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*In 2017, in response to a [[Wikipedia:Twitter|tweet]] from the [[Wikipedia:QI|QI Elves]] saying that "''Quidditch, digestive biscuits and overdrafts were all invented in Edinburgh''", [[J. K. Rowling]] remarked that Quidditch was in actuality invented in [[Manchester]].<ref name="jkr-manchester2">[[England|J. K. Rowling]] on Twitter: [[11th century|"Untrue, I'm afraid! Quidditch was invented in Manchester."]]</ref> This is not a reference to the location of Queerditch Marsh, however, but the actual place in which Rowling came up with the idea of Quidditch — in a hand-signed, annotated first edition of {{PS}} that was auctioned for charity in 2013, Rowling remarked that she had invented Quidditch while staying in a small hotel in Manchester after a row with her then-boyfriend, adding rules that she was sure would infuriate men, which she found satisfying given her state of mind at the time.<ref>Furness, Hannah (18 May 2013).
