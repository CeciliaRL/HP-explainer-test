A '''Transylvanian farmer''' was supposedly cured of a [[Babbling Curse]] by [[Gilderoy Lockhart]]. However, it is far more likely that Lockhart either fabricated the incident up or simply took credit for it.<ref name="COS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref> In [[Harry Potter]]'s [[second year]] in [[1992]], Professor Lockhart chose Harry to help act out this incident during one of his [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] classes.<ref name="COS10">{{COS|B|10}}</ref>
