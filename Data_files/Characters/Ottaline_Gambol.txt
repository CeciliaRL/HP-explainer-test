'''Minister Ottaline Gambol''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Minister for Magic]] who was in office from [[1827]] to [[1835]]. Fascinated with [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] technology, she was "daring and controversial" and proposed the train as a solution to the age-old dilemma of how to transport hundreds of students to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] without attracting non-magic attention, leading to the creation of the [[Hogwarts Express]].<ref name="Pottermore">Hogwarts Express information on Pottermore (transcription available [http://welp-pottermore.tumblr.com/post/9147590569/the-hogwarts-express here])</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ottaline Gambol was born sometime prior to [[1810]], somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]], to at least one magical parent. It is likely she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in her youth.

===As Minister for Magic===
Ms. Gambol rose to the office of [[Minister for Magic]] in [[1827]] and proved to be effective in the solution of the problem of how to transport hundreds of students to and from [[Hogwarts Castle]] without attracting the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s' attention.<ref name="Pottermore" />

Gambol was elected Minister at least twice by the British and Irish Wizarding community.

[[Portkey]]s had been arranged at collecting points all over Britain and Ireland ever since the imposition of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|International Statute of Secrecy]] in [[1692]]. However, Portkeys proved not to be the ideal solution to the problem of school transportation (up to a third of students would fail to arrive every year, as well as many students were prone to [[Portkey-sickness]]). A return to the unregulated travel of the past was impossible, as well as other magical routes into the school (like the usage of [[Floo Powder]]) were strongly resisted by successive [[Headmaster]]s, who were concerned the security of the Castle would be breached.<ref name="Pottermore" />

Three years into her time in office, in [[1830]],<ref name="Act1Scene11">{{CC|B|1|11}}</ref> Minister Gambol made a daring and controversial suggestion to solve the problem: intrigued by the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] technology, the Minister saw the potential of using a train as a secure and comfortable alternative to [[Portkey]]s. Thus the [[Hogwarts Express]] came to be. Where the locomotive was actually obtained from remains unknown, but there are classified files at the [[British Ministry of Magic Headquarters|Ministry of Magic]] pertaining to [[Ministry of Magic operation to acquire the Hogwarts Express|a large-scale operation]] involving one hundred and sixty-seven [[Memory Charm]]s, as well as the biggest [[Concealment Charm]] ever performed in Britain. The morning after this operation, the residents of [[Hogsmeade]] awoke to find a [[Hogsmeade station|railway station]] that had not been there previously and Muggle railway employees in [[Crewe]] had the feeling they had misplaced something, which stayed with them for the rest of the year.<ref name="Pottermore" />

During her tenure around the year [[1830]] she hired the [[Trolley witch]] to both sell sweets and ensure all students arrived at Hogwarts.<ref name="Act1Scene11"/>

Gambol left office in [[1835]].
