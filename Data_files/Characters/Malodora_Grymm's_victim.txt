This '''girl''' was said to have been the most beautiful in the kingdom. After the [[Hag]] [[Malodora Grymm]], wife of [[Malodora Grymm's husband|the King]], became aware of her beauty through her [[talking mirror]], she used a [[poison]]ed [[Apple (fruit)|apple]] which she gave to her, which put her into a deep sleep. She appears to have been inserted into the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] fairy tale, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarves]]''.<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>
