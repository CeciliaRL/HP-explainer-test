Quintia McQuoid would be proud — as most of you know, this Championship has been held in this garden every seven years since 1407 in honour of Quintia McQuoid, that most memorable of potioneers, whose love affair with potions sadly came to an end with her untimely death from drinking an imperfectly-brewed cure for ague.|The Wizarding Schools Potions Championship announcer|Wonderbook: Book of Potions}}
