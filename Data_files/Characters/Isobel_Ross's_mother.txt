'''Mrs Ross''' was a Scottish [[wizardkind|witch]] and she and [[Isobel Ross's father|her husband]] had at least one child, [[Isobel Ross|Isobel]].<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|professor-mcgonagall}} (transcription available [http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?s=4a2e751bddc00f9618a0b1bb6d9ce6fc&p=481284&postcount=443 here])</ref>

When Isobel became romantically involved with a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbour, [[Robert McGonagall Senior|Robert McGonagall]], she knew her parents would not approve, and thus she chose to keep the relationship a secret. Eventually, the young couple eloped, provoking the Ross' anger to the extent that they completely cut off ties with their daughter.<ref name="pottermore" />
