'''Minister Archer Evermonde''' was [[Minister for Magic]] from [[1912]] to [[1923]]. He was ultimately elected at least twice.<ref name="WW"/>

==Biography==
During Minister Evermonde's term, the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] world became involved in a large-scale military conflict that became known as the [[First World War]]. Evermonde was responsible for passing [[Archer Evermonde's emergency legislation|emergency legislation]] forbidding wizards and witches to get involved, in an attempt to prevent mass breaches of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|International Statue of Secrecy]]. 

This did not prevent thousands of wizards from aiding Muggles discreetly and where they could.<ref name="WW">{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref> For these actions, Minister Evermonde earned [[Wizengamot]] member [[Henry Potter]]'s public condemnation, which caused a minor stir at the time.<ref name="PotterFamilyPottermore">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref>

Some wizards, like [[Theseus Scamander]] directly served, in apparent defiance of Evermonde's legislation.<ref name="FB60">{{FB|S|60}}</ref>
