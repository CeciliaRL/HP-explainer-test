}}'''Nigelle le Narcissique''' was a circus performer in the [[1920s]]. 

==Biography==
She was part of the [[Circus Arcanus]], a travelling freak show, which billed her as a "bona fide" member of the species ''[[Homo amphibia]]'', a [[human]]oid reptilian who "freakishly devour[ed]" her own tail while singing popular [[Gaelic]] folk songs.<ref name="poster">[http://store.minalima.com/shop/fantastic-beasts/limited-edition-prints/no-maj-street-posters/circus-arcanus-museum-of-human-oddities-poster/ MinaLima Store - Circus Arcanus - Museum of Human Oddities Poster] {{see image|File:Circus Arcanus.png}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*While being named "Nigelle", a seemingly female name, the french article used to describe it, "le", is masculine. If Nigelle was a female, its name should be Nigelle "la" Narcissique.
*"Narcissique" is the french for Narcissistic.
