==Biography==
Along with the other former members of the team, he attempted to steal a [[Hebridean Black]] [[dragon]] from [[Martin MacFusty]] and the [[MacFusty clan]] in order to use it as the team's mascot in hopes of returning the team to glory, but were prevented from doing so by [[Jacob's sibling]].<ref name="MJM">{{HM|6|More Than Just a Mascot}}</ref>

==Magical abilites and skills==
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Given how he played the position of [[Keeper]] of the [[Banchory Bangers]],<ref name="MJM"/> he presumably had some ability flying a [[broomstick]], although his team were known for their poor skills.<ref name="QTA5">{{QTA|R|5}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*If he was educated, he most likely went to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as the [[Banchory Bangers]] were based in [[Scotland]] which Hogwarts resided in.
