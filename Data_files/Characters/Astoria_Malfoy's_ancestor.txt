{{Quote|We were capable of having children, but Astoria was frail. A blood malediction, a serious one. An ancestor was cursed... it showed up in her. You know how these things can resurface after generations...|[[Draco Malfoy]]|Harry Potter and the Cursed Child}}
This '''individual''' was an ancestor of [[Daphne Greengrass|Daphne]] and [[Astoria Malfoy|Astoria Greengrass]] who was [[curse]]d with a [[blood malediction]]. The curse resurfaced after several generations in Astoria, and was responsible for her lifelong frailty and untimely [[death]].<ref name="Act4Scene4">{{CC|B|4|4}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The reason for the Astoria's ancestor being cursed with a [[blood malediction]] causing death and passed down to their descendant is unknown, nor is it known whether they deserved it or if they were killed by it.
*Daphne Greengrass, Astoria Malfoy, and Scorpius Malfoy are the only confirmed descendants of this individual. However, in {{WU}}, it is revealed that [[Cereus Greengrass]] suffers from a blood malediction as well. It is unknown if this is the same blood malediction passed on by this common ancestor.
