'''Charlus Potter''' was a [[pure-blood]]<ref>Since [[Dorea Black]] was not disowned by her [[House of Black|family]] (who believed strongly in the importance of [[Blood status|blood purity]]), it can be assumed that Charlus was a respectable [[pure-blood]] wizard it was also stated that the [[Potter family|Potters]] were a pure-blood family, until the birth of [[Harry Potter]].</ref> [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and a member of the [[Potter family]]. He married [[Dorea Black]] and together they had [[Charlus Potter's son|a son]].

Charlus was the uncle by marriage of [[Alphard Black|Alphard]], [[Cygnus Black III|Cygnus]] and [[Walburga Black]], thus he is the great-uncle of [[Sirius Black III]] and [[Regulus Black]] II, as well as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Andromeda Tonks]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy]]. As well as this, Charlus is the great-great uncle of [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] and the great-great-great uncle of [[Scorpius Malfoy]] and [[Edward Lupin|Ted Lupin]]. Also, he is related in some way to [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and his son, the famous [[Harry Potter]].

==Etymology==
*''Charlus'' could refer back to the name ''Charles''. It is derived from the Germanic ''karl ''or ''hari''. It can mean "man", "army" or "warrior". This can relate to many members of the Potter family.
*Potter is a very common surname of English origin. It traditionally refers to the occupation of making pottery. {{wplink|Beatrix Potter}} was a well-known English children's author. {{wplink|Potter's field}} is the name for a burial ground for the unknown or unclaimed dead, particularly soldiers and orphans. The Potter family had many members that fit that description. The {{wplink|Potter Box}} is a model for making ethical decisions developed at Harvard University. J. K. Rowling has also commented that she has liked the name since childhood, as a family that had lived near her carried this surname.<ref>[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/0399-barnesandnoble.html Barnes and Noble interview, March 19, 1999]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*There was some speculation that Charlus Potter was the father of [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and the paternal grandfather of [[Harry Potter]]. Later, {{PM}} has revealed that [[Fleamont Potter]], not Charlus, is Harry's grandfather. In spite of this, it is still more than likely that Charlus was an uncle or cousin of James Potter and his descendants, or perhaps a more distant relative of [[Abraham Potter]].
*Charlus was not featured on the Potter family tree on {{PM}}. So it is possible he is not closely related to any of the Potters that are featured on that tree.
*[[J. K. Rowling]] has stated that Harry had no family remaining other than the Dursleys at the time of [[Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Attack at Godric's Hollow (1981)|attack on Godric's Hollow]], suggesting that Charlus, and any descendants he might have had otherwise, were dead by this time. However, this is not fully confirmed, and it is not known exactly what happened to them.
