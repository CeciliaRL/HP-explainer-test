'''Albert Sallow''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who worked at the [[British Ministry of Magic]] in the [[2010s]], in the capacity of [[Unspeakable]].<ref name="WUtrailer">{{WU}} {{see image|File:WU trailer documents ref.png}}</ref>

==Biography==
At some point in his career, he entered the [[Love Chamber]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]]; the log documenting the time of his entry and exit was brought to light during the investigation over the [[Calamity]], as it also showed [[Grim Fawley]] was frequently in the room at odd times.<ref name="WUtrailer"/>

At some point during at least the [[2010s]], Sallow took members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] on an informal tour of the Department of Mysteries. While on the tour, he taught the task force members about many of the mysterious artefacts kept within the department.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>
