He was present at the bank when [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Griphook]] hosted a break-in in order to retrieve one of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Horcrux]]es, [[Helga Hufflepuff's Cup]], from the [[Lestrange Vault]].<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

When the Gringotts dragon started to escape, the goblin became shocked and most likely got killed by it when he appeared not to be running from his seat, but his fate is unknown.
