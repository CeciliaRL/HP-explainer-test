'''Don Harrison''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] construction foreman. 

==Biography==
When beginning construction project in a forest that was home to [[magic]]al [[beast]]s, his site and workers were attacked. Six of the workers walked off the job as a result.<ref>{{FBC}} - Case 3</ref>

Harrison's daughter [[Bethany Harrison|Bethany]] was at the site during the attack and made a [[Bethany Harrison's drawing|drawing]] of the beast responsible.

During the subsequent [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] investigation (during which [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner]], of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], posed as Muggle inspectors from the local constabulary), his daughter [[Bethany Harrison|Bethany]] went missing. A distraught Don Harrison pledged to level the whole forest to find her, before being calmed down by Mathilda, who assured him they would find his daughter.<ref name="FBC3.2">{{FBC|3|2}}</ref>
