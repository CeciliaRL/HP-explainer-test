'''Malcolm McGonagall''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[half-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was the second child and first son of the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Robert McGonagall Senior|Robert McGonagall]] and witch [[Isobel Ross]].<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|professor-mcgonagall}}</ref>

==Biography==
Malcolm revealed his [[magic]]al ability at an early age. His mother, and his older sister [[Minerva McGonagall|Minerva]], worked together to teach him and his younger brother, [[Robert McGonagall Jr|Robert Jr]], that they could not go about showing off their magic. They also worked to conceal the "accidents and embarrassments" that the two boys' magic sometimes caused from their father.<ref name="pottermore" />

Malcolm eventually fathered at least one child. His offspring would often visit his sister's home in [[Hogsmeade]] during her brief marriage between [[1981]] and [[1984]].<ref name="pottermore" />
