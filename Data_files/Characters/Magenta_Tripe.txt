'''Magenta Black''' (née '''Tripe''') (fl. [[19th century]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] married to the pure-blood wizard, [[Licorus Black]], who was the earliest known member of the [[House of Black]]. Her name appears on the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]] that hangs in the ancestral home of [[12 Grimmauld Place]]. It is possible that she was [[Misapinoa Black|Misapinoa]], [[Cygnus Black I|Cygnus I]] and [[Arcturus Black I|Arcturus I]]'s mother.<ref>See [[:File:Licorus Black.jpg|this image]].</ref>
==Etymology==
[[wikipedia:Magenta|Magenta]] is a bright pinkish purple colour. (Scientifically, it is a precisely equal mixture of red and blue; it is one of the three subtractive primary colours (CMY/CMYK colour spaces) and one of the three pure additive secondary colours (RGB colour space).) [[wikipedia:Tripe|Tripe]] (from French ''tripe'') is a type of edible offal from the stomachs of various farm animals. It is also used in modern English as a fairly polite synonym for nonsense.

*This character appears only on the version of the Black family tree shown in {{OOTP|FA}}. She was not included on the version of the tree which [[J. K. Rowling]] gave to a charity auction in 2006<ref>"[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/blackfamilytree.html Black Family Tree]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref>. However, according to director [[David Yates]], Rowling provided the filmmakers with a copy of the Black family tree going back eight generations<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20071218224958/http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/5/24/empire-magazine-feature-on-ootp 'Empire' Magazine Feature on OotP]" from The Leaky Cauldron</ref>. The filmmakers presumably received a more complete version of the tree than the one auctioned off, which only goes back six generations.
