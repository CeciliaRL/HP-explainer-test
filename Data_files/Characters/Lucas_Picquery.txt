'''Lucas Picquery'''<ref name="UVB"/> was an American [[wizardkind|wizard]] who played as a [[Beater]] for the [[2014]] [[American National Quidditch team]]. According to [[Ludovic Bagman]] in a report to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', Beaters Picquery and [[Pringle]] would have to "''find better form''" if they were to best the [[Brazilian National Quidditch team|Brazilian]] Beaters [[Rafael Santos|Santos]] and [[Carlos Clodoaldo|Clodoaldo]] in their semi-final match on [[4 July]], [[2014]].<ref name="PM">{{PM}} - [[PLACE YOUR BETS WITH LUDO BAGMAN]] (Archived)</ref>

==Biography==
Bagman, however, had spoken too soon.<ref name="UVB"/> On the first day of the match on [[4 July]], Picquery sent a [[Bludger]] right into the face of the American [[Keeper]] [[Susan Blancheflower]], prompting her to leap onto his broomstick to reprimand him, leaving the goal wide open and allowing [[Alejandra Alonso]] to score a goal.<ref name="UVB"/>

During the playoffs for third place against [[Japan]] on [[9 July]], Picquery mostly kept his head down until the end when he stopped his own [[Seeker]] for competing against [[Noriko Sato]] for the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]]. Him and [[Darius Smackhammer]] were caught in a broom-lock, although they embraced the other team upon landing.
