{{Quote|Been having a lot of trouble with him. Needs a Memory Charm ten times a day to keep him happy. And Ludo Bagman's not helping. Trotting around talking about Bludgers and Quaffles at the top of his voice, not a worry about anti-Muggle security! Blimey, I'll be glad when this is over. See you later, Arthur.|The [[Obliviator]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
This '''[[Wizardkind|wizard]]''' was a [[British Ministry of Magic]] [[Obliviator]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="GOF7"/>

==Biography==
During the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], he was stationed at [[Roberts|Mr Roberts]]' [[Quidditch World Cup Campsite|campsite]]. He [[Apparition|apparated]] in front of Roberts's front-door and used the [[Memory Charm]] to erase his memories of the [[wizarding world]]. Mr Roberts' had started to question incessantly about the things he was experiencing such as [[Unidentified man who tried to pay Mr Roberts with Galleons|a man]] that tried to pay him with [[Galleon|big gold coins]] or [[Archie Aymslowe|a "weirdo" wearing a dress]]. He was one of several Obliviators sent to obliviate Roberts ten times a day.<ref name="GOF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref> 

The Obliviator was left exhausted, with his chin blue with stubble and deep purple shadows under his eyes. He told [[Arthur Weasley]] that the [[Charm]] had to be used ten times a day to keep Roberts from realising the [[Wizardkind|true nature]] of the "foreigners" in his campsite. He then proceeded to help the Weasleys, [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]] to their tent.<ref name="GOF7"/> 

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Like most accomplished adult wizards, he was capable of apparating at will.<ref name="GOF7"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Being an [[Obliviator]], he was highly proficient with the casting of the [[Memory Charm]].<ref name="GOF7"/>
