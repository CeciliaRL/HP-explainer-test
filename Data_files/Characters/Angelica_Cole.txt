'''Angelica Cole''' was a [[wizardkind|witch]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1980]]<ref name="age" /><ref name="graduation">[https://.twitter.com/themattlondon/status/1005427171459026945 For wiki clarity: Angelica, Chester, Jane, and Felix all entered Hogwarts Sept 1st 1980 and graduated Spring 1987.] by [https://.twitter.com/themattlondon Matt London on Twitter]</ref> and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]]. In [[1984]], she was made a [[Prefect]], and was responsible for watching over the [[first year]]s.<ref name="HM13">{{HM|1|3}} {{c|info revealed to [[Gryffindor]] players}}</ref>

Angelica was still at Hogwarts the following two years and graduated in [[1987]].<ref name="graduation" />

==Biography==
===Hogwarts years {{c|1980–1987}}===
Angelica became a Prefect in [[1984]]. She also became the [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|captain]] of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]].<ref name="Y3SQ" />

In the [[1986–1987 school year]],<ref name="Y3SQTwitter>[https://twitter.com/themattlondon/status/1005426309185630208 Yes we wrote the NHNick quest to add more Year 3 story. It is set during Year 3. Once a side quest spawns we don’t despawn it. That may cause continuity breaks (eg Ben missing and in common room) but getting to play the quests is more important.] by [https://.twitter.com/themattlondon Matt London on Twitter]</ref> she met up with [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]]. She revealed that she had always liked [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]].<ref name="Y3SQ"/>

She graduated from Hogwarts in [[1987]], and went on to join the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]].<ref name="graduation"/><ref name="HM4P">{{HM|4|Become a Prefect!}}</ref>

===After Hogwarts {{c|1987–}}===
{{Quote|I'm a Security Troll Trainer. It's difficult work, but I like the challenge.|Angelica regarding her difficult but rewarding career|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
[[File:Prefect Convention.jpg|thumb|left|Angelica meeting up with some other Prefects]]
After Hogwarts, Angelica was employed training [[Security troll]]s for the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="Y5SQ">{{HM|5|Yer a Prefect}}</ref>

In [[September]] [[1988]], she met up in the [[Three Broomsticks Inn]] with other former Prefects [[Chester Davies]], [[Jane Court]] and [[Felix Rosier]], as well as [[Head Boy or Girl|Head Boy]] [[William Weasley]] and Prefects at the time like [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] and [[Jacob's sibling]].<ref name="Y5SQ" /> At the end of the school year, in the summer of [[1989]], she attended Bill Weasley's graduation celebration in the same location.<ref name="HM533">{{HM|5|33}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Angelia was proficient with the casting of charms, such as the [[Freezing Charm]].<ref name="farewell">{{HM|3|Farewell My Prefect}}</ref> She also tutored [[first year]] students with the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]] as part of her prefect duties at Hogwarts.<ref name="Y3SQ"/>
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Angelica was skilled with the brewing of potions, such as [[Babbling Beverage]].<ref name="farewell"/>
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Angelia was skilled with the handling of [[magic]]al plants, such as [[Snargaluff]].<ref name="farewell"/>
*'''[[Care of Magical Creatures]]''': Angelica was talented with the handling and training of dangerous [[magic]]al [[beast]]s, such as with [[troll]]s, as she became a trainer of [[Security troll]]s for the Ministry of Magic in her adulthood.<ref name="Y5SQ"/>
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Angelina was presumably a skilled [[broomstick]] flyer and [[Quidditch]] player, as she was appointed the [[Quidditch Captain]] of the [[Gryffindor Quidditch team]] whilst at Hogwarts.<ref name="Y3SQ"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{HM}}, given the fact that she left the [[Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match (1985)|Gryffindor vs Slytherin]] match early in her sixth year (for [[Ravenclaw]] and [[Slytherin]] players),<ref name="HM23">{{HM|2|3}} {{c|scenario only available for Slytherin or Ravenclaw players}}</ref> it is possible she only became a regular on the Gryffindor Quidditch team in her [[seventh year]], during which she was the team's Captain. This would not be the only case of a new player becoming Quidditch Captain, as it was the case with [[Urquhart]] and the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]] in the [[1996–1997 school year]].<ref name="HBP14">{{HBP|B|14}}</ref>
*If [[Jacob's sibling]] is in Gryffindor, her position as Quidditch Captain causes a contradiction, as [[Orion Amari]] holds the position in the [[1986–1987 school year]].
*It is possible she came up with a few offensive flying formations.<ref name="HM3Q211">{{HM|3|Q2|11}} - For non-Gryffindor players, [[Andre Egwu]] states that a new female Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team has come up with a few offensive flying formations. This takes place in the same school year as the side quest where Angelica Cole is stated to be Quidditch Captain.</ref>
