The '''Merqueen''' was a [[Merpeople|merwoman]] who was an authority of the [[Great Lake Merpeople colony]].<ref name="HM642"/>

==Biography==
In the [[1989â€“1990 school year]], she helped [[Jacob's sibling]] finding the [[Sunken Vault]] after they offered her several presents.<ref name="HM642">{{HM|6|42}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Harry Potter (book series)|Harry Potter books]], the leader of the Merpeople, [[Murcus]], is referred to as the [[Merchieftainess]]. It is unclear if Merqueen was an alternative title, another position in the hierarchy or a different government system used in the [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]]. It's also unclear if this individual and Murcus were the same person.
