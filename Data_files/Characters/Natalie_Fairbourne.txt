'''Natalie Fairbourne''' was a [[Gryffindor]] [[Wizardkind|student]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]]. 

==Biography==
She claimed to be the best [[Exploding Snap]] player at Hogwarts, and, during the [[1996â€“1997 school year]], managed to win a [[Viktor Krum]] [[Miniature figurine of Viktor Krum|figurine]] through playing the game. She agreed to give this figurine to [[Harry Potter]] if he could beat her at a game of Exploding Snap.

==Etymology==
The name "Natalie" is from the Late Latin name Natalia, which meant "Christmas Day" from Latin natale domini. This was the name of the wife of the 4th-century martyr Saint Adrian of Nicomedia. She is venerated as a saint in the Orthodox Church, and the name has traditionally been more common among Eastern Christians than those in the West. It was popularised in America by actress Natalie Wood (1938-1981), who was born to Russian immigrants, and is now considered a fairly common name.
