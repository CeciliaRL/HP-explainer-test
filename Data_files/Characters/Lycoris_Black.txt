'''Lycoris Black''' ([[1904]] – [[1965]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], the middle child of [[Sirius Black II]] and his wife [[Hesper Gamp]] and sister of [[Arcturus Black III|Arcturus]] and [[Regulus Black]]. Lycoris never married and never had children.<ref name="BFT" />

==Etymology==
''[[Wikipedia:Lycoris|Lycoris]]'' means "twilight" in Greek. This name loosely fits into the Black family tradition of naming people after stars, in the sense that twilight denotes the times of day when the stars first begin to appear, or to disappear. It is also a [[Wikipedia:Lycoris (genus)|genus]] of flowering plants in the ''Amaryllis'' family that is associated with death and reincarnation in Chinese and [[Japan]]ese folklore; another member of family with a name of flower is [[Narcissa Malfoy]]. Ovid and [[Wikipedia:Virgil|Virgil]] also mention a mistress of [[Wikipedia:Mark Antony|Mark Antony]] called Lycoris. It is also possible that this name was derived from the plant and sweet [[Wikipedia:Licorice|liquorice]]. The name is also similar to that of [[wikipedia:Lycorias|Lycorias]], a Nereid (sea nymph) of Greek mythology.

==Behind the scenes==
*Lycoris Black's likeness on the [[Black Family Tapestry]], as featured in {{OOTP|FA}}, seems to have been based on [http://media.vam.ac.uk/media/thira/collection_images/2006BF/2006BF7031_jpg_l.jpg a depiction of a nobleman] from the [[Wikipedia:Devonshire Hunting Tapestries|Devonshire Hunting Tapestries]], currently in the collection of the [[Wikipedia:Victoria and Albert Museum|Victoria and Albert Museum]], in [[London]].
*Based on a statement by [[Horace Slughorn]] that all members of the Black family were in his house, Lycoris may have been a member of the [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. However, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] c. [[1915]] - [[1922]], when [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]] was not [[Potions Master]].
*Lycoris, on the [[House of Black|family]] [[Black Family Tapestry|tapestry]] in [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|the film adaption]] of {{OOTP}}, is depicted like a man rather than a woman.
*It can also be noted that Lycoris's name is similar to her distant relative [[Licorus Black]] who appears only on the version of the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]] shown in {{OOTP|FA}}.
