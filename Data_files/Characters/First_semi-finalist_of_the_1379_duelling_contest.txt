This '''individual''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who, in [[1379]], partook in an [[1379 duelling contest|international duelling contest]] on [[Dartmoor]].<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}}</ref>

The duelling was noted, by witnesses, to have been of a standard that few had ever seen before. As the contest progressed, only four contestants remained: this wizard, three more wizards, and an [[England|English]] witch, [[Elizabeth Smudgling]].<ref name="WBoS"/>

This wizard was the first semi-finalist, and was to take part in the first [[Duelling|duel]]. Keeping in mind the judges' advice to "think big", he transformed himself into a [[Cattle|bull]] and charged the [[Second semi-finalist of the 1379 duelling contest|second wizard]], who escaped [[death]] by quickly turning himself into a [[snake|viper]]. The [[Second semi-finalist of the 1379 duelling contest|second wizard]] bit the first on the leg, sending him crashing to the ground in pain.<ref name="WBoS" />

Considering that in the Middle Ages, before there was a [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] to regulate such matters, [[duelling]] was usually fatal,<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|R}} - ''Albus Dumbledore on "''The Tale of the Three Brothers''"''</ref> and given his particularly violent defeat, it is likely this individual died.
