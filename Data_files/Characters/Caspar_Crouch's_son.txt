The only '''son''' of [[Caspar Crouch]] and [[Charis Black]] was a [[pure-blood]] wizard.<ref name="BFT">[[House of Black|Black family tree]]</ref> He had [[Caspar Crouch's daughters|two sisters]].

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that Caspar Crouch's son was [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Bartemius Crouch Snr]], who is described as an "elderly man" at the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]]. This is supported by the fact that he and [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|his son]] were the last of their family. However, his mother [[Charis Black|Charis]] was born in [[1919]], so, assuming she had her son after reaching the age of majority, the earliest he could have been born was [[1936]]. This would make it unlikely that he would be described as "elderly" in [[1994]]. But Rowling wrote all but the first chapter of ''Goblet of Fire'' in the third-person limited point-of-view, which means that the description of Crouch as "elderly" actually represents [[Harry Potter]]'s perception. A 58-year-old man might appear "elderly" to a 14-year-old boy, and it is also quite plausible that the tribulations Crouch went through during the [[First Wizarding War]] would have prematurely aged him. Also, terms like "elderly" can be loosely used, without kind of mathematical rigour, especially by young people; for instance, [[Walburga Black]] in [[Walburga Black's portrait|her portrait]] was described as "old", despite not being more than sixty years old when the portrait was made.<ref>[[House of Black#Black family tree|Black family tree]]</ref> It should be noted, however, that [[Pollux Black|two]] [[Cygnus Black III|people]] featured on the [[House of Black#Black family tree|Black family tree]] become fathers at the age of thirteen; whether that was a mathematical mistake on Rowling's part or not is unclear, but Charis and her son might have been intended to be older than they appear to be.
*If Caspar Crouch's son is Barty Crouch Snr, then, through the [[House of Black|Black family]], Barty Crouch and [[Arthur Weasley]] are first cousins (both sharing [[Arcturus Black II|Arcturus Black]] and [[Lysandra Yaxley]] as maternal grandparents) and, by extension, Crouch's personal assistant [[Percy Weasley]] is his first cousin once removed. This relationship, if true, is not mentioned at all in {{GOF}}.
