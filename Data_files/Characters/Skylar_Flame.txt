'''Skylar Flame''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard or witch]] who founded the [[Sphinx Club]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the [[1800s]].<ref name="HM5T"/>

==Biography==
In their youth, Flame received their magical education from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Flame was in a study group with [[Margaretta Ironbark]] and [[Olin Oakwood]]. They pressured Olin to compete in the tournament, along with Margaretta. The competition got the best of them and turned them into grudging enemies. After he defeated them and won the tournament, their study group fell apart and each of them formed their own clubs, each one dedicated to the areas of study that suited them best.<ref name="HM5T">{{HM|5|THE TOURNAMENT OF CLUBS}}</ref>

At some point, Flame wrote a historical manuscript that was entitled, ''"[[Olin the Cheat]]"''. The contents of this dissertation detailed the dastardly deeds of a [[Olin Oakwood|cruel wizard]]. Flame wrote that Olin had lied to her and pretended to be her friend.<ref name="HM5T"/>
