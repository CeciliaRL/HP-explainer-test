'''Norville Bezerko''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who coveted the hand of [[Daisy Twemlove]], even though she was engaged to [[Perseus Ecklington]].<ref name="BPsleepingpotion">{{WBP}} - see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk-PJsIbGX8&list=PLu-YMfPspAuGcYXaC2J1A2gb-0Zp34GI3&index=18 this video]</ref>

On the eve of his love rival's wedding to Daisy Twemlove, Bezerko slipped a powerful [[Sleeping Potion]] into his [[butterbeer]] mug, sending him into a deep death-like sleep. Bezerko prompty presented himself at Daisy's house, telling her that Ecklington had died of panic at the prospect of marrying her. An unsuspecting Daisy accepted to marry Bezerko the moment Ecklington was buried.<ref name="BPsleepingpotion"/>

Ecklington was put in a coffin, and, just as [[Funeral of Perseus Ecklington|he was being lowered into the ground]], he woke up, as the effects of the [[Sleeping Potion]] had worn off. Ecklington soon realised Bezerko's scheme, and a brawl ensued. Bezerko was left with an [[elephant]]'s trunk and six ears, thus hampering his chances of finding another bride, and Daisy Twemlove was reunited with Perseus Ecklington.<ref name="BPsleepingpotion"/>
