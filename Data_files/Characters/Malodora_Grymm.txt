}}'''Queen Malodora Grymm''' was a [[hag]] who lived in [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[Europe]].<ref name="POAG"/>

==Biography==
She used a [[Beautification Potion]] to transform herself into a beautiful woman, and married [[Malodora Grymm's husband|a king]]. She used a [[Talking mirror|charmed mirror]] to compliment her looks and reinforce her self-image. However, she became jealous of [[Malodora Grymm's victim|the most beautiful girl in the kingdom]] and plotted to get rid of her by using a [[poison]]ed [[Apple (fruit)|apple]].<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Grymm's plot, despite being known as historical fact to the [[wizarding world]], appeared to have directly inspired the Muggle fairy tale, ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarves]]''''.'''''

==Behind the scenes==
*In 2001, actress [[Miranda Richardson]], (who plays [[Rita Skeeter]]), took part in the film, [[Wikipedia:Snow White (2001 film)|Snow White: Fairest of Them All]], playing Queen Elspeth, who, like Malodora, was a hag turned into the beautiful and wicked Queen of the fairy tale.

==Etymology==
*Malodora consists of the noun "malus", "''apple''" in Latin (as in "malic acid", the acid which was named after apples and is found in many fruits) or adjective "malum", "''bad''" or "''evil''" in Latin; and "doron", "''gift''" in Greek (as in "Pandora" in Greek mythology, gift from all the gods). Thus, Malodora is "she who gifts apple" or "she who gives evil gift", which is a clear foreshadowing to her giving a poisoned apple to her victim.
*Grymm is a nod to the [[Wikipedia:Brothers Grimm|Brothers Grimm]]. It can be also a reference to the word grim, meaning "ghastly" or "sinister".
