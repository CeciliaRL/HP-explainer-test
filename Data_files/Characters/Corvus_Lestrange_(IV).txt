'''Corvus Lestrange''' (b. pre [[1879]] - d. pre [[1927]]) was a [[France|French]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] and a member of the [[pure-blood]]<ref name="Blood"/> [[Lestrange family]]. He was the son of [[Corvus Lestrange (III)|Corvus Lestrange]] and [[Eglantine Lestrange]]. He abducted [[Laurena Kama]] and had a daughter with her, [[Leta Lestrange]]. When Laurena died, he married [[Clarisse Lestrange|Clarisse Tremblay]] and had a son with her, [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus]].<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>

==Biography==
Corvus was acquainted with the Kama Family. One night, Corvus Lestrange put [[Laurena Kama]] under the [[Imperius Curse]] to lure her away from her family. He had a daughter with her, [[Leta Lestrange]]. Laurena died shortly after. Shortly after he married [[Clarisse Lestrange|Clarisse Tremblay]]. Their union produced a son, [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus]]. When Clarisse died, Corvus was the light in his eyes.<ref name="COGS"/>

[[Yusuf Kama]], son of Laurena Kama and [[Mustafa Kama]], swore an [[Unbreakable Vow]] to kill young Corvus and end the Lestrange lineage as revenge for the abduction of his mother. In an attempt to protect his son, Lestrange sent both him and his daughter Leta to America along with his servant Irma Dugard. Sometime afterwards he passed away, and a family tree he owned ended up at the French ministry.<ref name="COGS"/>

Yusuf mistakenly believed [[Credence Barebone]] to be Corvus Lestrange (along with much of the rest of the wizarding world), as he was unaware that a young Leta had switched Corvus in his crib with [[Aurelius Dumbledore]], and attempted to resolve his vow by killing Credence.<ref name="COGS"/>

After his death, Corvus Lestrange's remains were interred at the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]], at the [[Cimetière du Père-Lachaise]], in [[Paris]], his [[Corvus Lestrange (IV)'s tomb|grand marble tomb]] dominating the many sarcophagi there.<ref name="COG91">{{COG|S|91}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
From what is known of his history, Corvus (IV) seemed to be a cold-hearted man who was not above using dark magic or forcing a woman into marriage. Furthermore, he did not care about the consequences of his actions, showing him to be rather ruthless, selfish and egotistical. He did not love his daughter Leta or Clarisse Tremblay, but loved his son, possibly because Corvus V's birth meant the future survival of his family line.<ref name="COGS"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Corvus was able to successfully cast the [[Imperius Curse]] on [[Laurena Kama]], allowing him to keep her against her will. His proficiency in casting this [[Unforgivable Curses|Unforgivable Curse]] implies he was a skilled [[Dark Wizard]].<ref name="COGS"/>

==Etymology==
"[[wikipedia:Corvus|Corvus]]" is Latin for "[[raven]]", probably from the Greek κόραξ (''korax'', "[[wikipedia:raven|raven]]"). ''Corvus'' is the genus of medium to large black birds including crows, ravens, jackdaws and the like. This is thus an allusion to the Dark nature of the Lestrange family, as such birds (particularly ravens) have often been harbingers of doom in folklore.
