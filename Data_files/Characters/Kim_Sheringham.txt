==Biography==
In [[1996]], she took [[Luna Lovegood's dress robes|a silver dress]] belonging to [[Luna Lovegood]], which she described as "''horrid''" and thought needed to be hidden "''somewhere dark.''" Luna wanted to wear this dress to [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn]]'s [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]]. However, although she said she thought it ought to be kept out of sight, Kim wore the dress herself in public, allowing [[Harry Potter]] to find her in the [[Clock Tower Courtyard]]. Harry had to give her a bottle of [[Butterbeer]] in order to get her to give the dress back.<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>
