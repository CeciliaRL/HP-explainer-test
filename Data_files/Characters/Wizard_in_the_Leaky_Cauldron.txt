This '''[[Wizardkind|wizard]]''' was seen in the [[Leaky Cauldron]] in [[1993]], reading the [[Muggle world|Muggle]] physics book ''[[A Brief History of Time]]'' by [[Stephen Hawking|Stephen W. Hawking]] while performing [[wandless magic]] on his cup of [[coffee]], causing it to stir itself.<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}} - Chapter 4 (''The Leaky Cauldron'')</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Wandless magic]]''': This wizard was capable of stirring a cup of coffee [[magic]]ally by simply using his hand, which is highly advanced and difficult magic to accomplish.<ref name="POAF"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*This wizard was portrayed by [[Ian Brown]] in {{POA|FA}} in a celebrity cameo.
*His reading of a book titled ''A Brief History of Time'' is likely foreshadowing for the use of [[time]] travel later in [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban|the film]]. 
**[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553346148/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i14 Said book] was published in [[1990]] in real life. Therefore, it can't be suggested as a proof that the wizard might actually be a time traveller himself since the scene is placed in 1993.
**He does not appear in the {{POA}} book.
