{{Quote|The room at the top of the house where Ron slept looked much as it had the last time that Harry had come to stay: the same posters of Ronâ€™s favourite Quidditch team, the Chudley Cannons, were whirling and waving on the walls and sloping ceiling, and the fish tank on the windowsill, which had previously held frog spawn, now contained one extremely large frog.|Description.|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
[[Ronald Weasley]] had a '''frog''' which he kept in a fish tank on the windowsill in his [[Ronald Weasley's bedroom|bedroom]] at [[The Burrow]].<ref name="GF5">{{GOF|B|5}}</ref> In the summer of [[1992]], the fish tank contained a large number of frog spawn,<ref name="CS3">{{COS|B|3}}</ref> but by the summer of [[1994]], it contained just one extremely large frog.<ref name="GF5"/>
