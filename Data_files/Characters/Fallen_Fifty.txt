The '''Fallen Fifty'''<ref name="CC46">{{CC|B|4|6}}</ref> (d. [[2 May]], [[1998]]) were the unknown people who were killed fighting [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]] in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], the final conflict of the [[Second Wizarding War]]. Their ranks included students who had refused to leave during the evacuations, Hogwarts staff and teachers, parents, and others who had rallied to defend Hogwarts when Voldemort moved against it.<ref name="DH36"/>

At the end of the [[Battle of Hogwarts|battle]], all of the bodies were placed together in the [[Great Hall]]. Their deaths were ultimately not in vain, as the surviving defenders held the line, Voldemort was defeated and [[Voldemort's Last Stand|killed]], and the remaining Death Eaters disbanded permanently.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Besides [[Severus Snape]], [[Fred Weasley]], [[Vincent Crabbe]], [[Colin Creevey]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Nymphadora Tonks]], all the other casualties were unidentified individuals, although [[Gregory Goyle]] died in place of Crabbe in the final film as well. It is possible that the [[Unidentified Hogwarts students killed on the Seventh Floor]] and [[Unidentified wizard killed at the Quad battlements]] are part of the Fallen Fifty.
*No Death Eaters were counted among the Fallen Fifty.
*[[Remus Lupin]] is the single non-human casualty counted among the Fallen Fifty. 
*[[Harry Potter]] did not see anyone he recognised dead, besides those he named.<ref name="DH32">{{DH|B|32}}</ref> It is likely that half of the fallen would have been fellow students, the rest possibly members of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], staff members, or residents of [[Hogsmeade]].
*There may well have been even more casualties than just fifty, but the bodies of these may not have been collected at that point, as Colin Creevey's body was discovered out on the school grounds by [[Oliver Wood]] and [[Neville Longbottom]] and as [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]] is such a large place it is unlikely that all bodies were retrieved and brought back to the Hall during that phase of the battle. In addition, we know that the Death Eaters created many explosions and fires, and some bodies may simply have never been found. Some might have also fallen into the ravines or been Transfigured.
**It is possible that Harry did know people among the unnamed casualties, but that their names simply weren't mentioned so as not to clutter the narrative of the story's conclusion with a lengthy roll call of minor characters.
