'''David''' was a [[king]] who ruled over [[wikipedia:United Kingdom of Israel and Judah|Israel and Judah]] during ancient times.<ref name="wikipedia1">"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David David]" on Wikipedia</ref> He was a prominent figure in the [[Bible]], and was credited with writing many of the psalms contained in one of its books, the [[wikipedia:Book of Psalms|Book of Psalms]].<ref name="wikipedia1" /> 

The [[Psalter]], a volume incorporating the Book of Psalms and other devotional writings, was included in the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]''.<ref name="hple">{{HPLE|G}} {{see image|File:The Book of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and other Rites & Ceremonies of the Church according to the use of the Church of England together with the Psalter or Psalms of David.png}}</ref><ref name="wikipedia2">"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalter Psalter] on Wikipedia]</ref> A copy of the ''Book of Common Prayer'' was kept in the [[Hogwarts Library|library]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="hple" />

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Bible]], David slays the [[giant]] [[Goliath]] while still a boy, casting a stone at him with a sling. However, the [[Chocolate Frog Card]] for Goliath only refers to the giant's slayer as a "young boy," and does not explicitly name David. It is thus possible that Goliath was not slain by David in the [[Harry Potter universe|''Harry Potter'' universe]].
