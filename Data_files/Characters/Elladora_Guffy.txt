'''Elladora Guffy''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived next door to [[Ethelbard Mordaunt]]. Madam Guffy was fond of practical jokes and had been known on occasion to [[Charm|enchant]] Mordaunt's garden furniture. This infuriated Mordaunt, which he once expressed to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' in a letter.<ref name="DP">{{DP}}: [[31 July]], [[1998]], Page 3</ref>
