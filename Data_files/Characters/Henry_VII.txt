'''Henry VII''' ([[28 January]] [[1457]] – [[21 April]] [[1509]]) was [[King]] of [[England]] from his seizure of the crown in [[1485]] until his [[death]].<ref name="wikipedia">"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_VII_of_England Henry VII of England]" on Wikipedia</ref>

He was the father of King [[Henry VIII]] and the grandfather of Queens [[Mary I]] and [[Elizabeth I]].<ref name="wikipedia" />

[[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] at King Henry's royal court.<ref name="pm">{{WW|hogwarts-ghosts}}</ref><ref name="TBB">{{TBB|R}} - ''Albus Dumbledore on "The Wizard and the Hopping Pot"''</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Henry" comes from the Germanic name Heimirich which meant "home ruler", composed of the elements heim "home" and ric "power, ruler". It was later commonly spelled Heinrich, with the spelling altered due to the influence of other Germanic names like Haganrich, in which the first element is hagan "enclosure".

==Behind the scenes==
*The [[portrait]] of [[Poderick Cruickshank]] seems to have been based on a [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:King_Henry_VII.jpg 1505 portrait] of Henry VII by an unknown artist.
