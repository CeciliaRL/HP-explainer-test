{{Quote|Celebrated inventor of the [[Self-Stirring Cauldron]].|Chocolate Frog Card|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
'''Gaspard Shingleton''' (b. [[1959]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizarding]] inventor who first devised the [[Self-Stirring Cauldron]].<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gaspard was born in 1959.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}}</ref>

===Adulthood===
At some point, he invented the [[Self-Stirring Cauldron]] and went down in history while still alive,<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}}</ref> being covered in first year [[History of Magic]] classes at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. The [[History of Magic]] [[First year exams|exam]] featured him.<ref name="PS16">{{PS|B|16}}</ref>

He was also immortalised on a silver [[Chocolate Frog Card]], as part of the [[Famous Witches and Wizards Cards]] series.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is weird that Gaspard Shingleton's achievements are covered so prominently in the [[1992]] [[History of Magic]] [[first year exams|first year exam]], when it is revealed in {{DH}} that "''Professor Bagshot doesn't cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century''"<ref name="DH16">{{DH|B|16}}</ref> in her [[A History of Magic|work]], which is used as the textbook for the subject.
**Similarly, the inventor of the Self-Stirring Cauldron is described as a "batty old [[Wizardkind|wizard]]" in {{PS}}, yet he would only be in his early thirties at the time.
