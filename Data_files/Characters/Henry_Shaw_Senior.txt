'''Henry Shaw Senior''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] newspaper magnate and founder of [[Shaw News]].<ref name="description" /> He was the father of [[Henry Shaw Junior]], a [[wikipedia:United States Senate|US Senator]] during the [[1920]]s,<ref name="SnitchSeeker" /> and [[Langdon Shaw]].<ref name="Pottermore" /> While Henry was proud of Henry Shaw Jnr, he did not think very highly of his younger son [[Langdon Shaw|Langdon]], whom he considered a disappointment.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Henry Shaw Senior was born in or before [[1854]]. He became a newspaper magnate by founding and running [[Shaw News]], a company that published several newspapers, including the [[New-York Clarion]]. He also fathered at least two children, [[Henry Shaw Junior]] and [[Langdon Shaw]].

===The Obscurus===

====Meeting Credence Barebone====

[[File:Shaw Family FB1.png|thumb|250px|The Shaw family addressing the Barebone family]]
After Langdon Shaw began to believe there was a [[Wizardkind|magical society living amongst them]], he brought [[Mary Lou Barebone]] from the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]] and her adopted children [[Credence Barebone|Credence]], [[Chastity Barebone|Chastity]], and [[Modesty Barebone|Modesty]] to his father's [[Shaw Tower|office]]. Langdon laid out a portfolio filled with a series of photographic evidence of [[magic|witchcraft]] and told his father of his belief that "strange things going all over" [[New York]]. However, both he and Henry Shaw Jnr dismissed his story.<ref name="description" /> Mary Lou asked to garnish the support of his newspaper company and his older son re-election platform. But Henry Shaw Senior refused, and asked the Barebone family to leave. While they were leaving, Mary Lou's adopted son Credence dropped a leaflet and his older son the Senator handed the leaflet back to him and called him a freak.<ref>{{FB|S|38}}</ref>

====Attack on the Fundraising Dinner Hall====

Shaw Snr looks devastated as he crouches beside his son.|Henry Shaw Snr reaction about the death of his son|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
Henry Shaw Snr was present at a rally for his elder son's supporters in [[New York]] in the [[Henry Shaw Junior's fundraising dinner|fund-raising dinner]], which was also picketed by members of the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]].<ref name="fbmsite1">"[http://www.fantasticbeastsmovies.com/index.php/2015/10/21/video-scene-being-filmed-updated/ Video: Scene Being Filmed (UPDATED)]" from FantasticBeastsMovies.com</ref><ref name="fbmsite2">"[http://www.fantasticbeastsmovies.com/index.php/2015/11/20/pottermore-set-report-3/ Pottermore Set Report #3]" from FantasticBeastsMovies.com</ref><ref name="bleedingcool">"[http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/11/07/will-it-be-jk-rowlings-fantastic-beasts-or-fascist-beasts/ Will It Be JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts – Or Fascist Beasts?]" from Bleeding Cool</ref> When his older son the Senator was in the middle of his speech, an [[Obscurus|invisible force]] burst forth from beneath the organ. It soared across the hall, sending tables flying, and throwing people around as it carved a line toward the stage where Shaw Jnr was still standing.

Henry Shaw Snr watched in horror as the invisible force threw his son backwards against his poster, and then raised him up high where he was suspended for just a moment in midair before being thrown violently back down onto the stage, dead. In the midst of sounds of anguish and panic from the crowd as Henry Shaw Snr fought his way through the crowd to reach his son's dead body, feeling devastated as he crouched beside his slain son.<ref>{{FB|S|58}}</ref>

====Obscurial attack on New York====
{{Quote|That thing killed my son — I want justice!|Henry Shaw Snr about Credence's Obscurus|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:Shaw Sr Fantastic Beasts CC Trailer.JPG|250px|thumb|Henry Shaw Senior witnessing the carnage in New York city]]
On the next night of [[7 December]] [[1926]], when Credence unleashed his Obscurus on New York, eventually taking refuge in the [[New York City Subway|subway station]], Shaw fought, along with his other son Langdon, to make his way through the crowd standing before the magical barrier conjured by [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]], declaring his intent to get justice for his son, and ordered his photographers to take as many photographs and vowed to expose [[wizardkind]]. However, come dawn, [[Newton Scamander]] released [[Frank]] the [[Thunderbird]] into the sky, creating a rainstorm laced with [[Swooping Evil venom]] that [[Memory Charm|Obliviated]] all memories of magic from the minds of Shaw and Langdon and every [[Muggle|No-Maj]] in New York.<ref>{{FB|S|109}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
Henry Shaw Snr was a very serious, ambitious and rational individual, who was strongly focused and dedicated to his role as the leader of a huge media empire and the success of both his newspapers and his eldest son Henry. Regarding his two sons, he was evidently elitist and in favour of Henry massively over Langdon, who he admired for his political ambitions and success as a politician, whilst clearly being contemptuous of Langdon for being less motivated and successful, and being prone to seemingly trivial pursuits and ideas. Initially, being a very serious and sharp individual, he rejected the belief of the existence of witchcraft or Wizardkind in New York City, believing it be irrational nonsense, and thus dismisses the Barebones and expresses disappointment in Langdon for believing it himself, showing he had little time or patience for imagination or unproven things. However, upon his discovery of the existence of Wizardkind and [[magic]] following Creedence's Obscurial form murdering Henry Shaw Jnr at his campaign dinner, he immediately expressed his desire for answers from and vengeance against the Wizarding community, and threatened to expose their magic to the world. He was fiercely dedicated to his family's success and well-being above all else in the world.
