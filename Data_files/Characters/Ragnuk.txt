'''King Ragnuk the First''' (fl. [[11th century]]) was the king of the [[goblin]]s during the lifetime of [[Godric Gryffindor]]. He was the maker of the famous [[Sword of Gryffindor]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Biography==
As the king of the goblins was also their finest silversmith, Ragnuk was commissioned by Gryffindor to forge [[Godric Gryffindor's Sword|a sword]] of pure [[goblin's silver]], with [[Ruby|rubies]] set into the hilt. By the time Ragnuk had finished the sword, however, he liked it so much that he sought to steal it back from Gryffindor. He sent a group of his subjects to retrieve the sword, but they were all fought off by Gryffindor, who was a skilled [[Duelling|duellist]]. Gryffindor [[Charm|bewitched]] the goblins to return to Ragnuk and inform him that, if he tried such a thing again, Gryffindor would use the sword to kill him and all his subjects.<ref name="Pottermore">{{PM|the-sword-of-gryffindor}}</ref>

Ragnuk made no further attempt to take the sword, however, a legend persisted in the goblin community that Gryffindor had stolen the sword, a myth perpetrated by the fact that goblins consider passing goblin-made possessions onto others without further payment to the maker, as Gryffindor would go on to do, as theft.<ref name="Pottermore"/> In fact, this myth was so prevalent in the [[goblin]] community, that it was the cause for one of the bloody [[Goblin Rebellions]] in the [[17th century|17th]] and [[18th century|18th centuries]], around six-hundred years after the Sword was fashioned.<ref name="JKRS">This piece of information comes from the third [[Wizards' Ordinary Magic and Basic Aptitude Test|W.O.M.B.A.T.]] featured in {{JKRS}}. Question 2 (''Part One - Magical History'') is "Which of the following did NOT provoke one of the bloody goblin rebellions of the 17th and 18th centuries? Choose ONE", and one of the possible answers is "''The allegation by goblin king Ragnuk the First that Godric Gryffindor had stolen his sword''". As one of the other answers is known for certain to be false ("''The imprisonment of the notoriously violent Hodrod the Horny-Handed, who had attempted to kill three wizards ''" — the {{DP}} reveal that [[Hodrod the Horny-Handed]] was indeed imprisoned for attempting to kill three wizards, but this happened in [[1999]], during the [[Chipping Clodbury riot]]), then all of the other answers must be true, including the one about Ragnuk's theft accusation.</ref>

===Post-mortem===
After his [[death]], Ragnuk was buried in a crypt in [[St Jerome's graveyard|the graveyard]] behind [[St Jerome's Church]], in [[Godric's Hollow]]. As he died holding a grudge against Godric Gryffindor, Ragnuk's embittered [[ghost]] remained haunting the crypt and expecting the sword to be returned to him. The crypt could only be opened with the passphrase "''pede poena claudo''" (literally translated from [[Latin]], "punishment comes limping", meaning retribution comes slowly but surely); driven by revenge, Ragnuk's spirit would emerge from the crypt to [[curse]] those who were searching for the sword — and, as a lure, the crypt displayed Gryffindor's coat of arms in pride of place.<ref name="HM3SOGH">{{HM|3|Secrets of Godric's Hollow}}</ref>

Just before [[Hallowe'en]] in [[1986]], [[Merula Snyde]] — following the footsteps of many of her ancestors over the centuries — attempted to determine the location of the [[Sword of Gryffindor]] and claim it as her own, using an old family clue to go "back to the source".<ref name="HM3SOGH"/>

Merula thought that the sword might have been buried with [[Godric Gryffindor]] and assumed his remains rested at Godric's Hollow. She tried to open the crypt marked with the crest of [[Gryffindor]], thereby provoking Ragnuk's wrath. Ragnuk [[curse]]d her, [[Ragnuk's curse|depriving her of her sight]]. [[Jacob's sibling]] quickly took her to [[Bathilda Bagshot]]'s house nearby to see if she could help. They learned that goblins used [[goblin magic|a special kind of wandless magic]], and the only one who could break the curse was Ragnuk himself. Back at the crypt, Jacob's sibling was able to convince Ragnuk that by letting others seek his sword, his legacy would live on. Ragnuk agreed to lift the curse from Merula and everyone who had came before her, before returning to his crypt.<ref name="HM3SOGH"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Goblin magic]]''': Being a [[Goblin]], Ragnuk was capable of performing [[magic]] which was both [[Wandless magic|wandless]] and powerful. He could still perform it after his death as a [[ghost]], and used it to [[curse]] [[Merula Snyde]], blinding her.<ref name="HM3SOGH"/>
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Ragnuk was capable of cursing [[Merula Snyde]] with a powerful unidentified [[curse]] which completely blinded her, that only he could lift.<ref name="HM3SOGH"/>
