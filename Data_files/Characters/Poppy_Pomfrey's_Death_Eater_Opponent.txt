This '''[[Dark Wizard|Dark witch]]''' was a member of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Death Eaters]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]].

==Biography==
At some point in her life, this [[Wizardkind|witch]] became learned in the [[Dark Arts]] and joined the Death Eaters, becoming a loyal follower and servant of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. It is likely that she fought during the [[First Wizarding War]], as most of her fellow Death Eaters did so.

She was seen attending the [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor|meeting]] at [[Malfoy Manor]] in [[1997]], in which Voldemort and the Death Eaters discussed the most efficient way of killing [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="DHF1">{{DH|F1}}</ref>

Much later on [[2 May]] [[1998]], she fought in the final battle of the Second War, the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] alongside her fellows and Voldemort himself. During the battle she duelled [[George Weasley]] and possibly others, before Voldemort ordered a temporary ceasefire. She was seen with the other Death Eaters in the [[Forbidden Forest]] where she witnessed Voldemort attempting to kill Harry Potter with a [[Killing Curse]].<ref name="DHF2"/>

Instead of abandoning the battle like the [[Malfoy family|Malfoys]] or some other [[Death Eaters]], she was fighting loyal to Voldemort alongside several members of the [[Death Eaters]], showing her to have been one of the more loyal Death Eaters and possibly one of the more sadistic ones. She was was last seen fighting against [[Poppy Pomfrey]] during the [[Skirmish at the Great Hall]], moments before [[Molly Weasley]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange]]'s duel started. Given how she fell down after Pomfrey lunged forward at her, she lost the duel to her opponent.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

After [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s defeat and [[death]], she might have been killed in battle, or arrested, tried and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for her crimes as a Death Eater.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, this witch would have been accomplished with dark magic, likely including the casting of the [[Unforgivable Curses]].
*'''[[Duelling]]''': This witch fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], being one of the last Death Eaters fighting before Voldemort's defeat. During the battle she was able to defeat [[George Weasley]] and fought against [[Poppy Pomfrey]], though she was unable to defeat the matron.<ref name="DHF2"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': She has some skill in the field of charms, as seen by her successful use of the [[Disarming Charm]] against [[George Weasley]].<ref name="DHF2"/>
