'''Madam Villanelle''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who worked at [[Flourish and Blotts]] in the [[1980s]] and early [[1990s]]. She was noted to be a skilled linguist.<ref name="HM510">{{HM|5|10}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Villanelle bought [[Villanelle's wand|her first wand]] from [[Garrick Ollivander]].<ref name="HM712">{{HM|7|12}}</ref>

===1988–1989 school year===
In late [[1988]],<ref>In Year 6 Chapter 6, Villanelle says that her first meeting with Jacob's sibling was "at the end of last year" and as their meeting happened in Chapter 10 out of a total of 34 chapters in Year 5, it is unlikely she was referring to the school year. Additionally, in the previous chapter, [[Rubeus Hagrid]] mentions his birthday being soon, and his birthday is in [[December]], the last month of the year. As such, "last year" presumably refers to the year 1988.</ref> she met [[Jacob's sibling]], who visited the shop in order to find clues about their [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|brother]].<ref name="HM510"/>

The [[1989|following year]], Jacob visited the shop and bought some books about the [[Mahoutokoro School of Magic]]. Jacob's sibling visited the shop shortly afterwards and asked Madam Villanelle about their brother's visit.<ref name="HM66">{{HM|6|6}}</ref>

===1989–1990 school year===
At some point near the end of the [[1989–1990 school year]], Villanelle told Jacob's sibling and [[Mundungus Fletcher]] information of a dark witch who had been gathering information about Jacob's sibling and [[Jacob's sibling's second wand|their wand]] (who turned out to be the [[Dark Witch in Knockturn Alley]]).<ref name="HM645">{{HM|6|45}}</ref>

===1990–1991 school year===
During the [[1990–1991 school year]], Villanelle used [[Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution]] and lost some [[Memory|memories]] due to the memory-erasing properties of it. [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Ben Copper]] paid her a visit during their investigation of [[Garrick Ollivander]]'s [[Garrick Ollivander's misfiring wand|misfiring wand]].<ref name="HM712">{{HM|7|12}}</ref> Villanelle was later given the [[Counter-serum for Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution|counter-serum]], which stopped the effects of the potion on her memory.<ref name="HM715">{{HM|7|15}}</ref>

==Possessions==
*'''[[Villanelle's wand|Wand]]''': Villanelle owned a [[wand]] of unknown specifications, that was manufactured and sold by [[Garrick Ollivander]] in his shop [[Ollivanders]].<ref name="HM712"/>
