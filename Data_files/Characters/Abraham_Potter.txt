'''Abraham Potter''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and one of the [[Auror#Twelve originals|original twelve]] [[Auror]]s in the [[United States of America]].<ref name="PM"/>

==Biography==
Abraham was born into the American branch of the [[Potter family]], which traces its origins to [[Ignotus Peverell]], one of the three brothers mentioned in ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]'' in ''[[The Tales of Beedle the Bard]]''; and [[Linfred of Stinchcombe]], nicknamed '''The Potterer''', a pioneering potioneer credited with the invention of numerous medicinal potions. This makes him a distant relative of the famous [[Harry Potter]], a fact which would be uncovered by eager genealogists centuries later.<ref name="PM">{{WW|macusa}}</ref>

After completing a surely arduous process, Abraham became an Auror. He was, along with eleven other wizards and witches, one of the first Aurors in the United States of America, being recruited by [[Josiah Jackson]], the first [[President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America|President]] of [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]].

He died before reaching "old age."<ref name="PM"/>
