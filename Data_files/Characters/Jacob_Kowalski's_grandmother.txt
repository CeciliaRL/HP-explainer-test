The '''grandmother''' of [[Jacob Kowalski]] lived in the early [[20th century]]. She was an experienced baker, as her grandson mentioned her recipe for [[paczki]] when he applied for a loan to open [[Kowalski Quality Baked Goods|his own bakery]]<ref>{{FB|S|11}}</ref>. She was also responsible to instilling a love of baking into him.

A picture of her hung above Jacob Kowalski's bed at his [[Jacob Kowalski's apartment|home]] in [[New York]].<ref>{{FB|F}}</ref>

She most likely died sometime before [[1926]], given the way Jacob talks to her portrait.
