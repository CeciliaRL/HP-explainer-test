{{Quote|While there have been no proven referee slayings since ''[1357]'', there have been several incidences of broom-tampering over the centuries, the most dangerous being the transformation of the referee's broom into a Portkey, so that he or she is whisked away from the match halfway through and turns up months later in the Sahara Desert.|[[Kennilworthy Whisp]], {{QTA}}.|Quidditch Through the Ages (real)}}
This '''[[Wizardkind|wizard]]''' was a [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch referee|referee]] sometime between [[1357]] and the [[1990s]]. During one of the matches he refereed, he found himself transported to the [[Sahara Desert]], as someone from the crowd of spectators [[Portus|transformed]] his [[broomstick]] into a [[Portkey]].<ref name="QTAR6">{{QTA|R|6}}</ref>
