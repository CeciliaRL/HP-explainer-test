'''Mr Slughorn''' was a wealthy [[Great Britain|British]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] born into the ancient [[Slughorn family]], a high-ranking [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] bureaucrat in the [[Department of International Magical Co-operation]], and the father of [[Horace Slughorn|Professor Horace Slughorn]].<ref name="PP"/>

Regarded as a doting parent, he brought up his only son from a young age to believe in the value of the family's connections, and encouraged him to make friends "''of the right sort''" once he arrived at Hogwarts. While Slughorn's father was never "militant" in his [[Pure-blood supremacy|Pure-blood beliefs]], he encouraged a quiet belief in the family's natural superiority.<ref name="PP" />

Despite his parents' ambitions for Horace at the Ministry, their son was never drawn to politics, preferring a less taxing existence.<ref name="PP" />

Mr Slughorn and his wife had already died by the time their son retired from teaching at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] late in [[1981]].<ref name="PP" />
