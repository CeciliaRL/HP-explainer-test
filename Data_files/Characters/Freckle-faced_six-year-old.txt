{{Quote|One freckle-faced six-year-old left the hall in tears. 'I loved stooging,' he sobbed to the ''Daily Prophet''. 'Me and me dad like watching them Keepers flattened. I don't want to go to Quidditch no more.'|''[[Daily Prophet]]''|Quidditch Through the Ages (real)}}
This '''individual''' (born c. [[1878]]) was among the crowd of [[Quidditch]] fans present at the announcement of the ban on [[Stooging]] by the [[Department of Magical Games and Sports]] on [[21 June]], [[1884]]. Much like the rest of the crowd present, this boy expressed his displeasure at the ban, telling a ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' reporter that he liked "watching them [[Keeper]]s flattened" and that the announcement made him not "want to go to Quidditch no more".<ref name="QTAR">{{QTA|R|6}}</ref>
