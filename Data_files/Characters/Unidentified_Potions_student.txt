{{Quote|I should point out, however, only once did a student manage to brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize. Nevertheless, good luck to you all.|[[Horace Slughorn]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)}}

This '''student''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard or witch]] and a student of [[Horace Slughorn]]'s during his first tenure as [[Potions Master]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] (between c. [[1920]] and [[1981]]). They were the first and only student before [[Harry Potter]] to brew a [[Draught of Living Death]] with sufficient quality to earn a small vial of [[Felix Felicis]].<ref>{{HBP|F}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This student may have been a member of the [[Slug Club]], as [[Professor]] [[Horace Slughorn|Slughorn]] accepts talented students.
*It is possible that this student may have been [[Tom Riddle]], but is more likely it may have been [[Severus Snape]] or [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]] who were both known to have had an aptitude for Potions.
