'''Artemis''' was the [[Greece|Greek]] [[god]]dess of the hunt and the [[Moon]]. The scientific name for [[wormwood]], ''Artemisia absinthium'', is derived from the name of Artemis.<ref name="WBP">{{WBP}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Despite originally being a female name, Artemis is one of the middle names of [[Newton Scamander]], author of {{FB}} as well as [[Artemisia Lufkin]] whose first name Artemisia is a feminine form of Artemisios, a Greek name which derived from [[Artemis (goddess)|Artemis]]. Newt shares this trait with Artemis Fowl, the protagonist of a popular fantasy book series sometimes compared to the ''Harry Potter'' franchise. However, it is unlikely that a reference was intended; rather, it seems likely that Newt was named after a goddess associated with nature because of his own ties to the animal kingdom.
