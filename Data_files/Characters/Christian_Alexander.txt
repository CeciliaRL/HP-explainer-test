==Etymology==
*"Christian" is from the Medieval Latin name 'Christianus' meaning "a Christian". In England it has been in use since the Middle Ages, during which time it was used by both males and females, but it did not become common until the 17th century.
*"Alexander" is from the personal name ''Alexander'', classical Greek ''Alexandros'', which probably originally meant ‘repulser of men (i.e. of the enemy)’, from ''alexein'' ‘to repel’ + ''andros'', genitive of ''aner'' ‘man’. Its popularity in the Middle Ages was due mainly to the Macedonian conqueror, Alexander the Great (356–323 bc)—or rather to the hero of the mythical versions of his exploits that gained currency in the so-called Alexander Romances.
