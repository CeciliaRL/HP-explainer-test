==Etymology==
The name "Daisy" is simply from the English word for the white flower, ultimately derived from Old English ''dægeseage'' meaning "day eye". It was first used as a given name in the 19th century, at the same time many other plant and flower names were coined.

==Behind the scenes==
*Daisy Dodderidge's ''Wizard of the Month'' entry and Chocolate Frog Card from the video games gives her dates as 1467-1555, but the Wizard of the Coast Chocolate Frog Cards lists them as 1457-1555.<ref name="WOTM"/><ref name="CFC"/><ref name="CFC2"/>
