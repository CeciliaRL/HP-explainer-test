'''George Osborne''' was a British politician and [[Wikipedia:Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer|Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the mid-to-late [[1990s]] (during [[Alistair Darling]]'s time as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]). In July of [[1996]], Darling announced "controversial changes" to the [[capital gains tax]]. As the protests grew louder, Osborne said his party would be campaigning to overturn this measure. These events were covered by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:TheGuardian.png|this image]])</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The listing of [[Wikipedia:George Osborne|George Osborne]] as the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1996 is anachronistic, as Osborne was only appointed to the office in [[2005]]. Indeed, at the time, [[Gordon Brown]] was the one who held the post.
