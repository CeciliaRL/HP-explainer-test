'''Face Paint Kid''' was the nickname of a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1980s]]. He preferred being known by that moniker rather than his birth name.

A huge fan of [[Quidditch]], he was known for testing other students' knowledge of the sport with what he called his "patented quidditch quiz" and for wearing elaborate face paint during matches. 

During the [[1985–1986 school year]], before [[Jacob's sibling]] attended their first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, he [[Face Paint Kid's patented Quidditch Quiz|quizzed]] them on their knowledge. Unfortunately, his face paint design for that match didn't turn out as he had hoped, but [[Penny Haywood]] helped him by using the [[Colour Change Charm]] to correct it to his [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] colours.<ref name="HM">{{HM}}</ref>

When Jacob's sibling became a [[Beater]] in the [[1986–1987 school year]] and a [[Keeper]] in the [[1987–1988 school year]], Face Paint Kid quizzed them two more times, each on [[Face Paint Kid's Beater Quidditch Quiz|Beater]] and [[Face Paint Kid's Keeper Quidditch Quiz|Keeper knowledge]].<ref name="HM3Q21">{{HM|3|Q2|1}}</ref><ref name="HM4Q31">{{HM|4|Q3|1}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*He is in whichever house the player chose for [[Jacob's sibling]].
*He likes nicknames.
*According to [[Penny Haywood]], Face Paint Kid is an even bigger [[Quidditch]] fan than she is, and creates the coolest face paint designs.
*Even though [[Jacob's sibling]] had just joined his 'Quidditch Fans' group and almost immediately the Quidditch Team, they became his favourite player.
