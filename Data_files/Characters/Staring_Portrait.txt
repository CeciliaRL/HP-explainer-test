There were two '''portraits of an eye''', hanging at [[Hogwarts Castle]]. They were capable of speech, although the subject's mouth was not visible in the painting.<ref name="OOTPG"/>

==History==
===1993-1994 school year===
By the [[1993–1994 school year]], both portraits were hung near the seventh-floor landing of the [[Grand Staircase]]. After the [[Fat Lady]] was attacked by [[Sirius Black]] in [[Hallowe'en]], the eyeballs could be seen staring at the ruined portrait frame.<ref name="POAF 13">{{POA|F}} - Chapter 13 (''Flight of the Fat Lady'')</ref>

===1995-1997===
Appalled by the lack of view at the [[Grand Staircase]], these portraits were moved by their own request to different locations: the [[Herbology corridor]]<ref name="OOTPG">{{OOTP|G}} - Console versions</ref> and the [[Middle Courtyard|Transfiguration Courtyard]].<ref name="op/gba">{{OOTP|G}} - GBA version</ref> Both portraits were hung next to portraits of [[Timothy the Timid]], to the latter's discomfort. Timothy was highly annoyed by the eyeballs' stare, and asked students to "''cover'' him ''up''", with paranoid claims that "''he is one of'' them". [[Harry Potter]], a fifth-year at the time, eventually obliged Timothy, covering the two portraits with both a bookcase (in the Transfiguration Courtyard) and a tapestry (in the Herbology Corridor).<ref name="OOTPG"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*This portrait was identified as "''Staring Portrait''" in the credits of the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game version]] of {{OOTP}}. It was voiced in the game by [[David Robb]].
