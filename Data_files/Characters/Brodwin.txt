==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Queen2.jpg|thumb|left|Brodwin, when flying]]
*In the short skit {{QH}}, Brodwin was sent to [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] when the Queen's Handbag went missing. The [[owl]] landed on a chair in the [[Gryffindor Tower|Gryffindor common room]] with the letter about the disappearance. Ron initially believed the letter came from the [[Minister for Magic]], however Hermione realised it actually came from the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Prime Minister]]. After watching Harry and Ron attempt to use a [[Summoning Charm]] to retrieve the handbag, the owl was given a letter from Hermione granting [[Buckingham Palace]] a temporary allowance of [[magic]] so they could [[Summoning Charm|summon]] the handbag themselves.
*Although this owl looks similar to Harry's owl [[Hedwig]], since Harry did not recognise it, it would seem to be a different owl. In the beginning of the skit, however, the owl is referred to as "Brodwin".
