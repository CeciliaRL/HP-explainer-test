'''Anthony Otterburn''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Hufflepuff]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].

==Biography==
He liked [[Herbology]], and could often be found in the second [[Hogwarts greenhouses|Herbology greenhouse]], as being around the plants made him feel calm. In [[1996]] he told [[Harry Potter]] that he could use ''[[Summoning Charm|Accio]]'' to collect the flower heads that he needed to make the [[Draught of Living Death]] for [[Potions (class)|Potions]].<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

Later in the year, he joined the [[Duelling Club (1990s)|Duelling Club]] run by [[Maynard Hatton]] in the [[Training Grounds]].<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Anthony" is from the English form of the Roman family name Antonius, which is of unknown Etruscan origin. The most notable member of the Roman family was the general Marcus Antonius (called Mark Antony in English), who for a period in the 1st century BC ruled the Roman Empire jointly with Augustus. When their relationship turned sour, he and his mistress Cleopatra were attacked and forced to commit suicide, as related in Shakespeare's tragedy 'Antony and Cleopatra' (1606).
