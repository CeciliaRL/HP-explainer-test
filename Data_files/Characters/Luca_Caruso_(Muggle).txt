==Etymology==
As a male given name, ''Luca'' is the Italian and Romanian form of ''Luke'', an English form of the Greek name ''Loukas'', meaning "from Lucania."<ref>"[http://www.behindthename.com/name/luca-1 Luca (1)]" on Behind the Name</ref><ref>"[http://www.behindthename.com/name/luke Luke]" on Behind the Name</ref> [[wikipedia:Lucania|Lucania]] was an ancient region of [[Italy|Southern Italy]] extending from the [[wikipedia:Tyrrhenian Sea|Tyrrhenian Sea]] to the [[wikipedia:Gulf of Taranto|Gulf of Taranto]].<ref>"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucania Lucania]" on Wikipedia</ref>

''Caruso'' is an Italian surname derived from the Italian word ''caruso'', "close-cropped," itself from the Latin ''cariosus'', "smooth" or "bald."<ref name="ancestry">"[http://www.ancestry.ca/name-origin?surname=caruso Caruso]" on Ancestry.com</ref> The word took on the broader meaning of "boy" in Italian, since, during the Middle Ages, when most men wore their hair longer, it was fashionable for young men to keep theirs short.<ref name="ancestry" /> ''Caruso'' also became an occupational name for sulphur pit workers in the [[wikipedia:Agrigento|Girgenti]] region of [[wikipedia:Sicily|Sicily]] because their job required short hair.<ref name="ancestry" />
