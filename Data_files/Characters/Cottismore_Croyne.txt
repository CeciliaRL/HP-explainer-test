'''Cottismore Croyne''', {{OM|}}, was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was appointed [[Supreme Mugwump]] of the [[International Confederation of Wizards]] sometime after [[Pierre Bonaccord]]. This was likely the reason he was awarded an [[Order of Merlin]].

==Biography==
Cottismore Croyne had a [[portrait]] of himself hung at [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] by the time [[Albus Dumbledore]], Supreme Mungwump himself in the [[1990s]], was [[Headmaster]] of the school. The portrait depicted him in one of the hallways in the [[Middle Courtyard]], which suggests that he may have visited [[Hogwarts Castle]] once.
