'''Sally Smith''' (c. [[1979]]-[[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. She was in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] and was sorted into either [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], or [[Slytherin]] house.

==Behind the scenes==
*Smith appeared on the student list shown by [[J. K. Rowling]] in {{HPM}}, but her given name was only partially visible, appearing to begin with "Ge-". On {{PM}}, Rowling revealed that the character's given name was originally "Georgina," but that this was crossed out and replaced with "Sally."<ref name="pottermore">{{PM}} (transcription available [http://lady-slytherin-forever.tumblr.com/post/8979923935/the-original-forty-off-pottermore here])</ref>
*It is possible Sally is one of the many unidentified Hufflepuff girls.
