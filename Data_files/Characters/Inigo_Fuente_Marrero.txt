==Etymology==
The name "Íñigo" is a [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] Spanish form of ''Eneko'', which means "ardent" or "fiery". Together with teammate [[Tiago Montoya]], the name may be a reference to Íñigo Montoya from the romantic comedy fantasy novel (and the [[wikipedia:The Princess Bride (film)|film]] adaptation) ''[[wikipedia:The Princess Bride|The Princess Bride]]''. It was also the birth name of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, who changed it in honour of Saint Ignatius of Antioch. As such, this name is sometimes regarded as a form of ''Ignatius''.

"Fuente" means "Fountain" in Spanish, and "Marrero" is an occupational name for a stone breaker ("''marrero''"), a derivative of "marra", which means "hammer".<ref name="ancestry">[http://www.ancestry.com/name-origin?view=1&surname=marrero Ancestry]</ref>
