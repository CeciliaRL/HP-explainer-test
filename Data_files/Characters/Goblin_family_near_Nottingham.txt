This '''family of [[goblin]]s''' lived somewhere near [[Nottingham]].<ref name="OOTP5"/>

==Biography==
During the [[First Wizarding War]], they were murdered by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]] for an unknown reason. [[Arthur Weasley]] recalled this event during a discussion about the loyalty of the goblin community with his son [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Remus Lupin]], citing this as the reason why the goblins might be against the current Voldemort regime.<ref name="OOTP5">{{OOTP|B|5}}</ref>
