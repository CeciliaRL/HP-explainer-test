'''Yusuf Kama''' (born c. [[1884]]) was a [[France|French]]-[[Africa]]n [[pure-blood]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] of [[Senegal]]ese ancestry, son of [[Laurena Kama|Laurena]] and [[Mustafa Kama]], and half-brother of [[Leta Lestrange]]. He claimed to be the last male in his [[pure-blood]] family line.<ref name="ss" />

==Biography==

===Early life (1884-1896)===

[[File:Yusuf Kama in his youth.png|150px|thumb|left|Yusuf Kama in his youth]]
Yusuf was born around 1884, the son of Mustafa and Laurena Kama, a pair of [[pure-blood]]ed wizards. They all lived in the [[Kama Mansion]].<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref> 

===Seeking vengeance (1896-1926)===
[[File:Young Yusuf with Laurena and Mustafa.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|12 years old Yusuf with his mother [[Laurena Kama|Laurena]] and father [[Mustafa Kama|Mustafa]]]]
Yusuf's parents were acquainted with [[Corvus Lestrange (IV)|Corvus Lestrange]], who desired Laurena. One night in [[1896]], he used the [[Imperius Curse]] to lure Laurena out of her home and abduct her. Yusuf tried to stop her from leaving, but Lestrange [[curse]]d him. That was the last time Yusuf saw his mother.<ref name="COGS"/>

Later he and his father learned that Laurena died giving birth to Lestrange's daughter [[Leta Lestrange|Leta]]. Mustafa became insane of grief and with his dying breath, he made Yusuf take an [[Unbreakable Vow]] to seek revenge by killing the person, who Lestrange loved most in the world.<ref name="COGS"/>

Yusuf first thought that his intended victim was Leta, since she was at the time Lestrange's only close relative, but he learned that Lestrange didn't love his daughter. But Yusuf learned that Lestrange married [[Clarisse Lestrange|Clarisse Tremblay]] soon after Laurena's death, and while Lestrange didn't love his wife either, he later, in [[1901]], had a son with her, named after himself, whom he loved more than anything. So [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus]] became Yusuf's target for revenge.<ref name="COGS"/>

Lestrange learned of Yusuf's vow of revenge and sent both his children with the servant [[Irma Dugard]] to America. Because of Irma's weak magic, Yusuf couldn't trace her and Corvus seemed to have escaped him.<ref name="COGS"/>

===Global wizarding war ([[1927]])===
====Search for Credence Barebone====
[[File:Yusuf in Circus Arcanus.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Yusuf watching Credence's and Nagini's escape]]
In [[1927]], Yusuf Kama was on a mission and tracked [[Credence Barebone]] to Paris. Yusuf was determent to track Credence down and kill him because he believed him to be [[Credence Barebone|Corvus Lestrange]], the son of [[Corvus Lestrange (IV)|Corvus Lestrange IV]] who had [[Imperius Curse|Imperiused]] Yusuf's mother into marriage. He had heard rumours about Credence's identity and managed to locate Credence at the [[Circus Arcanus]], where [[Nagini]], the [[Maledictus]], had a show. During Nagini's performance, Kama carefully observed the behaviour of [[Skender]], the circus owner provoking the woman. When Nagini turned into a snake, she attacked Skender. A moment later, as a result of Credence releasing animals from the cage, panic broke out in the circus and the crowd began to run away. Credence and Nagini [[Escape from Circus Arcanus|escaped]] from the circus, which prevented Yusuf from capturing the Obscurial. Hearing the conversation between the Auror, [[Porpentina Goldstein]] and Skender, he quickly realised that the topic of the conversation was Barebone. Therefore, when the woman finished talking, he invited her for [[tea]].<ref name="COGS"/>

====Meeting Tina Goldstein====
[[File:Yusuf talking with Tina.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Yusuf talking with Tina]]
During the meeting with Tina at a café, Yusuf told the woman that he was probably related to Credence. That the witch would believe him, he offered her that he would show reliable evidence that would determine his story. Kama lured Tina into his [[Yusuf Kama's hideout|hideout]] in the sewers to the chamber full of notes on the wall and a drawn family tree of the Lestrange family. He probably took the woman's wand and locked her there, so she wouldn't interfere with his mission.<ref name="COGS"/>

====Meeting Newt Scamander and Jacob Kowalski====
[[File:YusufExpelliarmus.gif|220x220px|thumb|Yusuf disarming Newt and locking him and Jacob with Tina]]
Yusuf returned to the [[Café Abringer|café]] where he had previously drunk tea with Goldstein. He went into the bathroom, and then instilled an eye in which there was a troublesome parasite. After leaving the interior of the cafe, he was accosted by [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] and [[Non-magic people|muggle]] [[Jacob Kowalski]], who asked him about their friend Tina. Initially, Yusuf answered evasively, but after a short while he decided to show men where the witch was. He led them to the sewers, and as soon as they entered, he [[Disarming Charm|disarmed]] Newton and locked him and Jacob in the chamber with Porpentina.<ref name="COGS"/>
[[File:Jacob with unconscious Yusuf.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Jacob holding unconscious Yusuf]]
Yusuf promptly leaves, but not before promising to his captives that he will return and set them free once he has concluded his business with Credence; a business wherein either the boy dies, or Yusuf himself does should the latter fail in his endeavour. A moment later, the African-French wizard began to sweat intensively from the [[Water dragon parasite|parasite]] and had a seizure<ref>{{AM}}</ref> leading to him fainting. With the help of the Newt's [[Bowtruckle]], [[Pickett]], who could open the locks, all three got out of the previously closed room. Hearing the prowling on the streets Zouwu, Newt, Tina and Jacob transported Kama and moved to the [[Alexander III Bridge]]. Scamander tamed the creature with a [[Cat bird toy|toy]], while Tina and Jacob were guarding the unconscious Yusuf at that time. When Zouwu got into the suitcase, the card Newt received from [[Albus Dumbledore]] in [[London]] showed him the direction in which they should go. So they took Yusuf and went in the designated direction.<ref name="COGS"/>

====At Nicholas Flamel's house====
[[File:Jacob with unconscious Yusuf at Flamel's house.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Yusuf with Jacob at Flamel's house]]
Yusuf lay unconscious in [[Flamel House]] for a short period. During this time he was examined by Tina, who said that the man probably took an [[Unbreakable Vow]]. When the witch wanted to question him, believing that he knew where Credence was, the [[Water dragon parasite|parasite]] in Kama's eye began to move. Newt pulled it out with tweezers, which caused Yusuf to awake for a moment. He said then that "he must kill" and after a while he lost consciousness again.<ref name="COGS"/>

====Revelation in the Lestrange Family Mausoleum====
[[File:Yusuf trying to kill Credence.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Yusuf trying to kill Credence]]
As soon as the wizard awoke, he jumped to his feet and fled from Flamel's apartment, heading towards the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]] on [[Cimetière du Père-Lachaise|Pere Lachaise cemetery]]. Soon after, Jacob, Credence and Nagini arrived, with Yusuf holding the Muggle at wandpoint. After a while, Newt, Tina and Leta Lestrange were also found in the tomb. Yusuf announced to the audience that Credence was Leta's half-brother. Kama told about his past: how Corvus Lestrange enchanted his mother Laurena, and then the woman gave birth to his daughter Leta. Yusuf also admitted that he planned to kill Leta, fulfilling the promise made to his father Mustafa, but he changed his goal to Credence when he learned that Corvus begot another child he truly loved. This child was Credence, who was initially named after his biological father, Corvus. After telling the story, Kama said that he would complete his Unbreakable Vow, and then pulled out his [[Yusuf Kama's wand|wand]], which he aimed at Barebone. Seeing the intentions of the African-French wizard, Leta shouted that Corvus was dead and that she had unintentionally killed him. The witch told the story of the adoption of Corvus, in which she participated: during a boat trip at sea there was a storm that forced passengers to evacuate to lifeboats. Leta swapped the baby, wanting to free herself from her brother. With an unknown child and [[Irma Dugard]], [[Part elf|half-elf]] maid, got on the boat and sailed away, watching other boats get sunk, including the one in which she had changed her brother. The conversation was interrupted by opening of the door to the next chamber, in which [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|Gellert Grindelwald's rally]] began.<ref name="COGS"/>

====Battle in the Lestrange Family Mausoleum====
[[File:Yusuf fighting with flames.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Yusuf fighting with Grindelwald's flames]]
Yusuf went to a meeting of [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s supporters, which took place in the mausoleum. During the rally, Yusuf witnessed the wizard's speech and vision of the [[Second World War|World War II]] that Grindelwald had presented. Shortly after the Aurors squadron under the command of [[Theseus Scamander]] has arrived and [[Red-haired young witch|pure-blood witch]] has been killed in self-defence by [[Cassius Bell|one of them]]. Grindelwald sent his followers to spread the word and began the fight by [[Protego Diabolica|conjuring a circle of black fire]] to divide friend from foe. Credence passed successfully, as did [[Queenie Goldstein]], Tina's younger sister and Jacob's fiancee. Yusuf also was a witness of his half-sister's death, because when Grindelwald attacked both Scamander brothers, Leta interfered and sacrificed herself to allow Yusuf and others time to escape from mausoleum. Kama grabbed Nagini, forcing her to Disapparate outside the mausoleum.<ref name="COGS"/>

Grindelwald fled the scene, but before he did, he unleashed deadly fire to destroy Paris. Yusuf, the Scamander brothers, Tina, Jacob and Nagini were powerless, but luckily [[Nicolas Flamel]] converged upon the cemetery to instruct Kama and the other wizards to use the [[General Counter-Spell]] to prevent Grindelwald's flames. Kama listened the alchemist and stuck his wand into the ground and helped to stop the fire. Yusuf, shocked by the events of the evening, was unable to make a word of himself.<ref name="COGS"/>

====Travel to Hogwarts====
[[File:Hogwarts Entrance TCOG.jpeg|220x220px|thumb|left|Yusuf and others at Hogwarts]]
Yusuf along with other survivors travelled to Hogwarts, where he witnessed Newt Scamander's conversation with Albus Dumbledore. He was probably aware of the purpose of the visit. From a distance of several metres he watched the discussion of Newt, who after a while was invited by Albus for a tea. Nagini was wearing his coat, so he presumably lent it to her for comfort.<ref name="COGS"/>

==Personality and traits==
[[File:Yusuf in sewers.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Yusuf in his hideout]]
Yusuf Kama was extremely ambitious, cunning, and resourceful, shown in his determination to track down and kill [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus Lestrange]] to fulfil the [[Unbreakable Vow]] which his father, [[Mustafa Kama]], had forced him to make. Indeed, Yusuf was so desperate to complete this mission, that he tricked and trapped [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]], and [[Jacob Kowalski]], and later even ruthlessly threatened to kill Jacob if the [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] was to get in his way. Moreover, Yusuf was notably cunning enough to trick even the highly skilled [[Auror]] Tina.<ref name="COGS"/>

Despite Yusuf's occasional ruthlessness, however, he had a softer side and was capable of genuine love and had a decent degree of morals and empathy. Yusuf deeply loved his mother [[Laurena Kama]] and his father and was devastated by the tragedy that separated them. Although he was determined to kill Corvus, Yusuf seemed to pity the young man who he thought was Corvus V for his fated doom caused by his apparent father's actions. He didn't want to kill anyone else and demanded them to move. Moreover, despite his pride in being a pure-blood wizard, Yusuf was not a [[Pure-blood supremacy|Pure-blood supremacist]]. While willing to trap Newt, Jacob, and Tina after completing his mission, Yusuf wanted to release them after he killed Corvus V. Yusuf also seemed to harbour no ill will towards his half-sister [[Leta Lestrange]], and even seemed to love her in a way, even hesitating before stating that her father [[Corvus Lestrange (IV)]] had never loved her (apparently not wishing to hurt Leta's feelings).<ref name="COGS"/>

After learning that his Vow was void (due to Corvus already being dead), Yusuf started to display a more moral and selfless side - not being tempted by Grindelwald's persuasive speech, risking his life to save [[Nagini]] from the black fire, and then helping [[Nicolas Flamel]], as well as his former situational enemies, by conjuring purifying orange flames. Inspired by the selfless sacrifice his half-sister Leta, Yusuf officially joined the [[Global wizarding war]] on the side opposing Grindelwald, and journeyed to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] to meet with [[Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name="COGS"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': Yusuf Kama was shown to be an accomplished and rather powerful [[Wizardkind|wizard]], as he was confident in his ability to [[Killing Curse|kill]] the immensely dangerous [[Credence Barebone]], in order to fulfil the [[Unbreakable Vow]] his father had forced him to give. Yusuf also successfully aided [[Nicolas Flamel]], [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], [[Theseus Scamander]] and [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] in saving Paris from the incredibly destructive [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]] conjured by [[Gellert Grindelwald]].<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Yusuf was highly skilled at fending off [[Dark Arts|Dark Magic]], as seen when he was able to quickly follow [[Nicolas Flamel]]'s instructions on how to cast the [[General Counter-Spell]] necessary to contain and extinguish the violent black fire left by Gellert Grindelwald, and thus helped to prevent the destruction of Paris.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Yusuf was apparently highly capable in Charms, since he swiftly and effortlessly cast the [[Disarming Charm]] to disarm Newt Scamander of his [[Newton Scamander's wand|wand]]. Moreover, Yusuf only failed to track down [[Corvus Lestrange (V)]] prior to the shipwreck due to [[Irma Dugard]]'s barely detectable half-elf magic, showing he was proficient with tracking charms.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Yusuf was able to swiftly [[Conjuration|conjure]] [[Bar conjuring spell|bars]] through a doorway, trapping [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] and [[Jacob Kowalski]], along with [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]], in a chamber.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Divination]]''' : Yusuf had some knowledge of this very subjective and esoteric branch of magic, given his great familiarity with [[The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus]].<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Yusuf had at least some skill in this field, given his ability to effectively keep the [[Water dragon parasite]] in his eye at bay with [[Bright green liquid|magical eye-drops]]. However, Yusuf's treatments did not prevent the parasite from incapacitating him suddenly, while Newt was able to extract it from Yusuf's eye in mere seconds.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Love]]''': Yusuf deeply loved his parents, being devastated at the loss of his beloved mother [[Laurena Kama]] to [[Corvus Lestrange (IV)]], and agreeing with his father [[Mustafa Kama]]'s order to give an [[Unbreakable Vow]] to avenge his family's ruin by killing the one Corvus IV most loved. While not getting much time to know his half-sister [[Leta Lestrange]], Yusuf loved her too in a way, sympathising with that fact that she wasn't loved by her own father. He is fair enough to not blame Leta for their mother's death. Indeed, Yusuf seemingly resolved to honour Leta's memory by joining the side opposing [[Gellert Grindelwald]] in the [[Global wizarding war]].<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Yusuf, like most adult wizards, could Apparate at will, though he seemed more skilled than most, as he Apparated away from the black fire left by Grindelwald, while also saving [[Nagini]] in the process.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Yusuf was very skilled at nonverbal magic, with him conjuring bars through a doorway without uttering any [[incantation]].<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''Detective skills''': Yusuf had immense skills in tracking and deduction, since he tracked down [[Credence Barebone]] to the [[Circus Arcanus]] just as quickly as the highly skilled MACUSA Auror [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] did. Yusuf was later able to track down Credence and [[Nagini]] again, this time to the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]].<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''Indomitable willpower''': Yusuf possessed immense willpower and bravery, with him resisting [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]]'s persuasive speech, instead valiantly fighting against the Dark Wizard's [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]], and, inspired by his half-sister [[Leta Lestrange|Leta]]'s sacrifice, joining the [[Global wizarding war]] against Grindelwald.<ref name="COGS"/>
*'''Bilingualism:''' Yusuf, due to his Senegalese heritage, fluently spoke both his native French and English, though he had a slight accent in the latter.<ref name="COGS"/>

==Etymology==
*Yusuf is the Arabic equivalent to Joseph, meaning "God increases in piety, power, and influence" in Hebrew.
**It is also the name of a prophet in the Qu'ran, the only one of Jacob's/Yaacob's children gifted with prophecy. He was Jacob's eleventh child, and was considered his favourite.
*Kama is a Sanskrit name meaning "love."

==Behind the scenes==
*Yusuf Kama is played by [[William Nadylam]] in {{COG}}.<ref name="EW">[https://ew.com/movies/2018/10/15/pottermore-excerpt-fantastic-beasts-yusuf-kama/ Entertainment Weekly]</ref> Nadylam will reprise the role in the upcoming {{SOD}}.
*[[Isaac Domingos]] played 12-year-old Yusuf in a flashback to [[Laurena Kama|Laurena]]'s abduction.
*It is possible that Yusuf Kama, if [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] had obtained and maintained the Elder Wand's allegiance by that time, may have temporarily become Master of the [[Elder Wand]] in {{COG}}, as the Elder Wand switches allegiance when its Master is overpowered. Since Yusuf Kama, by disarming and imprisoning Newt, overpowered him beyond resistance, it's possible that the Elder Wand perceived in Kama a superior level of (real) power. If Kama did in fact become the Elder Wand's Master, then, following the events of the saga, Grindelwald would have to directly (or indirectly) gain the Elder Wand's allegiance back, before his final duel with [[Albus Dumbledore]].
{{Quoteurl|At the start he [Yusuf] was a character who transformed into an animal. There was a lot more prosthetic work, so it amused me a lot. I already saw myself transforming into a bird, etc. And when I was told that we were removing this part, I was a little sad at first. I said to myself, oh dear, I would have no superpower. But in fact it was to make the character more human, more engaging, and to deepen his humanity. And after that was the gift.|William Nadylam|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHmvyLnXLpA}}
*During the start, before ideas were being cut, Yusuf was going to be an [[Animagus]].
