'''Urquhart''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]], who was a member of [[Slytherin]] house.

==Biography==
During the [[1996–1997 school year]], he was the [[Quidditch Captain#Hogwarts Quidditch Captains|Captain]] of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]]. Urquhart was new to the squad and he had not held any position on the team before, so it seemed odd that he was made the Captain, playing as a [[Chaser]]. During the match against Gryffindor, Urquhart shook hands with Harry, 'crushing it'.<ref name="HBP14">{{HBP|B|14}}</ref>
