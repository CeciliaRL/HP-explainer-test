'''Sir Winston Leonard Spencer-Churchill''' ([[30 November]], [[1874]] – [[24 January]], [[1965]]) was the Muggle [[Prime Minister (title)|Prime Minister]] from [[10 May]], [[1940]] to [[26 July]], [[1945]] and again from [[26 October]], [[1951]] to [[6 April]], [[1955]]. Churchill was widely regarded as one of the greatest wartime leaders, due to Britain's involvement in the [[Second World War]].<ref name="Wikipedia">[[Wikipedia:Winston Churchill|"Winston Churchill"]] on [[Wikipedia:Main page|Wikipedia]]</ref>

Winston Churchill enjoyed a good working relationship with the [[Minister for Magic]], [[Leonard Spencer-Moon]], as they oversaw a period of great international turmoil in both the wizarding ([[global wizarding war]]) and the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] world ([[Second World War]]).<ref name="PMministers">{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>
