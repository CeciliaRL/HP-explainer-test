'''Alistair Darling''' was a British politician and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the mid-to-late [[1990s]]. In July of [[1996]], Darling announced "controversial changes" to the [[capital gains tax]]. As the protests grew louder, shadow chancellor [[George Osborne]] said his party would be campaigning to overturn this measure. These events were covered by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:TheGuardian.png|this image]])</ref> He was also one of the many people who attempted to have the [[portrait in the Prime Minister's office]] removed, although he like all of the others failed to do so.

==Behind the scenes==
*The listing of [[Wikipedia:Alistair Darling|Alistair Darling]] as the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1996 is anachronistic, as Darling was only appointed to the office in [[2007]]. Indeed, at the time, was a member of [[Wikipedia:Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]'s Shadow Cabinet as the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
