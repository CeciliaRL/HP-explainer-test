==Biography==
During their match against [[Welsh National Quidditch team|Wales]], he attempted the life-threatening [[Wronski Feint]]. However, he failed to pull out in time and collided with the ground at what onlookers estimated to be sixty miles an hour. [[Healer]]s immediately flooded the [[Quidditch pitch|Pitch]] and administered [[Skele-Gro]]. According to the team manager [[Franziska Faust]], Pfeffer was likely to make a complete recovery, though he had broken most of his bones and believed himself to be a [[budgerigar]] called Klaus.<ref name="PM">[[WALES VERSUS GERMANY]] (Archived from {{PM}})</ref>
