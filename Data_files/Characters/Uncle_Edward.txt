}}'''Uncle Edward''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[poltergeist]] who haunted a [[New York]] [[wizardkind|wizarding]] family.<ref name="dec6sunrise">{{FB|F}} {{See image|File:The New York Ghost - 6 Dec 1926 - Sunrise Early Edition.png}}</ref>

Although usually calm in temperament, one day in [[1926]] he had an argument with the family he haunted during a [[picnic]] in [[Central Park]], and proceeded to throw baked goods at passing [[Muggles|No-Majs]], disappearing afterwards.<ref name="dec6sunrise" /> The incident was reported in the [[6 December]] 1926 morning edition of ''[[The New York Ghost]]'' as possibly jeopardising [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|wizarding secrecy]].<ref name="dec6sunrise" />
