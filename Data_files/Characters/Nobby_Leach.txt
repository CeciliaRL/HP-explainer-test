'''Minister Nobby Leach''' was the [[Great Britain|British]] [[Minister for Magic]] between [[1962]] and [[1968]]. He was the first [[Muggle-born]] [[Minister for Magic]] to ever hold office.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Leach was born into a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] family in [[Great Britain]], sometime in or prior to [[1945]]. He was somehow trained in the [[magic]]al arts and eventually managed to become the [[Minister for Magic]] for Britain and [[Ireland]], being elected at least once.

===As Minister for Magic===
In [[1962]], Leach was the first [[Muggle-born]] to be appointed to the post of [[Minister for Magic]]. Several of the oldest members of the [[Wizengamot]] resigned government posts in protest of his appointment.<ref name="PM">{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref> Though Leach was believed to have played a part in England's 1966 World Cup Win, he denied these claims, stating that he had no part whatsoever.<ref name="PM" /> He left his post in [[1968]] due to a shady plot, of which [[Abraxas Malfoy]] was believed part<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|the-malfoy-family}}</ref>, that resulted in his contracting a mysterious illness.<ref name="PM" />

==Etymology==
*''Nobby ''is a diminutive form of the name ''Norbert'', meaning both "north" and "bright".
*''Leach ''could refer to a sub-class of worm and an ingredient in [[Polyjuice Potion]], [[leech|the leech]]. Surname from a mediæval doctor (reference to use of leeches in bloodletting).
