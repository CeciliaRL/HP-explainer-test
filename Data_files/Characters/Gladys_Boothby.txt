'''Gladys Boothby''' was a [[broom-maker]] known for creating the [[Moontrimmer]] in [[1901]]. She was a skilled broom-maker, as her Moontrimmer could achieve greater heights then other period brooms while still remaining controllable. The Moontrimmer's popularly overwhelmed Boothby, however, and she went out of business when she became unable to keep up with demand, a common problem among broom-makers of the period.<ref>{{QTA|R|9}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Gladys" is from the old Welsh name ''Gwladus'', possibly derived from ''gwlad'' "country". It has historically been used as a Welsh form of ''Claudia''. This name became popular outside of Wales after it was used in Ouida's novel 'Puck' (1870).
