===Career===
Sometime in or before [[1997]], he was employed by the [[British Ministry of Magic]]. Sometime that year, [[Ronald Weasley|Reginald Cattermole]] overheard the wizard talking about the [[Taboo]] [[curse]] that had been placed on [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s name.<ref>{{DH|F1}} {{Deleted scenes|Tent}}</ref> Hence, it is possible that he was close to the Voldemort or the [[Death Eaters]], given that otherwise he'd likely be too scared to speak of the curse on the former's name.
