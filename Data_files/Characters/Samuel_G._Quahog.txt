'''President Samuel G.

==Biography==
Following the American victory over [[Liechtenstein National Quidditch team|Liechtenstein]] on the quarter-finals of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]], the Liechtenstein mascot, a large and gloomy [[Augurey]] called [[Hans]], was kidnapped by high-spirited American fans celebrating their team's historic triumph.<ref name="PM8June">{{PM}} - [http://www.pottermore.com/en/daily-prophet/qwc2014/2014-06-08/late-breaking-news New from J.K. Rowling: "''LATE BREAKING NEWS''" (''Evening Prophet'', 08 June 2014)]</ref> Hans was put back in his customised pen the following day, [[9 June]] [[2014]], but not before negotiations for his return reached the highest levels: the Liechtenstein Minister for Magic [[Otto Obermeier]] and President Samuel G. Quahog had to exchange terse owls so that the bird was returned home. Even though President Quahog termed it was done in a "''friendly and cooperative fashion''", Minister Obermeier insisted that if any ill effects were discovered on [[Hans]], Liechtenstein would "''of course lobby the [[International Confederation of Wizards' Quidditch Committee|ICWQC]] for the USA's immediate disqualification from the World Cup''".<ref name="PM9June"/>
