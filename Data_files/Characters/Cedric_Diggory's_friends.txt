This '''group of students''' were four boys and a girl and were [[Cedric Diggory]]'s friends, and was often seen with him.

==Biography==
During the [[1994â€“1995 school year]], at some point, they were going to [[Charms (class)|Charms class]], when Cedric's bag split open, due to [[Harry Potter]] casting the [[Severing Charm]] on it, in order for him to speak to him privately. They tried to pick his things up, but Cedric told them to go ahead and tell [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] that he would be late.<ref name="GOF20">{{GOF|B|20}}</ref> They, understandably, resented Harry Potter for being the ''second'' Hogwarts champion in the [[Triwizard Tournament]], and so stealing their friend's limelight, in their eyes.
