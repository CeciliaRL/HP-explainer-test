'''Louise''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and student who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the [[1990s]]. During the [[1996-1997 school year]], [[Harry Potter]] was asked by another student to make a [[potion]] for the student, as Louise had been asking for it. Harry successfully brewed the potion and gave it to the boy, who was delighted and claimed that Louise would ''"definitely go out with me now."''<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>
