==Etymology==
*The name "Gianna" is a short form of the Italian "Giovanna", which is a female form of "Giovanni", the Italian form of John. It means "God is gracious".
*The name "Grace" comes from the English word grace, which ultimately derives from Latin gratia. This was one of the virtue names created in the 17th century by the Puritans. The actress Grace Kelly (1929-1982) was a famous bearer.
*"Marie" is a French surname from the given name "Marie", which is a form of the name Mary.
