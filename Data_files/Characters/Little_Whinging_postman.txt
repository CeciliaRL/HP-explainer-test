This '''individual''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] postman, whose route in [[Little Whinging]] included [[Privet Drive]]. In the summer of [[1994]], the postman delivered a [[Molly Weasley's letter to Vernon and Petunia Dursley|letter]] to the [[Dursley family]], although he chose to ring the doorbell and deliver the letter personally instead of leaving it in the mailbox. The letter in question had been sent by [[Molly Weasley]], who chose to use [[Muggle Mail|Muggle post]] instead of an [[owl]], and was absolutely covered in postage stamps save for a small space where she had written their address. The postman had found this as rather amusing, although [[Vernon Dursley]] did not.<ref name="GOF3">{{GOF|B|3}}</ref>
