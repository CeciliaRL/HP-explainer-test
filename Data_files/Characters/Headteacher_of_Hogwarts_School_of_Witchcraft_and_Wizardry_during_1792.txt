{{Quote|Well, the [[Headmaster|Heads]] of the participating schools are always on the panel, because all three of them were injured during the [[Triwizard Tournament|Tournament]] of [[1792]], when a [[cockatrice]] the champions were supposed to be catching went on the rampage.

This '''individual''' was the [[Headmaster|Headteacher]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during the [[1790s]].<ref name="GF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref>

==Biography==
In 1792, the [[Triwizard Tournament]] was held at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts Castle]], and this Headteacher welcomed the [[Headteacher of Beauxbatons Academy of Magic during 1792|Head of Beauxbatons]] and [[Headmaster of Durmstrang Institute during 1792|Durmstrang]] to [[Scotland]]. One of the tasks involved catching a [[Cockatrice]], which went on a rampage and injured the judges, including the Hogwarts Head.<ref name="GF15"/> This incident, along with the rising number of deaths during the tournament, was a contributing factor to the eventual termination of the Tournament, though there were a few unsuccessful attempts to revive it.

==Behind the scenes==
*If this individual was [[Dilys Derwent]]'s immediate successor, he/she would have been Head since [[1768]].
