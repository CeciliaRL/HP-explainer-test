'''Mr Prewett''' was an [[England|English]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and a member of the [[Prewett family]].

==Biography==
He was the brother of [[Ignatius Prewett]].<ref>[[Sirius Black]] stated in {{OOTP|B|6}} that Molly Weasley was his "cousin by marriage". This means that Ignatius could not have been Molly, Fabian, and Gideon's father, as this would have made them first cousins by blood of Sirius [false logic: this merely means that Lucretia Black Prewett (Ignatius' wife) could not have been their mother]. Ignatius was Sirius's uncle by marriage, and if Molly was his niece, this could explain Sirius's comment. See this [[Talk:Ignatius Prewett|talk page]] for more information.</ref> the husband of [[Molly Weasley's mother|Mrs Prewett]], and the father of [[Molly Weasley|Molly Weasley née Prewett]], and [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]]. He was the maternal grandfather of the [[Weasley family|Weasley]] children. He was also the father-in-law of [[Arthur Weasley]]. He could also possibly be the nephew of [[Muriel]].

He may have owned a [[Wizard's Chess]] set<ref name="PS12">{{PS|B|12}}: Ron's chess set is stated as belonging to his grandfather, but it does not say whether it was his maternal grandfather or his paternal grandfather.</ref> and may also have had a big nose.<ref>[http://e-card.51.net/movie.scripts/Harry.Potter/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban.htm| Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (script)]: Fred states that George's nose looks "positively massive" and is corrected that it is his - he says it is a family trait from Molly, implying that one of Molly's parents had a big nose too, though it is unknown as to which parents did.</ref>
