{{Quote|No one wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he did save a village from werewolves. He'd look dreadful on the front cover. No dress sense at all.|Gilderoy Lockhart|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
An '''Armenian warlock''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who saved an entire village from a group of [[Werewolf|werewolves]], including possibly the [[Wagga Wagga Werewolf]]. [[Gilderoy Lockhart]] took credit for it and wrote a book, titled ''[[Wanderings with Werewolves]]'', in which he claimed to have saved the village himself. Lockhart erased this [[warlock]]'s memory with a [[Memory Charm]] to prevent him from ''"blabbing"''. Lockhart described him as "ugly" and "old" with "no dress sense".<ref name="COS16">{{COS|B|16}}</ref>
