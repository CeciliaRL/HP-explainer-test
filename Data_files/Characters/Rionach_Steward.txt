{{Quote|Rionach never married or had children, as rumour had it that she had the ability to speak [[Parseltongue]] like her ancestor [[Salazar Slytherin]], and did not want his powers to be passed down any further.|Rionach's rumour to be a Parselmouth|Pottermore}}
'''Rionach Steward '''(b. [[1600s]]) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[half-blood]]<ref name="Blood"/> [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the younger twin daughter of [[Isolt Sayre]] and [[James Steward]]. Isolt and James were the founders of [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. Rionach would later become one of the school's first [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] instructors, teaching there for many years.<ref name="PottermoreIlvermorny">{{WW|ilvermorny}}</ref>

Rionach chose not to marry and remained single. There was a rumour she was born with the ability to speak [[Parseltongue]], and because of this was determined not to pass on [[Slytherin]] ancestry into the next generation, thus her decision to never marry.<ref name="PottermoreIlvermorny" />

==Biography==
Rionach Steward was born in or around [[1634]] at [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]] in Massachusetts, along with her older fraternal twin sister, [[Martha Steward II|Martha]]. Her parents, [[Isolt Sayre]], a [[pure-blood]] [[wizardkind|witch]], and [[James Steward]], a [[Muggle|No-Maj]], were the founders of the school. She also had two older brothers by adoption: [[Chadwick Boot|Chadwick]] and [[Webster Boot]]. She was named after her late [[Rionach Sayre|maternal grandmother]].<ref name="PottermoreIlvermorny" />

Rionach was [[Magic genes|born]] with [[magic]]al abilities, whereas her elder twin was born a [[Squib]].<ref name="PottermoreIlvermorny" /> It was also rumoured — though it was never confirmed by the family — that she was born a [[Parseltongue|Parselmouth]], a frequent trait in her [[House of Gaunt|maternal family]], descendants of [[Salazar Slytherin]] (sometimes known to his contemporaries as "Serpent-tongue").<ref name="CS11">{{COS|B|11}}</ref><ref name="PottermoreIlvermorny" />

When she was a baby, her great-aunt, [[Gormlaith Gaunt]], attacked the family due to her [[Pure-blood supremacy|prejudice against Muggles]]. Her parents had been put in [[Gormlaith Gaunt's curse|a deep sleep]] by Gormlaith, but the cries of baby Rionach and her sister Martha woke them, since the curse took no account of the power of [[love]]. The family were saved by [[William (Pukwudgie)|William]], the [[Pukwudgie]] her mother had befriended several years earlier.<ref name="PottermoreIlvermorny" />

Rionach went on to become the teacher of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] at [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]]. She never married or had children, determined not to let the [[Slytherin family|Slytherin]] and [[House of Gaunt|Gaunt]] bloodlines to continue (which was ultimately fruitless, since the American branch of the family was unaware that Gormlaith was not the last of the Gaunts in England).<ref name="PottermoreIlvermorny" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Rionach was very talented in defensive [[magic]], as she went on to become a [[professor]] of Defence Against the Dark Arts at [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], showing her talent and knowledge in this field.<ref name="PottermoreIlvermorny" />
*'''[[Parseltongue]] (possibly)''': Rionach was rumoured by some, but never proven, to have possessed the rare ability of Parseltongue, the ability to speak to [[snake]]s. Some alleged her supposedly being a Parselmouth led her to not have any children in her lifetime, but whether or not she actually was a Parselmouth in reality, is unknown.<ref name="PottermoreIlvermorny" />

==Etymology==
*Rionach is a variant of the name Ríoghnach, derived from Irish ríoghan meaning "queen". In Irish legend this was a wife of the Irish king Niall.

*The surname steward comes from Middle English ''steward'', from Old English ''stīweard'', ''stīġweard'' ‎meaning “steward, housekeeper, one who has the superintendence of household affairs, guardian”, from ''stīġ'' in the sense ''house'', ''hall'' + ''weard''  ‎“ward, guard, guardian, keeper”.

== Behind the scenes ==

*Although Rionach decided not to marry, [[Martha Steward II|her sister]] did, so there may still be descendants of [[Salazar Slytherin]] via Martha. It is possible that Rionach did not want to impose her choice on her sister as well, or that she tried but failed.
**However Martha was a [[squib]], and she married [[Martha Steward II's husband|a man without magical powers]]. The fact that [[magic]] can resurface in the squib's descendants is a recent discovery, so it's possible that Rionach hasn't made any opposition to her sister's marriage.
