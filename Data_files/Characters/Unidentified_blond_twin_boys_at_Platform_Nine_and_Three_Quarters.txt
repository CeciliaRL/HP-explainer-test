These '''twin boys''' appeared on [[Platform Nine and Three-Quarters]] in [[King's Cross]] on [[1 September|September 1]], [[2017]] examining on their pet [[owl]] when the students were getting on the [[Hogwarts Express]].<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*They could be [[Lorcan and Lysander]] Scamander, [[Luna Lovegood|Luna]]'s kids, since they are blonde like her, but if they were, Luna would probably have been there too and then greeted [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny]].
*However, there is also possible that if they are indeed Lorcan and Lysander, it is possible that their they had arrived earlier and already had left, with their siblings already on the train.
