{{Quote|Do you know there's a wizard, in Nepal, who's growing [[gravity-resistant tree]]s|[[Neville Longbottom]] to [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)}}
A '''[[Wizardkind|wizard]]''' from [[Nepal]], with some [[Herbology]] skill, bred [[gravity-resistant tree]]s. He was notable enough to be included in [[Goshawk's Guide to Herbology]] by [[Miranda Goshawk]] by [[1994]], although any activity in the field since that time is unknown.<ref name="GOFF">{{GOF|F}} - Chapter 22 (''The Second Task'')</ref>
