==Behind the scenes==
*This character is mentioned only on an award certificate seen in the "[[Gilderoy Lockhart|Lockhart's Office]]" feature on Disc 2 of the ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' DVD. The prop award certificate appears to be partially constructed from a membership certificate for a real historical organisation called the Ladies' League for the Defence of the Reformed Faith of the Church of England. This group was founded in 1899 by a Lady Wimborne and advocated against [[Wikipedia:Ritualism|ritualism]] in the [[Wikipedia:Church of England|Anglican Church]].<ref>[http://books.google.ca/books?id=55aaZGqqh6oC&pg=PA317&lpg=PA317&dq=%22Ladies'+League+for+the+defence+of+the%22+wimborne&source=bl&ots=Pr8Imf7miA&sig=5t24pE6dgarlSIdMuZoWwuR0tNY&hl=en&ei=YUtZSrmSL5PYtAP-y8XBBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2 ''Anglican ritualism in Victorian Britain, 1830-1910''] by Nigel Yates</ref>
