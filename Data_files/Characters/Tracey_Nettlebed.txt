'''Tracey Nettlebed''' was a [[Slytherin]] [[wizardkind|student]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

==Biography==
Several students stated that she was willing to ''"dish the dirt on anyone"'' if what she gained in return was to her satisfaction. In keeping with this assessment, in [[1996]] she agreed to tell [[Harry Potter]] what she knew about [[Draco Malfoy]]'s activities in the [[Seventh-floor corridor]] in exchange for a [[Skiving Snackbox]], which she planned to use to skip [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] (a subject she described as ''"stupid"''). She warned Harry not to tell anyone about what she told him.
