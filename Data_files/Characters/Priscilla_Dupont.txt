'''Minister Priscilla Dupont''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the [[Minister for Magic]] from [[1855]] to [[17 February]], [[1858]].  She was elected Minister likely only once.<ref name="PM">{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>

==Biography==
Dupont was elected as the [[Minister for Magic]] of [[Great Britain]] in [[1855]]. Upon her accession to the office, she developed an irrational loathing of the [[Prime Minister (title)|Muggle Prime Minister]], [[Lord Palmerston]]. This attained such proportions that it ended up in her being forced to step down on [[17 February]], [[1858]], after such incidents as [[Muggle money|coins]] [[Coins to frogspawn spell|turning]] to [[frogspawn]] in Lord Palmerston's coat pockets. Ironically, Palmerston was forced to resign by the Muggles two days later on [[19 February]].<ref name="PM"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Dupont possessed a degree of proficiency in this branch of [[magic]], as she was capable of [[Coins to frogspawn spell|turning]] coins into [[frogspawn]] in the pockets of [[Lord Palmerston]] successfully.<ref name="PM"/>
