This '''[[Potions (class)|Potions]] [[Professor]]''' (fl. [[16th century]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard or witch]] who taught at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during [[Zygmunt Budge]]'s school days.<ref name="BOP" />

==Biography==
They had apparently been teaching at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] for a long time, as Budge described this Professor as "ancient".<ref name="BOP">{{WBP}}</ref>

When needing wild, uncontrollable laughter for his [[Laughing Potion]], Budge often thought of an incident where a rival student of his spilled [[Love Potion]] onto himself, thus becoming attracted to this Professor. In Budge's opinion, this was the most humorous occurrence he had ever witnessed.<ref name="BOP" />

By the age of fourteen, Budge was able to correct this Professor on the proper usage of [[Mackled Malaclaw]] [[Mackled Malaclaw tail|tails]] in [[Potion|Potion-making]].<ref name="BOP" />
