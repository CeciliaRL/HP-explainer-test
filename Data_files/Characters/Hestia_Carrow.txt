==Biography==

===1996-1997 school year===
{{Quote|The ceiling and walls had been draped with emerald, crimson and gold hangings, so that it looked as though they were all inside a vast tent. The room was crowded and stuffy and bathed in the red light cast by an ornate golden lamp dangling from the centre of the ceiling in which real fairies were fluttering, each a brilliant speck of light.|Slug Club Christmas party that Hestia attended|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}

Hestia was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] along with her identical twin sister, [[Flora Carrow|Flora]], at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] at the age of eleven, and became a member of the [[Slug Club]] in the [[1996–1997 school year]].<ref name="SnitchSeekerCarrowTwins">''[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/new-original-characters-cast-half-blood-prince-updated-54082/ New original characters cast for Half-Blood Prince]''</ref>

Hestia and her sister were seemingly quiet at Slug Club meetings, and both had a fondness for the colour green, which they wore not only as part of their House robes, but by their choosing, as reflected by the formal dresses they wore to the [[Slug Club Christmas party]].<ref name="HBPF">{{HBP|F}}</ref>

===1997-1998 school year===
{{Quote|Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in front of him had risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins.|Wands being turned on the Slytherin students before the battle|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince}}[[File:Slytherins battle.jpg|251x251px|thumb|left|Flora and Hestia standing behind Pansy Parkinson]]

Hestia was present in the Great Hall prior to the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] when classmate [[Pansy Parkinson]] urged students to hand over [[Harry Potter]] to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]].<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref> As she and her sister were underage to fight in the battle, they likely departed the school along with most other members of their house before the battle started.

==Etymology==
"Hestia" comes from the Greek ''Ἑστία ''(''estía'', meaning "hearth"). Hestia is the Greek goddess of the hearth, architecture, the right ordering of domesticity, the family, and the state. She is therefore one of the more mighty Greek gods.

*This character is only introduced in {{HBP|FA}} and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1|Part 1]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2|Part 2]]'' of {{DH}}.
*Hestia Carrow is portrayed by actress [[Amber and Ruby Evans|Ruby Evans]].<ref name="SnitchSeekerCarrowTwins" />
*Both she and her sister [[Flora Carrow|Flora]] were likely invited to join the [[Slug Club]] due to their pure-blood heritage (and perhaps a devotion to Slytherin House, possibly indicated by their fondness for green). The Carrow family are one of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]], meaning they are one of the twenty-eight pure-blooded families left in Great Britain.
*It is likely that the Carrow twins are related to [[Alecto and Amycus Carrow]], as all four of them have Greco-Roman forenames and the same surname.
