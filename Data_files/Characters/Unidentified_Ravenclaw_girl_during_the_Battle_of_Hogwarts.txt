She attended a couple of meetings, including when the group learned the [[Stunning Spell]]; she witnessed [[Nigel Wolpert]] practising on [[Harry Potter]], as well as when [[Hermione Granger]] used it on [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. She laughed at Ron when he was thrown across the room, and fussed over Hermione afterward.<ref name="OOTP 3">[https://i0.wp.com/caps.pictures/200/7-harry-potter-order-phoenix/full/order-of-the-phoenix-movie-screencaps.com-7231.jpg see this screenshot]</ref>
