==Biography==
===Early life===
Kellah was born in either [[1979]] or [[1980]],<ref name="age"/> likely in either [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]].

===Hogwarts years===
====Early years====
In [[1991]], Kellah began her magical studies at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]], home to the brave and daring, during the [[Sorting ceremony]]. Along with the other Gryffindors, Kellah was led by [[Percy Weasley]] to the [[Gryffindor Tower|Gryffindor Common Room]] and through the [[Fat Lady]]'s portrait. She shared a dormitory with [[Hermione Granger]], [[Lavender Brown]], [[Parvati Patil]] and other unidentified girls. Her [[Head of House]] was [[Minerva McGonagall]], the [[Professor]] of [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]].<ref name="POAF"/>

====Third year====

In [[1993]], Kellah did clap after [[Rubeus Hagrid]] was announced as [[Silvanus Kettleburn]]'s successor as the [[Care of Magical Creatures]] [[professor]], although very unenthused, unlike her fellow enthusiastic Gryffindors, implying she may not have been massively fond of him.<ref name="POAF"/>

[[Remus Lupin]] was appointed as the [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]] that school year. Kellah attended her first Defence Against the Dark Arts class when she presented a [[Boggart]] to the class.<ref name="POAF"/> One by one, each student had to confront the Boggart, which would take the form of their greatest fear. Kellah's turned into either a [[rat]], [[rattlesnake]] or a bloody eyeball.<ref name="POA7"/>

This year, she chose [[Care of Magical Creatures]] as an elective subject and was present when [[Professor]] [[Rubeus Hagrid]], [[Professor]] [[Silvanus Kettleburn]]'s successor, presented a [[Hippogriff]] named [[Buckbeak]] to the class. Kellah also was around Harry Potter's bed in the hospital wing and presented his broken broomstick to him with [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. Kellah appeared to be close with [[Seamus Finnigan]], opting to sit with him during lessons and meal times as opposed to her friends [[Lavender Brown]] and [[Parvati Patil]].<ref name="POAF"/>

==Physical appearance==
She was a black girl with black/brown hair worn in braids. She wore a single stud earring on each ear.<ref name="POAF"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Kellah appears only in {{POA|FA}}. Portrayed by [[Kandice Morris]], this character is listed in the film's credits as simply "Girl 1," but on the actress' [http://www.yptc.co.uk/agency/kandicemorris.php casting agency profile], her name is given.
*Kellah is mistakenly listed as [[Lavender Brown]] in an article in the August 3, 2007 issue of ''Entertainment Weekly.''
