'''George von Rheticus'''<ref name="HBP NDS">{{HBP|G}} - NDS version</ref> was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] [[Astronomy (class)|astronomer]]. He had portraits of himself hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="OP"/>

==Biography==
===1991-1992 school year===
By [[1991]], he had a [[Portrait]] hung in [[Hogwarts Castle]]'s [[Grand Staircase]].<ref>{{PS|F}} (See [http://s24.postimg.org/anqakp078/Von_Rethicus_HP1film.jpg this image])</ref>

===1995–1996 school year===
By the start of the [[1995–1996 school year]], his portrait hid a secret passage between the [[Grand Staircase]] and the seventh-floor corridor. His [[password]] was "''Scurrilous Scoundrel''." When [[Hannah Abbott]] asked for a shortcut to somewhere near the [[Room of Requirement]] so she was not caught by [[Dolores Umbridge]], [[Harry Potter]] told her about this portrait.<ref name="OP" /> There was another portrait of him hung at the [[Viaduct Entrance]], hiding a shortcut to the [[Grand Staircase]]. The latter's password was "''Iunctis viribus''."<ref name="OP GBA">{{OOTP|G}} - GBA version</ref> He had yet one more portrait next to the [[Hogwarts Castle|Second-floor girls' lavatory]], near the [[Tapestry Corridor]]. Not hiding any shortcut, this portrait knew about the current events at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]] and liked to help students keeping out of trouble, if they proved to him they weren't "scoundrels," that is.<ref name="OP GBA" />

===1996–1997 school year===
The [[1996–1997 school year|following school year]], 1996-1997, von Rheticus's portrait had been moved to the [[Entrance Hall]], this time hiding a way to the Portrait Room.<ref name="HBP NDS" />

==Personality and traits==
As a [[portrait]], he was very helpful and did not mind helping [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] students when they needed it. He once helped [[Harry Potter]] finding a broken suit of armour in order to avoid punishment from [[Severus Snape]].<ref name="OP GBA" /> He also gave his password to [[Harry Potter]] in order to help fellow [[Dumbledore's Army]] member, [[Hannah Abbott]].<ref name="OP" /> However he refuses helping people whom he suspects are, as he put it, scoundrels. In his view, no scoundrel is good at [[Astronomy (class)|Astronomy]], so when he thinks someone is one, he asks him to fill in a star chart in order to know if they are trustworthy.<ref name="OP GBA" />

==Behind the scenes==
*Georg Joachim von Rheticus (1514-1574) was an Austrian mathematician and astronomer and the sole pupil of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], known for his assistance in getting Copernicus' ''On the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres'' published. His original surname was von Lauchen, but because his father was executed and his family exiled, they were stripped of their name. He chose Rheticus, from the Roman province of Rhaetia that included Austria, as his new surname.
*Von Rheticus may have passed away sometime prior to [[1993]], as many portraits hung at Hogwarts Castle depict deceased individuals.
*George von Rheticus's portrait bears a resemblance to a real-world [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/King_James_I_of_England_and_VI_of_Scotland_by_John_De_Critz_the_Elder.jpg portrait of King James I of England], by [[Wikipedia:John de Critz|John de Critz the Elder]].
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{OOTP}} the portrait has a very strong German accent. In the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{HBP}}, his name suggests he is a German wizard ("von" being used as a part of a German family name).
*In {{PS|FA}} there is an [[Unidentified Ravenclaw prefect]] that leads a group of first years to [[Ravenclaw Tower]]. But, he is shown descending into the [[Dungeons]]. It is possible that he is going towards von Rheticus's portrait, to go to the Seventh Floor.

==Etymology==
The name "George" comes from the Greek name Γεωργιος (Georgios) which was derived from the Greek word γεωργος (georgos) meaning "farmer, earthworker", itself derived from the elements γη (ge) "earth" and εργον (ergon) "work". Saint George was a 3rd-century Roman soldier from Palestine who was martyred during the persecutions of emperor Diocletian. Later legends describe his defeat of a dragon, with which he was often depicted in medieval art.
