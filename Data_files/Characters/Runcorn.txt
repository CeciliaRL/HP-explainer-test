'''Runcorn '''(c. [[1979]]-[[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]]<ref name="female"/> who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]]. She was in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] and was sorted into either [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]], or [[Slytherin]] house.<ref name="house"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Only Runcorn's surname is visible on the small portion of the second page of [[J. K. Rowling]]'s student list shown on {{HPM}}.
*Although her name is visible on [[J. K. Rowling]]'s student list, Runcorn is not featured on the "Original Forty" list on {{PM}}. As said list actually only features thirty-nine characters, Runcorn was presumably left out by mistake.
*She could possibly have been a relative of [[Albert Runcorn]], a Ministry worker whom [[Harry Potter]] once impersonated through the means of [[Polyjuice Potion]].
