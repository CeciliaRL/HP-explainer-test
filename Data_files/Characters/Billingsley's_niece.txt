==Biography==
At some point during the [[1990–1991 school year]], Billingsley's niece was at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] as a visitor. When she saw [[Jacob's sibling]] sneaking in [[Fang]] (passing as a wizard who had been [[Transfiguration|Transfigured]] into a dog) to visit [[Rubeus Hagrid]] in one of the wards, she remarked it reminded her of a time her uncle had Transfigured himself into a [[parrot]].<ref name="HM720"/>
