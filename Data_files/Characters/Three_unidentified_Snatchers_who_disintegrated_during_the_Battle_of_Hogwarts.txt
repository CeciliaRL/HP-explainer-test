These '''three individuals''' were [[wizardkind|wizards]] and [[Snatchers]] during the height of the [[Second Wizarding War]].<ref name="DHpt2"/>

==Biography==
Just before midnight, on [[1 May]], [[1998]], these three [[Snatchers]] were led to the [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts Grounds]] by [[Scabior]] in order to take part in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. Apparently unaware of them, these three wizards ran straight into the protective enchantments placed around the Castle, and disintegrated on the spot. This led the [[Snatchers|Snatcher]] army to wait outside the [[Wooden Bridge]] until the [[Death Eaters]] had broken the magical protection.<ref name="DHpt2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{LEGO|Y2}}, the snatchers do not appear. However, the shield that protected [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] simply repels the enemies rather than disintegrating them.
