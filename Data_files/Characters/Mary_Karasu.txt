'''Mary Karasu''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who was known for her exceptional culinary skills.<ref name="TGHC"/>

==Biography==
During the [[1988–1989 school year]], Mary and [[Rosa Karasu]] visited [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] to hold a cook-off for students. They announced the event in the [[Great Hall]] where the students and faculty were gathered. As they were grandmothers of [[Tulip Karasu|Tulip]], a friend of [[Jacob's sibling]], they were personally introduced to the latter by her, and greeted them affectionately.<ref name="TGHC"/>

They were the judges of the [[Great Hogwarts Cook-Off]]. When the contestants finished their dishes, Mary and Rosa offered some constructive criticism to every one of them, but inadvertently angered [[Ismelda Murk]] by calling her dough "sad and soggy", who transformed her [[meat pie]] into a [[Dough Creature|monster]], which destroyed [[Diego Caplan]]'s [[flan]] and overall made a mess.<ref name="TGHC"/>

The event had become a disaster, but Mary and Rosa were later approached by Jacob's sibling and Tulip with the idea that it could be turned into a collaboration between the contestants, who would share their ingredients to perfect all the dishes. They heartily agreed to it. Later, they attended the feast and commended on the final outcome. They had also decided to award Jacob's sibling for their significant part in organising and changing the course of the event.<ref name="TGHC"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*The game isn't clear as to what the exact relationship is among Mary, Rosa and Tulip. Some speculate that Mary and Rosa are a couple based on their shared surname and both of them being Tulip's grandmother. They might also simply be sisters-in-law with the same surname. A [https://twitter.com/HogwartsMystery/status/1408772123661852674 twitter feed] from the {{HM}} official account states that Mary and Rosa are Tulip's "aunts", but this is likely a mistake, as the dialogues in the game make it very clear that Tulip is their granddaughter.
