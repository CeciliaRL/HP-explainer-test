'''Amber Noel''' was a [[Gryffindor]] [[Wizardkind|student]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. She once signed up for [[Quidditch]] training at 7pm on Tuesday on a sign-up sheet that was posted on the [[Gryffindor Notice Board|bulletin board]] in the [[Gryffindor Common Room]].<ref>{{See image|File:QuidditchTrainingSignupSheet.jpg}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Amber" comes from the English word amber that denotes either the gemstone, which is formed from fossil resin, or the orange-yellow colour. The word ultimately derives from Arabic عنبر ('anbar). It began to be used as a given name in the late 19th century, but it only became popular after the release of Kathleen Winsor's novel 'Forever Amber' (1944).
