{{Quote|Rowle was succeeded by Perseus Parkinson, who was likewise pro-Azkaban.|Perseus' views as Minister for Magic|Pottermore}}'''Minister Perseus Parkinson''' was [[Minister for Magic|British Minister for Magic]] from [[1726]] to [[1733]].<ref name="WW"/>

==Biography==
He attempted to pass a bill making it illegal to [[Marriage|marry]] a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]. However, in doing so, he misread the public mood; the wizarding public was tired of [[Wizarding Supremacy|anti-Muggle sentiment]] and wanted peace. Parkinson was therefore voted out during the next election for Minister.<ref name="WW">{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>

Perseus Parkinson's attempts to ban mixed marriages were identical to [[Rappaport's Law]] introduced by [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] president [[Emily Rappaport]]. However, unlike in the [[United States of America]], anti-Muggle sentiments were not as widespread and confined to wizarding supremacists.
