This '''[[owl]]''' belonged to [[Professor]] [[Horace Slughorn]]. He used it to send his messages to the [[Slug Club]] in both tenures as [[Potions Master]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. [[Barnabas Cuffe]] would always be happy to take the owl to hear Horace's point of view on the day's news in the [[Daily Prophet]].<ref name="HBPF11">{{HBP|F}} - Chapter 11 (''Cursed Necklace'')</ref>
