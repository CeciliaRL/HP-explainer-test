This '''[[Wizardkind|wizard]]''' was among the crowds celebrating the fall of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in [[1981]] by wearing wizarding attire among [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]. In particular, he was wearing an emerald-green [[cloak]]. [[Vernon Dursley]] saw this wizard on his drive to work on [[1 November]], and considered how ridiculous it was for a man even older than him to be dressed like that.<ref name="PS1">{{PS|B|1}}</ref>
