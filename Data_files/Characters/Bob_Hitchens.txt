'''Bob Hitchens''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]<ref>{{HPFW}}</ref><ref>The hand-drawn tree by J.K. Rowling expressly states that Bob Hitchens is a Muggle, and as her word is the highest form of canon, we know he is a Muggle.</ref> who married the [[Wizardkind|pure-blood witch]] [[Iola Black]], the youngest sister of famous [[Phineas Nigellus Black]]. Their [[marriage]] caused her to be struck off the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]].<ref>''[[House of Black]]''</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It was not clear at first whether Hitchens was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] or a [[Muggle-born]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. Although the partial family tree on the Harry Potter Lexicon lists him as a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]], it does the same for [[Muggle-born]] wizard [[Edward Tonks|Ted Tonks]], possibly indicating that the [[House of Black|Blacks]] did not draw a distinction between Muggles and Muggle-borns. However, in the partial tree written by [[J. K. Rowling]] given in the {{HPFW}}, Ted Tonks is listed as a Muggle-born and Hitchens as a Muggle.
