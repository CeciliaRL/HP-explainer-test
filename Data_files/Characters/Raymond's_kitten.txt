The [[Ravenclaw]] student [[Raymond]] owned a '''kitten''' when he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="PSG"/>

==History==
She fell down one of the [[Hogwarts Castle|Castle]]'s wells in [[1991]]. Raymond was distraught because of this, and tried to reach her, but the well was too deep. [[Harry Potter]] found her when he was lost in the [[Dungeons]], inside an [[Potions Classroom adjoining room|adjoining room]], which linked to the [[Bottom of the Well]], as well as other rooms. Raymond was very pleased to have her back. Raymond later allowed [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nearly Headless Nick]] to use her for an experiment in the ''Upper Castle'' in which students had to chase her around on unstable rocky platforms while she dropped purple [[Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}} - PS1 version</ref>
