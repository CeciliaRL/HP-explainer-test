{{Dialogue a-b-c|Waiter|Dragon tartare?|Hermione Granger|No, I'm fine. Thank you.|Waiter|Just as well. They give one horribly bad breath.|Waiter and Hermione Granger|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)}}
This '''waiter''' served food and drinks at the [[Slug Club]] [[Christmas]] [[Slug Club Christmas party|party]] in [[1996]] along with [[Neville Longbottom]] and [[Waiter serving Dragon Tartare|another waiter]]. He was seen passing by when [[Horace Slughorn]] and [[Harry Potter]] were having their picture taken. He offered [[dragon tartare]] to [[Harry Potter]] and [[Hermione Granger]]. Both passed, and the waiter told them this choice was for the better, as the ''hors d'oeuvre'' gave one ''"terribly bad breath."'' However, upon hearing this, Hermione took the entire plate, hoping to repel the unwelcome attentions of her date, [[Cormac McLaggen]]. He was later seen decorating a plate of food.<ref name="HBPF">{{HBP|F}}</ref>
