{{Quote|Oh, Angus McMangus, you should have been great!<br/>With talents aplenty — success on a plate!<br/>We all thought you'd garner great grades quite securely —<br/>But Angus McMangus, your spells turned out poorly.|Miranda Goshawk, "The Ballad of Angus McMangus"|Wonderbook: Book of Spells}}'''Angus McMangus''' was the character that [[Miranda Goshawk]]'s poem "[[The Ballad of Angry Angus McMangus]]" centres around. Like all characters in these conundrums, Angus was based off a real person, with only his name changed for his protection, in this case a classmate's of Miranda's. Great things were expected from him, but he lacked the patience to achieve them.<ref name="WBS">{{WBS}}</ref>

==Biography==
The student Angus McMangus was based on was born somewhere in [[Great Britain]] in or around [[1921]]. He attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] sometime around [[1932]], being in the same year as Miranda Goshawk. Everyone around him, including himself, expected him to excel in his studies; Miranda described him as having "success on a plate".<ref name="WBS"/>

However, in his first [[Charms (class)|Charms class]], he got frustrated when his first attempt at casting a [[spell]] failed and began to shout and complain. This behaviour continued for each of his classes, giving up after a single mistake. Though his teachers tried to get him to calm down, they were unsuccessful, and his anger finally led him to snap his own [[wand]] in two.<ref name="WBS"/>

Miranda would later remember her former classmate when composing conundrums for the ''[[Book of Spells]]''. Changing his name to Angus McMangus, she wrote the poem "The Ballad of Angry Angus McMangus" about his exploits, including it at the end of chapter three.<ref name="WBS"/>
