'''Susan Blancheflower''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the [[Keeper]] for the [[American National Quidditch team]] in the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]]<ref name="PMI">[http://insider.pottermore.com/2014/07/place-your-bets-with-ludo-bagman-and.html "Place your Bets with Ludo Bagman"] on the ''Pottermore Insider''</ref>.

==Biography==
Following the America-[[Jamaica]] match in the quarter-finals, [[Ludovic Bagman]] criticised Blancheflower for letting in so many Jamaican goals in a report made to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''<ref name="PMI"/>. Partly because of this, he gave her team low odds on winning the semifinals<ref name="PMI"/>.

During the America-[[Brazil]] semifinal match, she was hit in the face with a [[bludger]] sent there by one of her own [[Beater]]s, [[Lucas Picquery]]. She then attempted to jump onto his broom, and was cautioned by the referee. Her game did not improve, however, and she made a simple mistake and let [[Alejandra Alonso]] score, putting Brazil ten points ahead.Â 

During the playoffs for third place against [[Japan]], the Japanese [[Chaser]]s got eighteen goals past her. At the end of the game, though, the two teams embraced.
