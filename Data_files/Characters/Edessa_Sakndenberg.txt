==Biography==
===Lifetime===
Professor Sakndenberg lived in the [[15th century|fifteenth century]]. In her lifetime, she was a social historian, specialising in [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] society.<ref name="HPLEG">{{HPLE|G}} {{see image|File:HomeLifeAndSocialHabitsOfBritishMuggles.png}}</ref> She was appointed [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and had a [[portrait]] painted in [[1503]].<ref>{{HPLE}} {{see image| File:EdessaSakndenbergPortrait.jpg}}</ref>

===Post-mortem===
After her death, her [[Headmaster portraits|portrait]] was hung in the [[Headmaster's office]], so that she could advise the current Headmaster.<ref name="cosdvd" /> She had more portraits around the castle: in the [[East Wing]],<ref name="PoAVG">{{POA|G}}</ref> [[Grand Staircase]]<ref>{{OOTP|G}}</ref> and other halls such as the [[Glanmore Peakes' Corridor]]<ref name="PoAVG"/>

==Etymology==
*"Edessa" (probably originally from a Phrygian or Illyrian word meaning "tower in the water") is the name of a [[wikipedia:Edessa,_Greece|Greek city]] and, in Ancient Greece, also a province.
*Her surname may be the {{wplink|Albania}}n name {{wplink|Skanderbeg}} influenced by German names ending in ''-en-berg''.

==Behind the scenes==
*Edessa Sakndenberg's portrait was based on a [http://www.nationalgalleries.org/media/5/artworks_other/the_hen_wife.jpg 1706 portrait of the Henwife of Castle Grant] by [[Wikipedia:Richard Waitt|Richard Waitt]].
*The phrase on Sakndenberg's portrait (''mirabile visu'') is a Latin expression, meaning "wonderful to behold."<ref name="HPLE-PA"/><ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mirabile%20visu "Mirabile visu"] at Meriam-Webster.com</ref>
*On a wood panel in the Divination Classroom of Hogwarts, a name is partially visible, with '...essa Skanderberg' readable, possibly yet another alternative spelling of her name.<ref name="panel">{{POA}} {{see image|File:EoessaSkanderbergName.jpg}}</ref>
*On the cover of the ''[[Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles]]'' prop that was featured on {{COS|FA}}, Edessa Skanderberg is credited to have authored the book. This is canonically wrong, as we know the book was written by [[Wilhelm Wigworthy]] in [[1987]], but nevertheless we can conclude from the text of the back cover blurb that Edessa was a "''social historian and Muggle specialist''".<ref name="HPLEG" />
*Her portrait in {{HM}} is titled "Edessa Skandenberg", but as third-tier [[canon]] is outranked by the spelling on the second-tier film portrait.<ref>{{HM|4|16}} ([https://youtu.be/4k8KS864KCs?t=1745 see video])</ref>
