==Etymology==
The name "Bruno" is derived from the Germanic element brun meaning "brown". Saint Bruno of Cologne was a German monk of the 11th century who founded the Carthusian Order. Schmidt is a common German occupational surname derived from the German word "Schmied" meaning "blacksmith" and/or "metalworker". This surname is the German equivalent of "Smith" in the English-speaking world.
