This '''[[goblin]]''' was given the unenviable task of informing [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] that a [[Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998)|break-in]] had occurred at [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], his current place of occupation, and that an item had been stolen from the [[Lestrange family|Lestrange]] [[Lestrange Vault|Vault]], in May 1998.<ref name="DH27"/>

[[File:Slaughter at Malfoy Manor.png|250px|thumb|The goblin is killed, along with all others that came to bring Voldemort the bad news]]
When Voldemort demanded to know what had been taken, the goblin hesitantly replied that the stolen object was a [[Helga Hufflepuff's Cup|small golden cup]]. Enraged at the loss of one of his [[Horcrux]]es, Voldemort immediately [[Massacre at Malfoy Manor|killed]] the goblin with the [[Killing Curse]], as well as several [[Wizardkind|wizards]] present at the time.<ref name="DH27"/>

Voldemort kicked the goblin's corpse aside as he paced the room and planned his next move.<ref name="DH27">{{DH|B|27}}</ref>
