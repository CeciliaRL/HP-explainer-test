{{Quote|That horrible incident in Charms class has followed me around ever since we were first-years. Most people don't even know my real name… they just call me 'Wingardium Leviosa Kid'.|Levi Kidd|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
'''Wilfred Levi Kidd''',  also known as '''Leviosa Kid''' or just simply '''Levi''', was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1980s]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]]. He had [[Charms (class)|Charms]],<ref name="Charms" /> [[Flying (class)|Flying]],<ref name="Flying">{{HM}}, [[Flying (class)|Flying]] Class</ref> and [[History of Magic]]<ref name="HoM" /> classes with [[Jacob's sibling]].

==Biography==
===First year===
{{Quote|That's funny, he's a Gryffindor in our year but I never learned his name…|[[Ben Copper]] about Levi|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
Levi started attending Hogwarts on [[1 September]] [[1984]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]].<ref name="Charms" /><ref name="HoM" />

Levi frequently struggled with the [[Levitation Charm]] in [[Charms (class)|Charms classes]], taught by [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]].<ref name="Charms" />

In his first year, he bit someone. Jacob's sibling suspected that he was the [[werewolf]] whom [[Cecil Lee]] was looking for. [[Rowan Khanna]] doubted it.<ref name="31oct">{{HM|1|Hallowe'en Feast}}</ref>

===Second year===
{{Quote|If I hang around you, something interesting is bound to happen.|Levi to Jacob's sibling|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
During his [[second year]], Levi worried about [[Ben Copper]] being missing. He also noticed [[Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore's]] absence, and suggested that it was due to either Ben or [[Tom Riddle|He Who Must Not Be Named]].<ref name="HM">{{HM|2|1|c}}</ref>

===Fifth year===
By their [[fifth year]], Jacob's sibling and their friends did not remember Levi's name; Jacob's sibling had completely forgotten he was in their year by that point. [[Ben Copper]] considered it too rude to ask him his name.<ref name="HoM" />

Shortly before [[Hallowe'en]] [[1988]],<ref>In the {{HM}} Hallowe'en event, [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] states that that year's Hallowe'en will be his four hundred ninety-sixth deathday regardless of the player's progress. [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party]] was in [[1992]] and four years before that was 1988.</ref> the boy volunteered to help [[Albus Dumbledore]] decorate the [[Great Hall]] for the [[Hallowe'en Feast]]. He carved [[pumpkin]]s along with Jacob's sibling, [[Rowan Khanna]], [[Penny Haywood]] and [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]]. Jacob's sibling and Rowan did not remember his name, and the latter wondered whether he'd be offended if they asked him for his name. They hoped he didn't try to levitate the pumpkin he was working on, and noticed that he appeared to be carving a feather in to it. He also helped the two make decorations.<ref>{{HM|5|Help Dumbledore with Hallowe'en}}</ref>

[[File:LeviosaKid O.W.L.png|200px|thumb|left|Levi receives his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] results]]
At the end of the school year, he took the [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]]s and got at least three [[Acceptable]] grades.<ref>See [[:File:LeviosaKid O.W.L.png|this image]].</ref> Despite struggling with the subject, he managed to get a high enough grade in Charms to continue taking the subject at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]] level.<ref name="Charms"/> He also continued taking History of Magic<ref name="HoM" /> and [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]].<ref name="RCB"/>

He also was one of the spectators of the play ''[[Equinox Enchanted]]''.<ref name="AEK">{{HM|5|AN ENCHANTED KISS}}</ref>

{{Quote|Leviosa Kid seems a little too nervous.|[[Tulip Karasu]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
He tried to participate in the [[Great Hogwarts Cook-Off]] by making a levitating [[soufflé]], but had to ask [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]]'s help regarding the [[Levitation Charm]].<ref name="TGHC">{{HM|5|THE GREAT HOGWARTS COOK-OFF}}</ref>

===Sixth year===
{{Expand}}
{{Quote|As a [[Unidentified Sphinx|wise Sphinx]] once said, the 'Gift of Hogwarts' is that it brings people together… And I'm very glad this mission has brought me together with you!|[[Jacob's sibling]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
During the [[1989–1990 school year]], Levi asked [[Jacob's sibling]] to tutor him in becoming a [[Curse-Breaker]]. They went on a mission together with [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]]. When it was over, he also successfully mastered the [[Levitation Charm]].<ref name="RCB">{{HM|6|THE RISE OF A CURSE-BREAKER}}</ref>

{{Quote|I always used to copy off of Rowan. Now what should I do?|Levi to Jacob's sibling|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
After [[Rowan Khanna]]'s death, [[Wilfred Kidd Senior|his dad]] wanted to pull him out, because he thought Hogwarts wasn't safe.<ref name="Charms" />

===Seventh year===
According to Levi in his seventh year, he was better at History of Magic than Charms. However, he didn't even know who [[Emeric the Evil]] was until [[Corey Hayden]] explained.<ref name="HM73">{{HM|7|3}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Although he spent many years failing to master this simple charm, he eventually mastered the [[Levitation Charm]] in his [[sixth year]].<ref name="RCB"/> He also passed the [[Charms (class)|subject]] with a high enough grade at [[Ordinary Wizarding Level]].<ref name="Charms"/>
*'''[[History of Magic]]''': He enjoyed studying History of Magic at Hogwarts, and managed to gain a high enough grade in the subject at Ordinary Wizarding Level.<ref name="HoM"/>
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': He was able to study [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] at [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.]]-level, meaning he gained a high enough grade in the subject at Ordinary Wizarding Level. He demonstrated the ability to [[Transformation|transform]] a [[Gobstone to Skunk|feather duster into a skunk]] one lesson.<ref name="RCB"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Levi stays unidentified in the first five years of {{HM}}, until [[The Rise of a Curse-Breaker]] adventure, which is set in the sixth year and focuses on him.
*When Jacob's sibling casts a powerful Levitation Charm to levitate themselves, they mention they have been "practising it over and over with a struggling Gryffindor kid in Charms class".<ref>{{HM|4|13}}</ref> Although unconfirmed, they were likely referring to Levi.
*Levi was the only student in Jacob's sibling's [[History of Magic]] class whose name was unknown until Jacob's sibling became friends with him, and he was also the only one in the class who is not in their [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] class.
*Levi's name is a play on "Leviosa Kid", which he came to be known as by fans of the game due to [[Jacob's sibling]] constantly being asked by [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] to assist him with the [[Levitation Charm]] during [[Charms (class)|Charms class]].
