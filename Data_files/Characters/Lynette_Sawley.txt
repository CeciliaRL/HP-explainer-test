'''Lynette Sawley''' was a [[wizardkind|witch]] and a [[Hufflepuff]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
She planned on giving her mother a [[Self-Stirring Cauldron]] for [[Christmas]] in [[1996]]. However, [[Harry Potter]] also wanted to give a Self-Stirring Cauldron to [[Molly Weasley]], but did not have one, so Lynette agreed to give him the one she had in exchange for a vial of [[Elixir to Induce Euphoria]]. When Harry gave her the [[potion]], she said she would tell her mother that he had made it, and that this would make her mother ''"so excited."''<ref name="HBPG"/>
