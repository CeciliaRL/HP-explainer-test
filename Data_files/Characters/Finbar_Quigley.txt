'''Finbar Quigley''' was a [[Quidditch]] player for the [[Ballycastle Bats]]<ref>[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[8 February]], [[1999]], Page 3</ref>. Finbar did not dare disagree with [[Gwenog Jones]] when she commented on the ever-increasing number of fans of the [[Holyhead Harpies]] for the [[Daily Prophet]], for he feared being [[Transfiguration|turned]] into a [[Wood louse|Wood lice]].<ref>[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[31 July]], [[1998]], Page 2</ref><ref>https://www.hp-lexicon.org/character/finbar-quigley/</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that Finbar Quigley is the [[Quigley|Beater]] for the [[Irish National Quidditch team]] as they share the same last name and Ballycastle could refer to either the small town in [[Northern Ireland]] or the village in the Republic of [[Ireland]]. If so, it is likely that he plays Beater for the Ballycastle Bats.
