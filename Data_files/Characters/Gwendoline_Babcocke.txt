}}'''Gwendoline Babcocke''' was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[wizardkind|witch]] that worked as a shop assistant at [[The Magic Neep]] in [[Hogsmeade]].<ref name="FBC7"/>

==Biography==
She received several notes and gifts such as chocolates and lavender perfume from an anonymous admirer, including an night-time invitation to the [[Boathouse]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] which caught [[fire]] just as she arrived.<ref name="FBC7">{{FBC|7}}</ref>

Enamoured with [[dragon]]s, she owned a copy of ''[[Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit]]'' but would never leave Hogsmeade to work with them as it would break [[Gwendoline Babcocke's mother|her mum]]'s heart. In addition to her interest in [[magic]]al [[beast]]s, she said she was a natural at the [[Stinging Jinx]].<ref name="FBC7"/>
