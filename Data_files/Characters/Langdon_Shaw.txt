'''Langdon Shaw''' was an [[United States of America|American]] [[No-Maj]] who lived in the early [[20th century]]. He was the younger son of newspaper magnate [[Henry Shaw Senior]].<ref name="featurette">{{PM}} - "[https://www.pottermore.com/news/8-exciting-clues-from-the-fantastic-beasts-featurette 8 exciting clues from the Fantastic Beasts featurette]"</ref><ref name="description">"[http://www.fantasticbeastsmovies.com/ Full Character Descriptions]" from FantasticBeastsMovies.com</ref> He had at least one sibling, an older brother [[Henry Shaw Junior]] who was elected to the United States Senate in [[1920]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
While his older brother, the senator [[Henry Shaw Junior]], was Shaw Snr's pride and joy, Langdon was viewed as something of a failure and disappointment. This did not stop him from constantly trying to seek his father's approval.<ref name="description" />

===The Obscurus===

====Meeting the Barebones====

On [[6 December]] [[1926]], Langdon brought [[Mary Lou Barebone]] from the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]] and her adopted children [[Credence Barebone|Credence]], [[Chastity Barebone|Chastity]] and [[Modesty Barebone|Modesty]] to [[Shaw News]] meet with his father. Barging into Shaw Snr's office, Langdon laid out a portfolio filled with a series of photographic evidence of [[magic|witchcraft]] and told his father of his belief that "strange things [were] going on all over" [[New York]] and that the people behind these incidents were "[[wizardkind|not like [them]]]," certain that he was giving him the scoop of the century.<ref name="description" /> His father and brother both dismissed his claims.<ref name="description" />

Henry Shaw Senior refused to give Mary Lou the support of his newspaper company and his elder son's re-election platform, and asked the [[Barebone family]] to leave. While they were departing, Mary Lou's adopted son Credence dropped a leaflet, which Henry Shaw Jr handed back to him, while unashamedly and cruelly calling him a freak.<ref name="FBS">{{FB|S}}</ref>

====Attack on the Fundraising Dinner Hall====

Langdon later attended his brother's [[Henry Shaw Junior's fundraising dinner|fundraising dinner]] with his father. While his brother was in the middle of his speech, an [[Obscurus|invisible force]] burst forth from beneath the organ. It soared across the hall, sending tables flying, and throwing people around as it carved a line toward the stage where Shaw Jr was still standing. Langdon watched as the invisible force threw his brother backwards against his poster, and then raised him up high where he was suspended for just a moment in midair before being thrown violently back down onto the stage, dead. In the midst of sounds of anguish and panic from the crowd, his father crouched beside his slain son. Langdon, who was slightly drunk, determinedly and triumphantly stated that this was the work of witchcraft.<ref name="FBS"/>

====Obscurial attack on New York====

On the next night, [[7 December]] [[1926]], Langdon was present when [[Credence Barebone]] unleashed his [[Obscurus]] on New York, and [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] began magically sealing off the subway entrance where Credence had taken refuge. Having seen magic first-hand, Langdon revelled in the spectacle as Shaw Snr vowed to expose the wizarding kind.<ref name="FB111">{{FB|S|111}}</ref> When the dawn of [[8 December]] came, [[Newton Scamander]] unleashed [[Frank]] the [[Thunderbird]], who created a rainstorm laced with [[Swooping Evil venom]], [[Memory Charm|Obliviating]] all [[Non-magic people|No-Majs']] memories of magic, including Langdon's, who stood in the [[Water|rain]] as his expression grew blank.<ref name="FB118">{{FB|S|118}}</ref> 

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Shaw Snr and the senator look dubious—all too used to Langdon’s harebrained little projects and interests.|Shaw Senior and the Senator reaction about Langdon|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
Langdon Shaw was an excitable young man with a proclivity for wild ideas. He was frustrated by living in his elder brother’s shadow, and constantly tried to seek his father's approval and attention. He was also excited to try to show he had authority or power. Langdon appeared to have a tendency to drink too much [[alcohol]].

==Relationships==
===Family===
[[File:Shaw Family FB1.png|thumb|Langdon with his father and brother]]
Langdon's relationship with his father and brother seemed to be quite poor. His father [[Henry Shaw Senior]] saw him as a disappointment and was rather contemptuous of him, constantly dismissing Langdon and even refusing to listen to anything he said, including his belief in witchcraft, all the while favouring and praising his brother [[Henry Shaw Junior|Henry Shaw Jr]].
