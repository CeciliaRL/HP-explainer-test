'''Professor Marlowe Forfang''' (fl. late [[19th century|1800s]]) was an [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and a great authority on [[Werewolf|werewolves]]. He studied werewolves for a long time, being the first to undertake a comprehensive study of their habits. From his study, he concluded that most werewolves are [[wizardkind]]; [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s "taste" different than wizards to a werewolf, and are much more likely to die from their injuries rather than be turned.<ref name="PM"/>
