{{Quote|I am deeply hurt at your false and vicious assertion that I am nothing but a flesh-eating monster.|Annis Black in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''|The Daily Prophet (real-world)}}
'''Annis Black''' (fl. [[1999]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Hag]] who lived in [[Annis Black's cave|a cave]] in [[Deadmarsh]], [[England]] during the late twentieth century. She wrote a letter to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' complaining about the paper's portrayal of Hags as [[flesh]]-eating monsters. Her letter stated that her own interests included poetry, crochet and gardening. She also offered baby-sitting services.<ref name="DP">{{DP|N|1}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The name Annis Black is presumably based on the legendary Hag [[Wikipedia:Black Annis|Black Annis]], who is said to have eaten [[human]] children, and then hung their skins on the walls of her cave. Therefore, it seems somewhat suspicious that she would want to offer baby-sitting services to look after [[human]] children, possibly implying that like the rest of her species, she has a taste for their flesh.
*Annis Black was not related to the [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizarding]] [[House of Black]].
