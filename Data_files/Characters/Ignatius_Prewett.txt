'''Ignatius Prewett''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who married [[Lucretia Black]].<ref>''[[House of Black|Black Family tree]]''</ref> He was an uncle by blood of [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]] and [[Gideon Prewett]], as well as their sister [[Molly Weasley|Molly]],<ref>[[Sirius Black]] stated in Ch. 6 of {{OOTP}} that Molly Weasley was his "cousin by marriage". This means that Ignatius could not have been Molly, Fabian, and Gideon's father, as this would have made them first cousins by blood of Sirius [false logic: this merely means that Lucretia Black Prewett (Ignatius' wife) could not have been their mother]. Ignatius was Sirius's uncle by marriage, and if Molly was his niece, this could explain Sirius's comment. See this article's [[Talk:Ignatius Prewett|talk page]] for more information.</ref> and an uncle by [[marriage]] of [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and [[Regulus Black]]. Ignatius and his wife Lucretia did not have any children of their own. 

Given that Molly gave her third son [[Percy Weasley|Percy]] the middle name "Ignatius", presumably in honour of her uncle, it is likely that she and Ignatius were close.

==Behind the scenes==
*''Ignatius'' is a Roman name altered from its original Etruscan to resemble the Latin ''ignis'', "[[fire]]". It was the name of several saints, including the founder of the Jesuits.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/ignatius Behind the Name: Ignatius]</ref>
*Given that [[Lucretia Black]] from the [[House of Black|Black Family]] was not disowned and burnt off the Black Family Tree, implies that her marriage to Ignatius Prewett was a "respectable" pure-blood marriage.
