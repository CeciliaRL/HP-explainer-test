'''Marius Black''' was the third child of [[Cygnus Black II]] and [[Violetta Bulstrode]], and brother of [[Pollux Black]], [[Cassiopeia Black]], and [[Dorea Black]]. Marius was disowned and removed from the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]] for being born a Squib, a wizard-born person with no magical abilities. The Blacks were likely ashamed of his status, as Squibs are considered second-class citizens in the wizarding world and disregarded.

Marius's date of birth is unknown, but given when his siblings were born, Marius was likely born between [[1915]] and [[1920]].

==Etymology==
[[Wikipedia:Marius|Marius]] is a Roman name derived from [[Wikipedia:Mars (mythology)|Mars, the Roman god]] of war. It was the name of several Roman generals, a philosopher, and an emperor. [[Wikipedia:Gaius Marius|One of those Roman generals]] was renowned for his revolutionary military reforms and for being elected consul an unprecedented [[seven]] times. The name is also sometimes used as a masculine version of the name ''Maria'',<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/marius Behind the Name: Marius]</ref> which is derived from the Hebrew name ''Miriam'', the meaning of which is usually theorised to be "sea of bitterness",<ref>[[Wikipedia:Mary (given name)|Given name Mary]] at [[Wikipedia:Main Page|Wikipedia]]</ref> or, alternatively, derived from the ancient egyptic ''mry; ''beloved, or ''mr''; love. Marius is also the name of [[Wikipedia:Marius Pontmercy|one of the main characters]] in Victor Hugo's ''[[Wikipedia:Les Misérables|Les Misérables]].''

Marius is also the name of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marius_(crater) moon crater] , which fits in with the Black family tradition of naming children after stars.

==Behind the scenes==
*He may have had descendants (which may have been [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] or Squibs) but because he was disowned by his [[House of Black|family]], they did not appear on the family tree.
