He was eventually caught and killed by a specially-assigned group of [[Wizardkind|wizards]] from the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]. He appears on a [[Chocolate Frog Card|Famous Wizard Card]].<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}} ([https://youtu.be/fUmFT12Bg2o?t=410 see video])</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This character probably references ''[[Wikipedia:Varney the Vampire|Varney the Vampire or the Feast of Blood]]'', a Gothic horror story written by James Malcolm Rymer in the [[19th century]], and one of the first vampire novels ever written (predating and influencing Bram Stoker's more popular Dracula).<ref name="WVV">{{Wikilink|Varney the Vampire}}</ref>
*Herbert Varney may have also been loosely based on the unidentified serial killer [[Wikipedia:Jack the Ripper|Jack the Ripper]], who in [[1888]] brutally murdered at least five women in London, but was never caught or identified.<ref name="WJR">{{Wikilink|Jack the Ripper}}</ref>
