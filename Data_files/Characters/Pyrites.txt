'''Pyrites''' (fl. [[1981]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and a servant of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] at around the time of the [[First Wizarding War]]. He was a dandy wizard who often wore white silk gloves, which would sometimes be stained with [[blood]].<ref name="jkr">"Opening Chapters of Philosopher's Stone" on {{JKRS}} - archived [http://web.archive.org/web/20110623035050/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=1 here]</ref>

==Etymology==
Pyrites is named after [[Wikipedia:Pyrite|the mineral]], which is more commonly known as fool's gold.<ref name="jkr" />

==Behind the scenes==
*Pyrites only appears in early drafts of the first chapter of {{PS}}. In these drafts, he would have met up with [[Sirius Black]] in front of the [[Potters' Cottage|Potter cottage]]. The character was cut entirely, however, with the switch in perspective to [[Vernon Dursley]]'s day rather than the scene at [[Godric's Hollow]].<ref name="jkr" />
*He may have been related to [[Argo Pyrites]], the author of ''[[Alchemy, Ancient Art and Science]]'', or the two might have been one and the same.
