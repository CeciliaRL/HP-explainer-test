This '''[[Dark Wizard]]''' was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and a servant of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]].<ref name="DHF1"/><ref name="DHF2"/>

==Biography==
He was one of the many Death Eaters who were present at the [[Meeting at Malfoy Manor|meeting]] in [[Malfoy Manor]]. He was sitting next to [[Corban Yaxley]] and appeared to be the youngest of the Death Eaters present with the exception of [[Draco Malfoy]]. When [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] asked one of his followers to hand over their [[wand]], he remained silent with his head down, in fear of his master's deeply malign and terrifying presence.<ref name="DHF1">{{DH|F1}}</ref>

He later fought during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] on [[2 May]], [[1998]]. He survived the first round, and after [[Harry Potter]] [[Horcrux|sacrificed himself]] to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] in the [[Forbidden Forest]], he guarded the captured [[Rubeus Hagrid]] back to the castle along with other Death Eaters, while Hagrid carried Harry's believed dead body.<ref name="DHF2"/>

After Harry revealed that he was actually alive, is possible that he fled the battle, along with other [[Death Eaters]]. It is also highly possible that he was killed during the final stages of the battle, or arrested and sent to [[Azkaban]] for his crimes as a Death Eater.<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The Death Eater was portrayed by [[Bob Yves Van Hellenberg Hubar]] in {{DH|FA1}} and {{DH|FA2}}.
