Because the commission found Alderton guilty of this, it is likely that he was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]. Despite this, his son claimed on leaving his trial that his father was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. He also claimed that he once worked for the [[British Ministry of Magic]] for thirty years. Apparently, William Alderton always wore his jacket inside-out while working for the Ministry of Magic.<ref>{{DH|F1}}</ref>
