'''Bilton Bilmes''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who, during the [[1980s]], was living in the [[Highlands]] of [[Scotland]], having taken up both residence and employment in the picturesque little all-wizarding village of [[Hogsmeade]] as the proprietor of [[Zonko's Joke Shop]].<ref name="HM34">{{HM|3|4}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life===
Bilton Bilmes was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]] into a wizarding family of unknown [[blood status]], and attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. During his school career, if his later profession is any indication, he was well known for his sense of humour. Sometime either during his schooling or after he graduated from Hogwarts, he poured [[Bulbadox powder]] in [[Horace Slughorn]]'s [[mead]] as a prank.<ref name="HM45">{{HM|4|5}}</ref> It is also unknown what [[Hogwarts Houses|House]] he was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into whilst at Hogwarts.

===Later life===
He once accidentally set off some [[Stink Pellets]] in the closet in his home and, unable to get the smell out, resolved to burn every piece of clothing he owned and buy new ones, only to accidentally [[Fire|burn]] his home to the ground in the process. This mistake would haunt him for many years to come. By the [[1980s]], Bilton had settled down in [[Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade Village]] and took up a job at the local joke shop. Loud and affable, and with a childlike fondness and enthusiasm for pranks and mischief, Bilton was always happy to accommodate the young scoundrels of [[Hogwarts Castle]] with the latest within classical trouble-making whenever they came to his shop looking for prank devices, and actively encouraged their practical jokes.{{Fact}}

During the [[1990–1991 school year]], Bilmes got a [[Nose-Biting Teacup]] stuck to his nose, for which he had to go to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] to get it removed. As part of their assignments as [[seventh year]]s, [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Jae Kim]] attended to him in his hospital bed.<ref name="HM719">{{HM|7|19}}</ref>
