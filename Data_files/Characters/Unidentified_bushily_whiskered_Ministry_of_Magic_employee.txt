This '''man''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]], who was an employee at the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]] in the late-[[1990s]]. On [[2 September]], [[1997]], after [[Albert Runcorn]] tracked down the wizard who faked [[Dirk Cresswell]]'s family tree and Cresswell was sent to [[Azkaban]], this wizard congratulated who he believed to be Runcorn (but was actually [[Harry Potter]] in [[Polyjuice Potion|disguise]]) as he was confident he would take Cresswell's job at the [[Goblin Liaison Office]] with him out of the picture.<ref name="DH12">{{DH|B|12}}</ref>
