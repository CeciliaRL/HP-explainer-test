{{Quote|What makes us yearn for the comfort of others? Why does a broken heart hurt so? Love imbues itself into our very bones, our very souls. I believe that love is the greatest and most dangerous magic in the world.|Amorette Deneuve to [[Grim Fawley]]|Harry Potter: Wizards Unite}}
'''Amorette Deneuve'''Â was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the foremost expert on [[Love Potion|love potions]] and [[Entrancing Enchantments|spells]]; she had many published works about [[Love]], among them, ''[[First Love, First Loss]]''.<ref name="WU">{{WU}} (see [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-1-foundables-spell this])</ref>

Even though he was originally of the opinion that Deneuve's work was "''sentimental blather''", [[Grim Fawley]] contacted Amorette Deneuve following the disappearance of his wife, [[Penelope Fawley|Penelope]].<ref name="WU"/>

==Behind the scenes==

* Shortly after the outbreak of the [[Calamity]] and the establishment of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]], [[Gareth Greengrass]] commented on an article in the [[Quibbler]] with the headline; ''"The [[Unspeakable|Unspeakables]] Expand in Secret! What Are They Hiding?''", and confirmed the truth of it, saying; "''We had a 143 year old retire because he kept forgetting everything - literally, everything. Another member wanted to go and write novels. So, we replaced them both - with [[Grim Fawley|Grim]] and [[Regina Rowle]].''"<ref>{{WU}}</ref> Considering that Amorette specialises in love, a topic studied in the [[Department of Mysteries]], it is possible that she is this second member they replaced, and that the content of her books pertains at least partially to declassified research material from back then.
