This '''male [[Auror]]''' was stationed at [[Hogwarts Castle]]'s [[Entrance Hall]] during [[June]] of [[1997]].

==Biography==
During the [[Battle of the Astronomy Tower]], when the [[Death Eaters]] burst through the [[Entrance Hall]] in their escape, this [[Auror]] was blown away by [[Severus Snape]] with a [[spell]] when his back was turned. He apparently had not noticed the [[Death Eaters]] in the [[Hogwarts Castle|Castle]].<ref name="HBPF">{{HBP|F}} Chapter 27</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{HBP|FA}}, this Auror is the only resistance Hogwarts offers to the rampaging group of [[Death Eaters]] who had moments earlier witnessed the murder of [[Albus Dumbledore]].
*He may also be either [[Proudfoot]] or [[Savage]], considering that Tonks was stationed in Hogsmeade alongside them and was called up to defend Hogwarts.
*Considering how quickly he was defeated when caught off guard by Severus Snape, it is also possible that this is a recast of [[John Dawlish]].
