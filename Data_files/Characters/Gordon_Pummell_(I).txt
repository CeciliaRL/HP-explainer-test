'''Gordon Pummell''' was a [[wizardkind|student]] who began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] between [[1987]] and [[1989]].

==Biography==
By the [[1993-1994 school year]], he had been made a [[Prefect]], and was tasked with patrolling areas of the school off limits to students.

==Etymology==
''Gordon'' is derived from South Slavic word ''gord'', which means "dignified". It could relate to him being a Prefect, who is highly respected.

''Pummel'' is probably from the English word ''pummel'', which means "to strike repeatedly" or "to criticise adversely". It also has Latin roots that mean "fruit, apple".
