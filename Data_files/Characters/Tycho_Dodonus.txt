{{Quote|A son cruelly banished<br/>Despair of the daughter<br/>Return, great avenger<br/>With wings from the [[water]].|A prophecy from ''[[The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus]]''|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}
'''Tycho Dodonus''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] of unknown nationality and an accomplished [[Seer]], who prophesied in verse.<ref name="COG45">{{COG|S|45}}</ref> At some point, many, if not all of Dodonus's [[Prophecy|prophecies]] were compiled in a book called ''[[The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus]]''.<ref name="COG45"/>

Apparently, Tycho Dodonus's prophecies were not universally accepted; [[Porpentina Goldstein]] dismissed his work as nothing more than poetry, a notion that [[Yusuf Kama]] did not seem to challenge,<ref name="COG45"/> even though he evidently was a firm believer in the prophecies nonetheless.<ref name="COG103">{{COG|S|103}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*"Tycho" is derived from the Greek "Τυχων" meaning "hitting the mark". It is also derived from "Tyche", the Greek goddess of luck.
*"Dodonus" is derived from "Dodona", a location in Greece that was the seat of one of Zeus' oracles.

==Behind the scenes==
*Tycho Dodonus may be reference to {{w|Nostradamus}}, a 16th-century French physician and reputed seer who published ''{{w|Les Propheties}}'', a collection of quatrains that, allegedly, accurately predicted many major world events.
*The name Tycho may be taken from the Danish astronomer, Tycho Brahe, who in his lifetime also had been a astrologer. Brahe had once made out a horoscope for King Frederick II of Denmark's son, the future King Christian IV.
