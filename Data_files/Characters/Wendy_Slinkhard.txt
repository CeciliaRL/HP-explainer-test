==Behind the scenes==
*Wendy appears only in {{HBP|FA}} and is portrayed by [[Nina Aimer Fox]].
*It is possible, as a former [[Slug Club]] member, she attended the [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] in [[1996]].

==Etymology==
In the case of the character from J. M. Barrie's play ''Peter Pan'' (1904), the name "Wendy" was created from the nickname fwendy "friend", given to the author by a young friend. However, the name was used prior to the play (rarely), in which case it could be related to the Welsh name Gwendolen and other names beginning with the element gwen meaning "white, fair, blessed".
