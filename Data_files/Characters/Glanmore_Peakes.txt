'''Glanmore Peakes''' ([[1677]] – [[1761]]) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was famous for having slain the [[Sea Serpent of Cromer]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:Glanmore_Peakes.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Glanmore Peakes immortalised on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]
Peakes was born in 1677, in Scotland, [[Great Britain]].<ref name="PSG"/>

Sometime after graduating, Peakes killed the [[Sea Serpent of Cromer]], a [[sea serpent]] that lived off the shores of [[Cromer]], [[Norfolk]]. This led to his having a [[Chocolate Frog Card|Famous Wizard Card]] fashioned depicting him.<ref name="PSG"/><ref name="COSG"/><ref name="POAG"/>

There was a [[Glanmore Peakes' Corridor|corridor]] named after him on the sixth floor of [[Hogwarts Castle]], in which a portrait of him hangs. There was also a bust of Glanmore in the [[sixth-floor corridor]]. There was also a set of portraits of Peakes hiding a secret passage between the sixth-floor landing of the [[Grand Staircase]] and the [[Entrance Hall]] side room. The password to said passage was "''Sea Serpent''".<ref name="POAG PC">{{POA|G}} - PC version</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)|Console version]] of {{POA}}, Glanmore Peakes's portrait speaks in a pronounced Scottish accent.
*Glanmore may be related to [[Jimmy Peakes]], a student who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] from [[1994]] to [[2001]].
*It's unknown why Glanmore was featured on a famous wizard card for killing a Sea Serpent, as Sea Serpents are harmless creatures and are not dangerous to humans, according to [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]]. It is possible, however, that wizards were unaware of the fact at the time, or that the sea-monster was unwilling to move on elsewhere and had to be dispatched to prevent breaches of wizarding secrecy.
