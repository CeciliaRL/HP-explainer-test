'''Mathilda Greenford''' was a [[Slytherin]] [[Wizardkind|student]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]]. She was seen walking around the school during the [[1993-1994 school year]].

==Etymology==
*"Mathilda" is a variation of the name "Matilda", deriving from the Old High German words ''mahta'', meaning "might", and ''hildr'', meaning "battle".
*"{{w|Greenford}}" is the name of a suburb of the {{w|London Borough of Ealing}}. The suburb's name derives from the Old English ''grÄ“ne'' and ''ford'', together meaning "place at the green ford". (A "ford" is a part of a river which is shallow enough to cross without a bridge, and "green" in the context of place-names usually means a grassy field, especially a common.)
