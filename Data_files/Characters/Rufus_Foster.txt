==Biography==
Foster censured a [[wikipedia:grand jury|grand jury]] investigating [[Prohibition]] violations for leaking a sealed letter to the press on [[6 December]] [[1926]].<ref name="fb-chronicle" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> This letter was written by jury foreman [[W. de S. Trenholm]] and intended to be read only by the judge.<ref name="fb-chronicle" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> Foster summarily dismissed the grand jury, but was convinced by [[Clarke]], the Assistant District Attorney, to reconsider this action.<ref name="fb-chronicle" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> Thus, he instead ordered that the jury deliver any indictments they had found within three days, at which point their dismissal would take effect.<ref name="fb-chronicle" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> The incident was reported in the 6 December 1926 issue of the ''[[New York Chronicle]]''.<ref name="fb-chronicle" /><ref name="eveningworld" />

==Behind the scenes==
*The text of the article mentioning Rufus Foster in the [[:File:New York Chronicle - Monday Dec 1926 (HQ).png|prop issue]] of the ''[[New York Chronicle]]'' featured in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' was taken from the real [[21 November]] [[1922]] issue of ''[[wikipedia:The Evening World|The Evening World]]''. This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in [[1926]], but the actual historical event referenced happened in 1922.<ref name="eveningworld" />
