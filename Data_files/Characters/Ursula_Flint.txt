==Etymology==
[[File:Phineas Black.jpg|157px|thumb|left|Image of Ursula's son [[Phineas Black]] on the family tree]]
The name Ursula means "little bear", derived from the Latin word ''ursa'', "she-bear", which gives its name to [[Wikipedia:Ursa|two constellations]] associated with the Greek myth of Callisto, a nymph who was turned into a [[bear]]. Saint Ursula was a legendary Roman-British princess who was martyred by the Huns while returning from a pilgrimage in the fourth century.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/ursula Behind the Name: Ursula]</ref>
