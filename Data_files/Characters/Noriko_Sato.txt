'''Noriko Sato''' (さとう のりこ) was a Japanese [[wizardkind|witch]] who played as the [[Seeker]] for the [[2014]] [[Japanese National Quidditch team]]. She played in the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]].

==Biography==
During the seventh round match of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]], against [[Polish National Quidditch team|Poland]], Sato narrowly beat [[Polish National Quidditch team|Polish]] Seeker, [[Wladyslaw Wolfke]] to the Snitch in the 59th minute.<ref name="PM">{{PM}} - [[JAPAN VERSUS POLAND|JAPAN_VERSUS_POLAND]] (Archived)</ref>

Japan beat [[Nigeria]] 270 to 100 in the quarter-final match. The turning point of the game was the staggeringly powerful shot hit by [[Masaki Hongo|Hongo]], one of the Japanese [[Beater]]s, that smashed the tail off Nigerian Seeker [[Samuel Equiano]]'s broomstick. As Equiano span out of control, Sato soared through the middle of the action to seize the Snitch from the midst of distracted Nigerian players intent on saving their teammate in the 63rd minute.<ref name="PM"/>

Japan played [[Bulgaria]] in the semi-finals that took place on [[6 July]], but lost 610 to 460. The [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] was spotted early in the game but a series of events resulted in neither team catching it. [[Boris Vulchanov]], a Bulgarian Beater, deliberately intercepted a [[Bludger]] with his body to protect [[Viktor Krum]], the Bulgerian Seeker. Vulchanov was knocked out and fell from his broom, only to be saved by Sato. Krum, instead of taking advantage of Sato's temporary incapacitation, Krum pulled up and let the Snitch go by. All three were commended for their great sportsmanship after Vulchanov regained consciousness. The Snitch appeared for the second time and Sato raced against Krum, but lost. Krum, however, refused to catch it because his team was so far behind. Later, Sato was led to believe that Krum was escaping Hongo's line of sight when he had really spotted the Snitch and dived for it, leading Bulgaria to victory.<ref name="PM"/>
