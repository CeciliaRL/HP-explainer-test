{{Quote|Well, I've always felt an affinity with the great [[magic]]al [[bird]]s. There's a story in my family that a phoenix will come to any Dumbledore who is in desperate need. They say my great-great-grandfather had one, but that it took flight when he died, never to return.|[[Albus Dumbledore]]|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}
'''Mr Dumbledore''' was an individual that once owned a [[Albus Dumbledore's great-great-grandfather's phoenix|phoenix]], but it took flight when he died and never returned. He was an example of a story in the [[Dumbledore family]] that a phoenix would come to any Dumbledore who is in desperate need.<ref name="COG28">{{COG|S|28}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*[[J. K. Rowling]] has said that Fawkes had not served another human before Albus Dumbledore, meaning that these two phoenixes cannot be the same.<ref name="accio">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-edinburgh-ITVcubreporters.htm Edinburgh "cub reporter" press conference, ITV, 16 July 2005]</ref>
