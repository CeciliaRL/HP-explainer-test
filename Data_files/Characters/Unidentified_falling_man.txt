==Biography==
Born sometime prior to [[1994]], he attended the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], supporting [[Bulgaria]]. He attempted to flee when the [[Death Eaters]] came and began [[Levicorpus|levitating]] people and [[Fire-Making Spell|burning]] [[Charmed Tent|tents]], but was pushed back, falling to the ground and screaming. [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] and [[Hermione Granger]] witnessed the man's falling as they emerged from their [[Perkins's tent|tent]], but they did not try to help him. It is unknown what happened to him; he either managed to escape, was trampled by the crowd, or perhaps was [[Killing Curse|killed]] by the [[Death Eaters]].<ref name="GOFF">{{GOF|F}}</ref>
