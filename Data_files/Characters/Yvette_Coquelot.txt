'''Madame Yvette Coquelot''' (fl. [[1869]]) was a [[France|French]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] who presumably ran an establishment in [[69 Boulevard des Galantes]], in [[Paris]]. There was a plaque at [[The Seven Swans]] pub in [[Godric's Hollow]] requesting patrons to "discharge their weapons before entering", crediting Mme Coquelot as its original owner.<ref name="Potterish">[http://galeria.potterish.com/displayimage.php?album=4714&pid=211740#top_display_media "RdM - Fotos Oficiais de Cen√°rios e Objetos" (DH - Sets and Objects Official Photos)] at [http://galeria.potterish.com/index.php Galeria Potterish]</ref>

==Etymology==
*'''Yvette''' is the female form of the name Yves meaning Yew tree.
*'''Yvette''' is also Quebec term for a docile obedient housewife who votes against sovereignty [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_referendum,_1980#Brunch_des_Yvettes] [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Yvette].

*Coquelot is likely a contracted form of the word coquelicot or a variant of coquelet meaning small cockerel or male baby chick [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coquelet]. The word coquelicot means "poppy" since poppies are red like a rooster's chest [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/coquelicot].  The French word for rooster is coq.
