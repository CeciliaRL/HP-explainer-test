This '''individual''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] man, who served [[Little Hangleton]] in the capacity of milkman in the late [[20th century]].<ref name="LEGOY1">{{LEGO|Y1}} - Year 4</ref> 

==Behind the scenes==
*This individual replaces the role of [[Frank Bryce]] in {{LEGO|Y1}}. Despite this, it is highly likely that he still existed [[canon]]ically as the Milkman of Little Hangleton.
*Instead of noticing the lights on on the second floor, the milkman notices empty [[milk]] bottles on the front steps of the [[Riddle House]].
*His death at the hands of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] cannot be considered canonical, as no echo of him emerges from Voldemort's wand during the [[Duel in Little Hangleton]], and further in canon, it was Frank Bryce who was murdered during that incident.
