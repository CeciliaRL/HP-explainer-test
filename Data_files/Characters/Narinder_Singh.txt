'''Narinder Singh''' was a [[Fiji]]an [[wizardkind|witch]] who played as [[Beater]] for the [[2014]] [[Fijian National Quidditch team]].

==Biography==
During the second match of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]], against [[Nigerian National Quidditch team|Nigeria]], Singh and her fellow Beater [[Quintia Qarase]] "lacked the ferocity" of the Nigerian Beaters, [[Aliko Okoye]] and [[Mercy Ojukwu]]. This resulted in the [[Bludger]]s doing much harm to the Fijian [[Chaser]]s, which contributed to the team's bruising defeat.<ref name="PM">{{PM}} - [[NIGERIA VERSUS FIJI|NIGERIA_VERSUS_FIJI]] (Archived)</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on her name, it can be presumed that she was a Fijian of [[wikipedia:Indo-Fijians|Indian descent]].
