'''Ms Ross''' was a resident in [[Northumberland]]. She witnessed an [[Explosion in Northumberland|explosion]] on a Saturday morning while chatting with [[Stevens|Mrs Stevens]] and a [[Unidentified Muggle witness|Muggle]]. She was mentioned by her friend when he was interviewed by (unknown to him) a delegation from the [[British Ministry of Magic]]. 

The cause of the explosion was later revealed to be a [[Erumpent horn]] that had been dropped by a [[Unidentified wizard who dropped an Erumpent horn|wizard]]. It's unknown if Ms Ross, if not secretly a [[Wizardkind|witch]] herself, knew enough about the incident that she had to be [[Memory Charm|Obliviated]], although the friend who mentioned her was.<ref name="HM714A" />
