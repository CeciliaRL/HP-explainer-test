'''Senator Henry Shaw Junior''' (d. [[6 December]], [[1926]]<ref name="deathdate" />) was an [[United States of America|American]] [[No-Maj]] who served as a United States [[United States Senate|senator]] from [[New York]] during the [[1920s]].<ref name="SnitchSeeker">[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/fantastic-beasts-film-casts-jon-voights-son-senator-henry-shaw-seraphina-rumored-103245/ 'Fantastic Beasts' film casts Jon Voight's son, Senator Henry Shaw, Seraphina rumoured] at [http://www.snitchseeker.com/ SnitchSeeker]</ref> He was the son of newspaper magnate [[Henry Shaw Senior]].<ref name="description">"[http://www.fantasticbeastsmovies.com/ Full Character Descriptions]" from FantasticBeastsMovies.com</ref> He had at least one younger brother, [[Langdon Shaw]].

Henry Shaw Junior died on 6 December, 1926 after being attacked by [[Credence Barebone]]'s [[Obscurus]]. This was the result of a demeaning comment he made in regards to Credence. He was killed at a [[Henry Shaw Junior's fundraising dinner|fundraising dinner]] for his supporters at [[New York City Hall]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Henry Shaw Junior was born in the [[United States of America|United States]] in or before [[1890]].<ref name="age" /> His [[Henry Shaw Senior|father]] was a newspaper magnate, and he had at least one sibling: a younger brother named [[Langdon Shaw|Langdon]].<ref name="description" /> Shaw was elected to the [[United States Senate]] in [[1920]].<ref name="electiondate">Shaw was running for re-election to the [[United States Senate]] in [[1926]]. U. S. senators serve six-year terms, meaning that he would have been previously elected into office in [[1920]], although it's possible this wasn't his first term.</ref> As such, he was his father's pride and joy, while his brother was seen as a disappointment.<ref name="description" />

===Career===

[[File:Senator Shaw and Credence Barebone.png|thumb|200px|left|Henry Shaw Junior insulting Credence Barebone]]
In late [[1926]], his younger brother Langdon Shaw brought [[Mary Lou Barebone]] from the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]] and her adopted children [[Credence Barebone|Credence]], [[Chastity Barebone|Chastity]], and [[Modesty Barebone|Modesty]] to his father Henry Shaw Senior's office in [[Shaw Tower]].<ref name="FB38"/>

Langdon laid out a portfolio filled with a series of photographic evidence of [[magic|witchcraft]] and told his father of his belief that "strange things were going on all over [[New York]]" and that this was the work of witchcraft, certain that he was giving him the scoop of the century. Henry and his father both dismissed Langdon's claims as out of hand. Mary Lou was interested in garnishing the support and influence of his [[Shaw News|newspaper company]] and his elder son's re-election platform. Henry Shaw Senior refused and asked the [[Barebone family]] to leave. While they were departing, Mary Lou's adopted son Credence dropped a leaflet which Henry Shaw Junior handed back to him, unashamedly calling his family freaks.<ref name="FB38">{{FB|S|38}}</ref>

While running for re-election, Henry Shaw Junior held a [[Henry Shaw Junior's fundraising dinner|fundraising dinner]] for his supporters at [[New York City Hall]], which was also picketed by members of the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]].<ref name="description" /><ref name="fbmsite1">"[http://www.fantasticbeastsmovies.com/index.php/2015/10/21/video-scene-being-filmed-updated/ Video: Scene Being Filmed (UPDATED)]" from FantasticBeastsMovies.com</ref><ref name="fbmsite2">"[http://www.fantasticbeastsmovies.com/index.php/2015/11/20/pottermore-set-report-3/ Pottermore Set Report #3]" from FantasticBeastsMovies.com</ref><ref name="bleedingcool">"[http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/11/07/will-it-be-jk-rowlings-fantastic-beasts-or-fascist-beasts/ Will It Be JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts – Or Fascist Beasts?]" from Bleeding Cool</ref> When Henry was in the middle of his speech, he was interrupted by a strange, haunting noise coming from the organ pipes at the end of the room, and as he recommenced, the strange noise got louder, prompting the guests to look around for the source of the disruption and worriedly start muttering to each other.<ref name="FB60"/>

Suddenly, the chandeliers shattered and the lights went out, and a huge and bestial rush of wind burst forth from beneath the organ. The [[Obscurus]] of [[Credence Barebone]] soared across the hall, sending tables flying and throwing people around as it carved a line toward the stage where Shaw was still standing. The force threw Shaw backwards against his poster and then raised him up high where he was suspended for a moment midair before being thrown violently back down onto the stage, [[Death|dead]].<ref name="FB60"/>

After the attack, a magical image of Henry Shaw Junior's body was displayed in the [[Pentagram Office]] of [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] during a meeting of the delegation from the [[International Confederation of Wizards]]. [[Newton Scamander]] observed the body and realised that he was killed by an [[Obscurus]] from the marks covering his face.<ref name="FB60">{{FB|S|60}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Here you go, freak — why don’t you put that in the trash, where you all belong.|Henry Shaw Junior cruelly insults Credence Barebone|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
Henry Shaw Junior was a charismatic and successful politician. He was often arrogant, and could also be quite cruel to those he considered "freaks," as shown by his treatment of the [[Barebone family]], and the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society|Second Salemers]] as a whole. Henry was also quick to dismiss other people's beliefs, as shown when he ignored [[Mary Lou Barebone]]'s claims of witchcraft in New York City. Moreover, he appeared to enjoy his success in politics, as Henry was running for re-election, much to his father's pride. Henry appeared to be fairly conservative and authoritarian in his political beliefs, as during his re-election campaign, he expressed support for the maintenance of Prohibition laws. 

==Behind the scenes==
*Henry Shaw Junior is portrayed by [[Josh Cowdery]] in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''.<ref name="SnitchSeeker" />
*In the real world, the Class 3 (and, for that reason, up for re-election) Senator from New York in 1926 was [[Wikipedia:James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr|James Wolcott Wadsworth, Junior]] of the [[Wikipedia:Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], who had been in office since 1915 but was defeated for re-election by [[Wikipedia:Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Wikipedia:Robert F. Wagner|Robert F. Wagner]]. Unlike his fictional counterpart, Wadsworth Junior was vocally against [[Prohibition]], having even voted against the [[Wikipedia:Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Eighteenth Amendment]] when it was before the Senate in 1919.
*It is unclear if Shaw was a Democrat or Republican, although his attitude and several hints given in the film suggests the latter.
