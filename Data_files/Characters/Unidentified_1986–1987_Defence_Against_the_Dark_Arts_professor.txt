This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch or wizard]] who became the [[professor]] of [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], for the [[1986–1987 school year]].<ref name="HM37"/> 

They were considered far from an improvement of the [[Unidentified 1985-1986 Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher|previous year's professor]], which made [[Tulip Karasu]] wonder whether they would ever learn the [[Boggart-Banishing Spell]] if they continued to teach the subject.<ref name="HM37">{{HM|3|7}}</ref>

The professor was unable to continue teaching the subject in the next school year, because of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s [[Jinx on the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher|jinx]] which ensured the teacher of the subject would have needed to be replaced by the end of the year.<ref name="HM37"/>

According to [[Jacob's sibling]], this teacher was the worst out of their first five teachers.<ref name="HM5">{{HM|5}}</ref>
