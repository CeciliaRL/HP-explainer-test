==Etymology==
The name "Archibald" was derived from the Germanic elements ''ercan'' "genuine" and ''bald'' "bold". The first element was altered due to the influence of Greek names beginning with the element αρχος (''archos'') meaning "master". This name was brought to England by the Normans. It first became common in Scotland in the Middle Ages.
