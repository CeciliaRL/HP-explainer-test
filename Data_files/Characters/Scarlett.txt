'''Scarlett''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] friend of [[Penny Haywood]], who was killed by a [[werewolf]] in the summer of [[1985]].

==Biography==
Scarlett was presumably born around the same time [[Penny Haywood]] was born, in the late [[1960s]] or early [[1970s]], and was raised in the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] world. Every summer, Scarlett and her family would spend the holiday in the countryside, where they befriended Penny and her family.<ref name="HM">{{HM}}, Year 3, Side Quest "Penny for Your Thoughts"</ref>

In the summer of [[1985]], Scarlett and Penny snuck out of their house at night during the full-moon. They found a [[werewolf]] which fascinated Scarlett. Scarlett followed it while Penny followed them with her [[wand]] ready. Eventually, the werewolf noticed it was being followed and turned around. It killed Scarlett before Penny had time to react.<ref name="HM" />

Penny later blamed herself for Scarlett's death and decided to brew a [[Forgetfulness Potion]]. From then on, Penny's [[Boggart]] became the werewolf.<ref name="HM" />
