==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible this individual may be a relative of [[Chester Davies|Chester]] and [[Roger Davies]].
*It is uncertain whether the script writers intended this individual to be Roger Davies, though if they did this would likely not be a canonical mention, as mentions of Roger in the books (and lack thereof in the sixth book) imply that he graduated the previous year.
