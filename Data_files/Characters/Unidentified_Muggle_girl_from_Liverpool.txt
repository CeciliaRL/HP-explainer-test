{{Quote|I once knew a Muggle girl from Liverpool with hair like spun silk. No light could resist it...|[[Albus Dumbledore]] upon seeing a billboard advertising [[Divine Magic]], in [[Surbiton Station]]<ref name="script">Mentioned on the [http://warnerbros2009.warnerbros.com/assets/screenplays/hpathbp_screenplay.pdf ''Half-Blood Prince'' script] released on the [http://warnerbros2009.warnerbros.com/#/movies/harrypotter/foryourconsideration/ Warner Bros. Awards website]</ref>}}

This '''[[Non-magic people|Muggle]] girl from [[Liverpool]]''' was someone that the late [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore]] took a fancy to in his youth. A woman featured on a [[Divine Magic]] billboard made [[Albus Dumbledore|Albus]] remember about this girl.<ref name="script" />

{{Quote|In fact, recently I was in a script read through for the sixth film, and they had [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] saying a line to [[Harry Potter|Harry]] early in the script saying I knew a girl once, whose hair... [laughter]. I had to write a little note in the margin and slide it along to the scriptwriter, "[[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]'s gay!" |[[J. K. Rowling]]}}

*This character was created to be mentioned in {{HBP|FA}} by her former boyfriend, [[Professor]] Dumbledore. However, the character was cut from the film when [[J. K. Rowling]] scribbled out her mention in the script and revealed that Dumbledore was gay. As such, this character is not considered to be [[canon]].<ref>[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/10/20/j-k-rowling-at-carnegie-hall-reveals-dumbledore-is-gay-neville-marries-hannah-abbott-and-scores-more J. K. Rowling at Carnegie Hall]</ref>
*Rowling's note about this character marked the first time that Dumbledore was "outed", although Rowling does not directly indicate his orientation in any of the books beyond her subtle hints in {{DH}}.
