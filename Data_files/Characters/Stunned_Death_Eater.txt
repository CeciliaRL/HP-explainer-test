{{Quote|Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed...|Mention.|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
This '''[[Dark Wizard]]''' was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] who served [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]].

==Biography==
Born in or before the [[1980s]], most likely to a [[Pure-blood|pure]] or [[half-blood]] family, he procured a [[wand]] and was trained in the [[magic]]al arts, possibly at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

He met [[Tom Riddle]] sometime before [[May]], and formally became a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and one of his loyal servants.

On the [[1 May]] in [[1998]], this Death Eater was called upon to fight in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] in [[Scotland]].

Sometime throughout the battle, he was [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] by [[Harry Potter]] in the [[Viaduct Courtyard]].<ref>{{DH|B|31}}</ref>

His fate is unclear, though it is probable that he was killed in battle, abandoned the battle or else captured and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for his crimes as a Death Eater.

==Physical appearance==
This man had a small black moustache, short black hair, and narrow eyes. He was of an average height and build, with Caucasian skin flushed from the battle. He wore a pair of black boots and a black cape, as well as a shirt that, right before he was Stunned, shone brightly.

==Personality and traits==
If his membership as a Death Eater reveals his personality, he was a cruel, sadistic individual and a [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacist]], with him also being cunning, yet not entirely as intelligent as other Death Eaters, as he was easily stunned by Harry Potter off-guard, implying he was perhaps somewhat inattentive.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Being a Death Eater, he would have been an accomplished [[Dark Wizard]] who was highly proficient in dark magic and with the casting of [[dark charm]]s, most likely including the [[Unforgivable Curses]].
*'''[[Duelling]]''': As this Death Eater fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] against the defenders of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], he would have been a fairly competent duellist with some skill in [[martial magic]], but he was not skilled enough to avoid being [[Stunning Spell|stunned]] off-guard by Harry Potter, a far superior duellist.
