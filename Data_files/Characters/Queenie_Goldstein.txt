After graduating from Ilvermorny, Queenie acquired a desk job in the [[Wand Permit Office]],<ref name="FBS">{{FB}}</ref> within the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]].

While initially on the same side as her sister Tina and friend, later brother-in-law [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], Queenie was ultimately swayed to join [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s side with the offer to be free to love and marry her [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] boyfriend [[Jacob Kowalski]], as well as the offer to provide his freedom to others.

{{Quote|Teenie — you brought men home?|Queenie meets Newt Scamander and [[Jacob Kowalski]]|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them}}[[File:Tine and Queenie Goldstein.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Queenie and her sister in their brownstone]]

===Global wizarding war===
====Making new friends====
In [[1926]],<ref name="pottermore-everything" /> Queenie was sharing a [[wikipedia:Brownstone|brownstone]] at [[679 West 24th Street]] in [[New York|New York City]] with her sister<ref name="macusaid" /><ref name="collider">"[http://collider.com/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-things-to-know/?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=collidersocial ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’: 43 Things to Know about the New Wizarding World Story]" from Collider</ref><ref name="entertainmentweekly1">"[http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-characters/2368643_alison-sudol-queenie-goldstein 'Fantastic Beasts' Character Descriptions Revealed]" (Queenie Goldstein) from ''Entertainment Weekly''</ref> when the pair were introduced to the soon-to-be-famous [[Great Britain|British]] [[magizoologist]] and author [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] and [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] [[Jacob Kowalski]]. She took quite a liking to Jacob, as he was the first No-Maj she had ever had a decent conversation with (even if most of them were read by her). She was rather upset when she and Tina found that the men had left with [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|the suitcase]] in the middle of the night, especially after she made them cocoa.

The next day, while bringing coffee to a meeting room, she suddenly dropped the tray, breaking the glasses, when she realised Tina was to be executed. Whether it was by instinct or her Legilimency, she knew the danger Tina was in, as well as Newt.
[[File:Fantastic-beasts-Queenie jacob escape.jpg|250px|thumb|Queenie helping Jacob escape a MACUSA guard]]
While on her way to find Tina, she spotted Jacob being escorted by [[Sam (Obliviator)|Sam]], an [[Obliviator]]. She originally offered to "obliviate" Jacob because someone called for Sam, but he caught her bluff, as that wasn't part of her department. Queenie then resorted to blackmail, threatening to tell [[Cecily]] that he's been seeing [[Ruby (witch)|Ruby]]. Hastily, Sam left, leaving Queenie with Jacob. The two managed to break into [[Percival Graves's office|Graves' office]] and retrieved Newt's suitcase and his and Tina's wands. When they finally caught up to an escaped Newt and Tina, Queenie ordered all three of them to get into the case. As she was the only one of them who wasn't wanted, she safely smuggled them and the suitcase out of MACUSA, with the excuse that she was heading home because she felt ill. When her supervisor [[Abernathy]] asked what the suitcase was for, she told him it was "lady things" and he questioned her no further.

[[File:FB-queenie&jacob.jpg|240px|thumb|left|Queenie and Jacob inside The Blind Pig]]
After regrouping and devising a plan, the group headed for [[The Blind Pig]]. Before they gained entry, Queenie and Tina used magic to make them look more presentable for the speakeasy. When they entered, Queenie and Jacob shared some [[gigglewater]], while Newt and Tina negotiated with [[Gnarlak]]. After he revealed a possible creature located near [[Macy's]], the MACUSA showed up, revealing Gnarlak's betrayal. Queenie noted that the wanted signs behind her changed to the faces of Newt and Tina. She was delighted when she witnessed Jacob knock out Gnarlak. The group than [[Apparition|Apparated]] away.

When they arrived at [[Ginzberg Delaunay]], they spotted the [[Demiguise]], who eventually led them to the storeroom, where an escaped [[Occamy]], immense in size, had been residing. Queenie slowly approached the creature but accidentally kicked a Christmas ornament, disturbing the Occamy. Terrified, she and Jacob looked for cover as it attacked. The group then tried to find an insect and a teapot, as Newt ordered. While looking, Queenie was knocked down by the Occamy. She then watched as Jacob threw a cockroach into the teapot that Tina found, and the Occamy flew directly into the teapot, shrinking in size, to devour the insect.

[[File:Queenie inside case.jpg|250px|thumb|Queenie while inside Newt's suitcase notices a picture of [[Leta Lestrange]]]]
Finally, all the creatures were caught and safe. Tina and Queenie marvelled at Newt's suitcase and his creatures. While there, Queenie noticed a picture of Leta Lestrange inside Newt's shed. Through her natural talent for Legilimency, she extracted the story between Leta and Newt despite his discomfort and embarrassment. She told Newt that "she was a taker, you need a giver". When Tina showed up and asked what they were talking about, she said they were talking about school. She then tells Jacob and Newt that she and Tina went to [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]], while Newt says he went to Hogwarts, which he believes is the best wizarding school. Queenie pronounced such a belief "Hogwash". Before anyone can say anything else, the [[Thunderbird]] interrupted, as, according to Newt, he sensed danger.

====Obscurial attack on New York City====
[[File:Queenie and Jacob 2 FBF.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Queenie and Jacob share a brief, yet passionate kiss]]

The group then witnessed the [[Obscurial]] cause havoc across the city. Newt gave his suitcase to Tina and asked her to watch after his creatures. He then apparated away. Worried for Newt's safety, Tina hastily handed the suitcase to Queenie as she followed Newt through her own apparition. Unable to let her sister go, Queenie was about to repeat the pattern, but she was stopped by Jacob. Although resistant to his pleas, she read his mind and understood what he went through during the war.

Eventually, Tina and Newt found Queenie and Jacob after the apparent death of Credence and the arrest of Graves, who was actually [[Revelio Charm|revealed]] by Newt to be [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. Queenie pushed through the crowd to hug her sister, relieved to see her sister alive. She then witnessed the breathtaking moment when [[Frank (Thunderbird)|Frank]] took the [[Swooping Evil venom]] to the raining sky to contaminate the water, therefore Obliviating every No-Maj of the incident. The happy ending is short-lived, however, when they received orders that Jacob had to be [[Memory Charm|Obliviated]] as well. Queenie tried to convince Jacob to let her go with him, but he refused, thinking that there are other men like him. She strongly disagreed, saying that he was the only one. After the tearful goodbye with the group, Jacob entered the rain. Queenie managed to gently kiss him before he "woke up".

====Reunion with Jacob Kowalski====
[[File:Queenie Goldstein in Jacob's bakery FBF.jpg|250px|thumb|Queenie standing in Jacob's bakery]]
A few months later, Jacob had opened the successful bakery of his dreams, with [[pastry|pastries]] that resembled some of the magical creatures he encountered with Newt and the Goldstein sisters. One day, Queenie entered the shop in her usual pink attire, and Jacob's memories were rekindled as he touched his neck where the [[Murtlap]] bit him and he smiled. However, the true reason of his memory being restored is because of the venom, which only erases bad memories.

Around September [[1927]], Queenie travelled with Jacob to [[London]] to visit Newt. She announced that she and Jacob were engaged and planned to be married. Newt noticed Jacob's odd behaviour and realised he had been enchanted by her, using a powerful love charm. After a brief argument, Queenie agreed, and Newt [[surgito|lifted]] the spell. Jacob refused to marry her, fearing that she would be punished for marrying a no-Maj.

====Joining Grindelwald's Army====
[[File:Vinda Queenie.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Queenie in one of the Paris' streets, moments before her life changes forever]]
Rejected by Jacob, Queenie left for [[Paris]], where her currently estranged sister was researching hints about [[Credence Barebone]]'s whereabouts. Queenie went to the [[French Ministry of Magic]] with her [[Queenie Goldstein's suitcase|suitcase]] trying to find her sister but couldn't find the [[Porpentina Goldstein's postcard to Queenie Goldstein|postcard]] her sister had given to her. Being rejected for the second time, all alone, she soon left lost and distraught, after hearing [[Bonbon|thoughts]] of [[Jacob Kowalski]] on a [[Parisian back street|street]], [[Vinda Rosier]] approached the upset Queenie in the rain and came to her help, and invited her for [[tea]].<ref name="COGS52">{{COG|S|52}}</ref> 

[[File:Vinda talking with Queenie.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Queenie Goldstein speaking with Vinda Rosier]]
When Queenie informed she needed to leave, Rosier introduced her to [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s ideals, and to Gellert himself. Queenie initially showed a strong hostility towards the dark wizard and even raised her wand to him, but he reassured her he meant no ill will towards her and wished to be her friend. Grindelwald convinced her to join his cause by leveraging over her loving and compassionate nature, hinting that in a world where [[Wizardkind]] must no longer hide, she would be free to love Jacob and that his [[Wizarding world]] would have no place for [[Rappaport's Law]].

[[File:Queenie-Grindelwald.png|250px|thumb|left|Queenie joining Grindelwald]]
As such, Queenie attended Grindelwald's meeting [[Lestrange Mausoleum]], giddily hearing about him describe the muggles as merely different, to protect from themselves and not oppress, and told [[Jacob Kowalski]] (who was warned of her presence there by [[Nicolas Flamel]]) that by joining Grindelwald they could finally be together. Jacob refused, leaving her heartbroken, but she still went away with Grindelwald to [[Nurmengard Castle]], clinging on her hope of a future with Jacob as her husband. 
[[File:Grindelwald and Queenie at Nurmengard.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Queenie with Grindelwald at Nurmengard]]
Once established at Nurmengard, using her skills as a legillimens, she acted as an advisor to Gellert Grindelwald, telling him what [[Credence Barebone]] was wanting to hear to join his cause. Due to her loving nature, she would have provided much-needed support and guidance to the confused and broken young wizard.

==Physical appearance==
Queenie was a stunning witch with blonde hair.<ref name="hair" /> She was noted for her beauty, being described as a "bombshell".<ref name="boston" />

==Personality and traits==
Queenie was a free-spirited, kind-hearted woman.<ref name="entertainmentweekly1" /> She was very empathetic and skilled in the art of [[Legilimency]], which sometimes affected her relationship with others, but deepened the one she shared with her sister.<ref name="pottermore-everything" /><ref name="entertainmentweekly1" /><ref name="PottermoreInterview">[https://www.pottermore.com/news/fantastic-beasts-alison-sudol-interview-playing-queenie Queenie's powers are 'a lot to take on', says actress Alison Sudol]</ref> She was also considered to be "very brave."<ref name="PottermoreInterview" /> Queenie was unperturbed by the prejudice of her fellow wizards towards [[Non-magic people|No-Majs]], as ferociously evidenced by her relationship with [[Jacob Kowalski]], and her empathy towards him. Having been sorted into [[Pukwudgie (House)|Pukwudgie]], Queenie was incredibly kind towards people she realised were in pain or torment, as shown by how she consoled [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] about his relationship with [[Leta Lestrange]] - stating that Leta was a taker, whilst he needed a giver.

However, it was ironically Queenie's love and compassion towards others that induced her to [[Alliance|join]] [[Gellert Grindelwald]], who managed to persuade her that under his new world order, she and others would have a newfound freedom to love whomever they wish, since laws like [[Rappaport's Law]] would be abolished by him. Moreover, Grindelwald's [[Seer]] intention to fight against the future [[Second World War]] of the [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], appealed to Queenie's peaceful personality. Hence, Queenie agreed with Grindelwald's ideology so much, that she was even willing to stick with Grindelwald after her boyfriend [[Jacob Kowalski]] tearfully refused to join her, and sadly accused her new fanaticism as "crazy". While certainly heartbroken at losing Jacob, Queenie not only still believed that she can still have a future with Jacob as her husband but also saw in the importance of the free love cause which she could not yet have for herself, and she thus accompanied [[Gellert Grindelwald]] to [[Nurmengard Castle]].

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Dialogue a-b|Newt Scamander|You're a Legilimens?|Queenie|Mm. Yeah. But I always have trouble with your kind; Brits. It's the accent.|Queenie discussing her Legilimency talent|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
*'''[[Legilimency]]''': Queenie was an extremely accomplished Legilimens, who could relatively easily look deep down into the story of someone if she really wanted to. However, an [[Occlumency|Occlumens]] of immense power (like [[Gellert Grindelwald]]) was able to fully conceal his true thoughts from her, as Queenie was unable to see through his [[Percival Graves]] disguise.<ref>https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/809361237054201856</ref> Queenie was said to have a natural talent at Legilimency and did not need any training at all.<ref>https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/status/811588195309723650</ref> However, she claimed to have "trouble" in controlling it at times, such as when she passively read the thoughts of an emotional [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], and when reading the minds of individuals with strong foreign accents in English, such as the British wizards, and the French [[Vinda Rosier]], while the latter two were thinking in English. Moreover, Queenie's Legilimency is not a helpful tool for finding people, since when she notably tried to find [[Jacob Kowalski]]'s thoughts in [[Paris]] after briefly hearing them once, Queenie instead ended up painfully overwhelmed by the thoughts of the many people around her.
*'''[[Love]]''': Queenie, as a member of the house [[Pukwudgie (House)|Pukwudgie]], was an extremely loving person, and her immense love and compassion for people was strongly reflected in her [[magic]], given her capability to cast a very powerful love enchantment on her then-boyfriend [[Jacob Kowalski]], possibly an [[Entrancing Enchantments|Entrancing Enchantment]], in order to persuade him to get engaged as soon as possible, since otherwise Jacob did not wish to legally endanger his beloved by marrying her. Ironically, Queenie would become fanatically loyal to [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s cause mainly because the [[Dark Wizard]] had skilfully appealed to her feelings of love and compassion, promising to make his ''[[For the Greater Good]]'' new world order a more compassionate one, and that the horrifying future [[Second World War]] of the [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] would be fought against. Despite being an acolyte of Grindelwald, Queenie was as compassionate as ever towards the [[Obscurial]] [[Credence Barebone|Aurelius Dumbledore]], telling Grindelwald how to best appeal to the troubled young man while at [[Nurmengard Castle|Nurmengard]].
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Queenie told [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] and [[Jacob Kowalski]] that her job at MACUSA mainly involved "[[Counter-jinx|unjinxing]] the john" and making coffee. Additionally, when she unknowingly visited Grindelwald's safe house in Paris, she raised her wand to him when suddenly approached by Grindelwald, implying she was confident she could defend herself against the greatest [[Dark Wizard]] of the time long enough to escape, most likely with [[duelling]] and [[martial magic]], although Grindelwald, who had most likely seen her abilities in defensive magic when he was Percival Graves, did not appear to be threatened by this notion.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Queenie appeared to be very talented at charms, as she not only casually and effortlessly used several [[Household magic|household spells]] in quick succession to set the table for dinner when she and her sister had [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] and the No-Maj [[Jacob Kowalski]] for dinner, but she was also was an expert at preparing food with magic, notably by preparing a strudel with a wave of her wand. Indeed, Queenie's [[food-related charms]] were good enough to greatly impress the latter guest, who was himself a highly talented baker. In addition to know some basic opening spells, including the [[Unlocking Charm]] and ''[[Opening Charm|Aberto]],'' she could also cast an [[Umbrella spell]] to shield her from the rain laced with [[Swooping Evil venom]] when saying goodbye to Jacob. She was also capable of casting a highly potent love enchantment on her boyfriend Jacob Kowalski to bewitch him into proposing, the effects of which had a profound effect on his mental condition, further showing her impressive proficiency for charms-work.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': Queenie had some skill in this notably complex branch of magic, notably being able to transfigure her clothing into a dress before entering the [[The Blind Pig|Blind Pig]] speakeasy.
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Queenie, like most adult wizards and witches, was capable of Apparating with relative ease.<ref name=""LEGOD">{{LEGO|D}}</ref>
*'''[[Wandless magic|Wandless]] and [[Nonverbal spell|nonverbal magic]]''': Queenie could use Legilimency by merely looking at a person, without speaking the incantation, and without [[Queenie Goldstein's wand|her wand]]. Moreover, Queenie was also able to prepare a meal for four people in mere moments without uttering a single word. Additionally, she was able to wordlessly transfigure her clothing into a dress. This implies she was a highly powerful, skilled and accomplished witch, as both non-verbal and wandless magic are extremely difficult to perform.

==Possessions==
[[File:Queenie Goldstein wand.png|155x155px|thumb|Queenie Goldstein's wand]]

{{Quote|That’s got to be the closest thing to a sexy wand I’ve ever seen.|Description of Queenie's wand|Pottermore}}
*'''[[Queenie Goldstein's wand|Wand]]''': Queenie's [[wand]] was made from an unknown [[Wand wood|wood]] and [[Wand core|core]], and was of unknown length. It was described as "sexy" and had an [[Art Deco]]-inspired design.<ref>{{PM}} - [https://www.pottermore.com/news/interview-with-molly-sole-fantastic-beasts-wand-designer News: "Meet wand designer Molly Sole: a real-world Ollivander", by The Pottermore Correspondent]</ref> The handle was in the shape of a shell and made of mother of pearl.
*'''[[Chadwick's Charms]]''': A seven-volume series of [[Charms (class)|Charms]] textbooks written by [[Chadwick Boot]] and used at [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina]] and Queenie Goldstein owned these books while living in an apartment together.
*'''[[The Witch's Friend]]''': A monthly [[United States of America|American]] [[wizardkind|wizarding]] women's interest magazine that was published in the early [[20th century]]. [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina]] and Queenie Goldstein apparently subscribed to this magazine, owning the [[September]] [[1925]] issue.
*'''[[The Flap of the Cape]]''': A wizarding book written by [[Abigail R. Cankus]]. [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina]] and Queenie Goldstein owned these books while living in an apartment together.
*'''[[The Owl Airforce: True Life Tales of War in Europe|The Owl Airforce]]''': A wizarding book by [[Simon Dentata]].

==Etymology==
Queenie is an affectionate name derived from the term queen, which is thought to be derived from the Old English word "cwen". Goldstein is an occupational German name and an Ashkenazi Jewish surname, meaning "gold" with Stein being translated to "stone".

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:QueeniePOP.jpg|150px|thumb|Queenie Goldstein as as a [[POP! Vinyl]]]]
*Queenie is portrayed by [[Alison Sudol]] in the ''[[Fantastic Beasts (film series)|Fantastic Beasts]] ''film series.<ref name="alison">"[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/harry-potter-spinoff-fantastic-beasts-807570 'Harry Potter" Spinoff 'Fantastic Beasts' to Star Singer-Songwriter Alison Sudol]" at [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/ The Hollywood Reporter]
</ref>
*It is possible that Queenie's first name originates from Rowling's list of Hogwarts students ("The Original Forty") written early on in the development of the books, some of which never appeared anywhere in the series. One such name is "Queenie Greengrass.", who was later renamed, Daphne.
*There is a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] named [[Quentin Kowalski]] who may be a descendant of Queenie Goldstein and [[Jacob Kowalski]]. Their marriage would have been in violation of [[Rappaport's Law]] in the [[1920s]], but they could have left the country to marry or been married secretly. The law was repealed in 1965, after which Queenie and Jacob would have been free to live openly in the [[United States of America]] as husband and wife with their descendants.
