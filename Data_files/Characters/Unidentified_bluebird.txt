This '''bluebird''' (d. [[1993]]) was seen flying inside the [[Clock Tower Courtyard]], through the [[Wooden Bridge]], down the lawn, buzzing around [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s head, and flew around until it came too close to the [[Whomping Willow]], which whacked it hard, killing it.<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}}</ref>
