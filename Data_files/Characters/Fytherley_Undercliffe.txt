{{Quote|Virtutes, Archangeli, Angeli, Principatus, Dominationes, Seraphin, Cherubin, Throni.|Inscription on Professor Undercliffe's portrait|Harry Potter Limited Edition}}
'''Professor Fytherley Undercliffe''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] and a [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[16th century|sixteenth century]].<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE|PA}}</ref>

Undercliffe had a [[portrait]] that was painted in [[1531]].<ref name="HPLE" /> It was hung in the [[Headmaster's Office]] at Hogwarts after his death.<ref name="HPLE" /><ref name="DOD" />

==Behind the scenes==
*The portrait seems to be a direct reference to [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Archdeacon_by_Repin.jpg an 1877 portrait of an Orthodox protodeacon holding a walking stick], by [[Wikipedia:Ilya Repin|Ilya Yefimovich Repin]]. The same portrait appears at the [[Grand Staircase]] in {{POA|F}} when the [[Fat Lady]] is missing.
*On the DVD of {{COS|F}}, Professor Undercliffe's portrait is erroneously referred to as a portrait of "''Salazar Slytherin himself''". Why this mistake was made is, as of yet, unclear.
*The inscription on Professor Fytherley Undercliffe's portrait frame, "''Virtutes, Archangeli, Angeli, Principatus, Dominationes, Seraphin, Cherubin, Throni''" are all names of eight [[Wikipedia:Christian angelic hierarchy|hosts of angels]].
