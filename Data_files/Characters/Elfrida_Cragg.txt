'''Elfrida Cragg''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]], whose [[portrait]] hung at the [[British Ministry of Magic Headquarters|Headquarters]] of the [[British Ministry of Magic]]. On [[18 December]] [[1995]], [[Everard]] went into her portrait to find out what happened to [[Arthur Weasley]] following the [[Attack on Arthur Weasley|attack]] on him by [[Nagini]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]].<ref name="OOTP22">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Elfrida" is from the Old English name ''Ælfþryð'', meaning "elf strength" from the element ''ælf'' combined with ''þryð'', "strength". ''Ælfþryð'' was a 10th-century queen of England. This name was rare after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 19th century.

==Behind the scenes==
*Elfrida Cragg is possibly a misspelling of [[Elfrida Clagg]]. This is likely, as Clagg was a celebrated Chieftainess of the [[Wizards' Council]], the organisation that preceded the Ministry of Magic in [[Great Britain|Britain]], and hence would be likely to have a portrait commemorating her at the Ministry.
