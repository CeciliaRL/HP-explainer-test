The '''Earl of Paunchley''' was a tyrannical [[England|English]] [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] noble who lorded over the village of [[Poppleton]], [[England]] in the late [[15th century]].<ref name="WBoS" />

==Biography==
The Earl of Paunchley lived in [[Castle of the Earl of Paunchley|a castle]] outside the village of [[Poppleton]], [[England]]. Noted for his cruel and tyrannical nature, he made life extremely difficult for the villagers, awarding harsh and excessive punishments for the smallest misdeeds: children caught eating [[Apple (fruit)|apples]] that had fallen from trees he owned received a beating, women who did not curtsy low enough when he walked by were [[Earl of Paunchley's forced servants|forced to work as servants]] at his castle, and men who dared to stand up to him were never seen again.<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}}</ref>

In [[1484]], the Earl decided to hold a [[jousting tournament]] on his castle grounds, in which he himself would compete. Nobles from the surrounding area were invited to attend. The entire village of Poppleton was also ordered to show up to watch the Earl compete, whether they liked it or not, as no excuses for absences would be accepted.<ref name="WBoS" />

One hour before the match was scheduled to start, [[Edmund Gaddlegate]], a young boy who the Earl had instructed to hang banners and pennants, fell out of a tree and broke his leg. His [[Edmund Gaddlegate's mother|mother]] put him to bed and sent word to the Earl that he would not be able to attend the match.<ref name="WBoS" />

The Earl responded by sending [[Earl of Paunchley's four burly servants|four burly henchmen]] to drag Edmund and his mother to [[Castle of the Earl of Paunchley|the castle]]. There, the Earl informed Edmund's mother that as punishment for his mistake, Edmund would be tied to a [[horse]] and forced to joust against him, as well as all the knights who had gathered to compete. However, when the knights learned that the Earl expected them to compete against an injured boy, they left in disgust, refusing to partake in the tournament. The Earl, furious, thus announced that he alone would joust against Edmund.<ref name="WBoS" />

As the Earl charged toward Edmund, a [[wizardkind|witch]] among the spectators, [[Hannah Cockleford]], cast a [[Shield Charm]] between them. Slamming into the spell, the Earl was knocked backwards, his horse landing on top of him. At first, the crowd thought he was dead, but he survived. However, for the rest of his life, he thought he was a [[donkey]] named Hairy Cyril, having apparently suffered some form of brain damage.<ref name="WBoS" />
