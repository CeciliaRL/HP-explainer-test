These eight [[Wizardkind|witches and wizards]] were siblings of [[Flora Buchanan|Flora]], [[Hamish Buchanan|Hamish]] and famed [[Rugby Union|rugby]] player [[Angus Buchanan]], and therefore children of [[John Buchanan|John]] and [[Mary Buchanan]]<ref name="PM">{{WW|scottish-rugby}}</ref>. The daughters among this group had won the village tug-of-war every year in living memory; all of the children were described as being "enormous" and "wild".<ref name="PM"/>

When Angus was disowned by their father upon being rejected by the [[Sorting Hat]] as he was a [[Squib]], he placed an edict upon them forbidding them from seeing or talking to their brother again.<ref name="PM"/> They, however, revolted, and attended his first rugby match, against [[England]], which he won.<ref name="PM"/>
