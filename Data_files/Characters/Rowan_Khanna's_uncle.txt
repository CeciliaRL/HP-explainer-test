This '''individual''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and the uncle of [[Rowan Khanna]].<ref name="HM45"/>

==Biography==
It can be presumed that he grew up in the [[Khanna Farms|family business]], as he knew enough about woodworking to become a top [[broom-maker]] as an adult. He apparently did very good, meticulous work and was very proud of it, since crafting a single broom would take him a few months and would cost a few thousand galleons. Rowan suggested they could ask his uncle to make one for [[Jacob's sibling]] after they learned the easiest way to enter the [[Forbidden Forest]] unseen was by flying. This suggestion was, however, too time-consuming and costly for it to go anywhere, as Rowan's friend ultimately borrowed a broom from someone else instead.<ref name="HM45">{{HM|4|5}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is unknown if this uncle and [[Ollie]],<ref>{{HM|3|Wizarding World Famous}} - mentioned if option ''"It's amazing"'' is chosen when asked about the contest.</ref> an uncle mentioned by name by Rowan, is the same man.
