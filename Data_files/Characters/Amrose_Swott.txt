{{Quote|Ora et Labora.|Professor Swott's motto, inscribed on his portrait|Harry Potter|Harry Potter Limited Edition}}
'''Professor Amrose Swott'''<ref name="HPLE"/> was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and was once a [[Hogwarts Headmaster]].<ref name="cosdvd">{{COS|F}} DVD (Disc 2 - ''Dumbledore's Office'') {{See image|File:Amberose.jpg}}</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:AmberoseSwott.jpg|200px|thumb|Amrose Swott as a younger man]]
===Lifetime===
Professor Swott lived in the early [[18th century]].<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE|PA}}</ref> He became the [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] at some point.

===Post-mortem===
Professor Swott died sometime in or prior to [[1992]].<ref name="DOD" /> Two [[portrait]]s of him hung at Hogwarts: one depicted a [[Glasses|bespectacled]] young man,<ref>{{See image|File:AmberoseSwott.jpg}}</ref> and another, painted in [[1724]]<ref name="HPLE" /> and hung in the [[Headmaster's office]], depicted an older wizard with a long ginger beard.<ref name="cosdvd" /> Swott's name was also carved into a wood panel on the wall of the school's [[Divination]] [[Divination Classroom|classroom]].<ref name="poapanel">{{POA|F}} - {{See image|File:Amberose Swott.jpg}}</ref>

In the winter of [[1993]], Swott's name appeared on the [[Marauder's Map]],<ref>{{POA|F}} - Chapter 16</ref> presumably indicating that he lingered at Hogwarts as a [[ghost]] after his [[death]]<ref>In {{HBP}}, Chapter 24, Harry notices on the Marauder's Map that [[Draco Malfoy]] is in a boys' bathroom with [[Myrtle Warren]], thereby confirming that the Map shows ghosts.</ref> or that there is a student named after him.

==Etymology==
"Ambrose" is a name, which ultimately derives from the Greek name ''Ambrosios'', meaning "[[Immortality|immortal]]".<ref>"[http://www.behindthename.com/name/ambrose Ambrose]" on Behind the Name</ref> Swott may have been based on ''swot'', a British slang term, meaning "to study hard" or "one who studies hard."<ref>{{Wtlink|swot}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Swott's portrait is inspired by [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Attributed_to_Arnold_Bronckorst_-_James_Douglas%2C_4th_Earl_of_Morton%2C_about_1516_-_1581._Regent_of_Scotland_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg a portrait] of {{W|James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton}}.
*The portrait depicting a younger Swott has been based on a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9e/Godfrey_Kneller_Selfportrait.jpg 1685 self-portrait] of {{W|Godfrey Kneller|Sir Godfrey Kneller (1646-1723)}}.
*The [[motto]] inscribed on Swott's portrait, ''Ora et Labora'' (meaning "Pray and Work") was the motto of the {{W|Benedictine monk}}s.
