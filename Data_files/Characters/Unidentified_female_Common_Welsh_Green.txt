This unidentified '''Common Welsh Green''' was the female [[dragon]] that [[Fleur Delacour]] had to get past in the [[Triwizard Tournament|First Task]] of the [[1994]] [[Triwizard Tournament]]. Fleur attempted to put her into a [[bewitched sleep]] but was only partly successful. Fleur escaped with the tournament's [[golden egg]] but the dragon caught Fleur's skirt and set it on [[fire]] during the task.<ref name="GOF20">{{GOF|B|20}}</ref>
