==Etymology==
The name "Stewart" comes from an occupational surname originally belonging to a person who was a steward. It is ultimately derived from Old English stig "house" and weard "guard". As a given name, it arose in 19th-century [[Scotland]] in honour of the Stuart royal family, which produced several kings and queens of [[Scotland]] and [[Great Britain|Britain]] between the 14th and 18th centuries.
