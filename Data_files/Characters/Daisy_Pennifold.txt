==Biography==
In [[1700s|1711]], shortly after the change in colour of the [[Quaffle]], Daisy [[Spell creation|invented]] a [[Arresto Momentum|charm to slow the target's descent]] and used it on the Quaffle, allowing [[Chaser]]s to retrieve the ball while it was still in the air rather than having to dive to the ground. These [[Charm|enchanted]] Quaffles became known as "Pennifold Quaffles" and are still used in modern times.<ref name="QTA6">{{QTA|R|6}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Spell creation]]''': Pennifold succeeded in the very advanced and difficult [[magic]]al art of inventing new [[spell]]s, having successfully created the highly useful and practical [[Slowing Charm]].<ref name="QTA6"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Pennifold was highly accomplished and talented with charm-work, given how she successfully invented the [[Slowing Charm]].<ref name="QTA6"/>

==Etymology==
The name "Daisy" comes simply from the English word for the white flower, ultimately derived from Old English dægeseage meaning "day eye". It was first used as a given name in the [[19th century]], at the same time many other plant and flower names were coined.
