{{Quote|I can't believe they even let you in here after your mental brother got expelled, and ruined [house]'s reputation.|This boy to [[Jacob's sibling]] on the latter's first day of school.|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}This wizard started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in [[1982]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] in the same house as [[Jacob (Hogwarts student)|Jacob]], a student who was expelled while looking for the [[Cursed Vaults]]. The boy disliked Jacob to the extent that he considered him to have ruined their house's reputation.<ref name="HM1">{{HM|1|2}}</ref>

In his [[third year]], the [[Jacob's sibling|younger sibling]] of Jacob got sorted into the same house as him. Shortly after the Sorting ceremony, he confronted Jacob's sibling in their [[common room]] and expressed his dislike towards the sibling being in the same house as him. [[Rowan Khanna]] defended them. The boy then left, telling the two he would keep an eye on them.<ref name="HM1"/>
