==Behind the scenes==
*In the console version of {{COS|G}}, Punnet is credited as the wizard who wrote ''[[Hogwarts: A History|Hogwarts, A History]]''. However, a later film prop identifies the book's author as [[Garius Tomkink|Professor Garius Tomkink]], and {{WWHP}} ultimately presents [[Bathilda Bagshot]] as the author.
