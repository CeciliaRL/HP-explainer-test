'''Elizabeth Smudgling''' was a [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived in the late [[14th century]]. An accomplished [[Duelling|duellist]], she was, in the opinion of [[Miranda Goshawk]], the most likely [[Spell creation|inventor]] of the [[Disarming Charm]].<ref name="WBoS" />

==Biography==
Smudgling was born in [[England]] in the mid-to-late [[14th century]]. In [[1379]], she entered a [[1379 duelling contest|duelling competition]] held in [[Dartmoor]], in which [[wizardkind|wizards and witches]] from across [[Europe]] came to partake. According to contemporary reports, the contest (which was held at night, so as to avoid attracting the attention of [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]) featured duelling of a level of skill that was almost unprecedented.<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}}</ref>

Eventually, only four competitors remained, including Smudgling and three wizards. The [[Judges of the 1379 duelling contest|judges of the competition]] — distinguished [[warlock]]s and wizards from several different countries — delivered rousing speeches to the contestants before the final three duels commenced, telling them, "''Think big! Think bigger than you have ever thought before! Let us see this night magic on such a scale, that future generations will envy us for having witnessed such greatness!''"<ref name="WBoS" />

The first semi-finalists then moved in front of the crowd. Keeping in mind the judges' advice to think big, the [[First semi-finalist of the 1379 duelling contest|first wizard]] transformed himself into a [[Cattle|bull]] and charged the [[Second semi-finalist of the 1379 duelling contest|second]], who escaped [[death]] by quickly [[Human Transfiguration|turning]] himself into a [[snake|viper]]. The second wizard bit the first on the leg, sending him crashing to the ground in pain.<ref name="WBoS" />

Next, the [[Second semi-finalist of the 1379 duelling contest|second wizard]] faced the [[Third semi-finalist of the 1379 duelling contest|third]], and brought a great storm cloud down from the sky, drenching his opponent in freezing-cold [[Water|rain]] and forcing him to evade bolts of lightning. The third wizard then got the idea to call a powerful cyclone, which not only blew away the storm, but also the judges, most of the spectators and several trees.<ref name="WBoS" />

It took several hours for everyone to regroup. Frightened of what the third wizard might do for his encore, [[Judges of the 1379 duelling contest|the judges]] attempted to talk Smudgling out of challenging him, telling her that it might be easier if they simply gave him the cup before anyone else got hurt, but she refused.<ref name="WBoS" />

Smudgling and the [[Third semi-finalist of the 1379 duelling contest|third wizard]] then went up against each other. On the count of three, the wizard began a [[Mountain-moving spell|long, complex incantation that would have caused a mountain to break out of the ground]] and fall upon Smudgling's head had he been given the opportunity to complete it. However, Smudgling beat him to the punch, quickly murmuring the incantation for the [[Disarming Charm]] and sending his [[wand]] flying out of his hand. She was awarded the title of "[[Supreme Dueller]]" and the Disarming Charm became one of the most useful combative [[spell]]s in any duellist's repertoire.<ref name="WBoS" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Duelling]]''': Smudgling was a highly talented and accomplished duellist, having been awarded with the honorary title of "[[Supreme Dueller]]" for having won the [[1379 duelling contest]] in [[Dartmoor]], defeating many powerful [[Wizardkind|wizards]] in the competition.<ref name="WBoS" />
*'''[[Charm]]s''': She was able to swiftly and successfully cast the [[Disarming Charm]], which she used to disarm her opponents whilst duelling, allowing her to instantly win her duels. According to [[Miranda Goshawk]], she may have even [[Spell creation|invented]] his charm herself.<ref name="WBoS" />
