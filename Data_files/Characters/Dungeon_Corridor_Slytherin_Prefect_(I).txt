Let's go and wipe out Gryffindor!|The prefect speaking with [[Draco Malfoy]]|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)}}
This '''[[Wizardkind|wizard]]''' attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was a member of [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]].<ref name="POAG"/>

==Biography==
In his [[fifth year]], he was made a [[Prefect]], and, during the [[1993â€“1994 school year]], he often patrolled the [[Dungeon Corridor]] outside the [[Potions Classroom|Potions Dungeon]] with [[Dungeon Corridor Slytherin Prefect (II)|a fellow Slytherin Prefect]].<ref name="POAG"/>

He was in on [[Draco Malfoy]]'s plan of stealing the [[Quidditch]] crate from [[Rolanda Hooch]]'s [[Rolanda Hooch's office|office]] and switching it with one with [[jinx]]ed balls. He informed Malfoy after a [[Potions (class)|Potions]] lesson that [[Marcus Flint]] and [[Peregrine Derrick]] that they had acted on his plan and hidden the real crate in the [[Clock Tower]] [[Clock Tower Courtyard|Courtyard]]. They then proceeded to the [[Quidditch pitch|Quidditch stadium]].<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*As Draco implied that the prefect was part of the [[Slytherin Quidditch team]], as well as the fact that he knew about Draco's plan and that Flint and Derrick had acted upon it, it is possible that he was [[Adrian Pucey]] or [[Graham Montague]], whom he was similar in appearance to.
*The prefect was voiced by [[Lewis MacLeod]] in the video game adaptation of {{POA}}.
