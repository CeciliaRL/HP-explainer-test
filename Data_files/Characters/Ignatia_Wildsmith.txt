'''Ignatia Wildsmith''' ([[1220s|1227]]—[[1320s|1320]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and wizarding inventor, who was famously the creator of [[Floo Powder]]. During her childhood, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref name="pottermore" />

==Biography==
===Early life===
{{Quote|Ravenclaw house has an illustrious history. Most of the greatest wizarding inventors and innovators were in our house, including ''[…]'' Ignatia Wildsmith, the inventor of Floo powder.|[[Robert Hilliard]].|Pottermore}}
Ignatia Wildsmith was born in [[1227]],<ref name="PSg">{{PS|G}}</ref> somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]].

In her youth, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from around [[1230s|1238]] or [[1230s|1239]] to [[1240s|1245]] or [[1240s|1246]], where she was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

===Adulthood===

After her graduation from [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]], Ms. Wildsmith presumably studied further into [[Herbology]], and discovered the [[magic]]al properties of the [[Floo]] plant. From it, she devised a magical powder, [[Floo Powder]], which, when thrown into a [[fire]], could transport [[wizardkind|wizards]] from one fireplace to another via a [[Floo Network|network of fireplaces]].<ref name="PSg"/>

===Death and post-mortem===
Ms. Wildsmith died in [[1320s|1320]], aged around 93. In her honour, her achievement, the invention of the [[Floo Powder]], was recorded on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="PSg"/>

On [[1 September]], [[1991]], [[Prefect]] [[Robert Hilliard]] welcomed the [[Ravenclaw]] [[first year]]s to [[Ravenclaw Tower]] with a short speech in which he mentioned inventor Ignatia Wildsmith as one of the many notable Hogwarts students who had been [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]], like them, into [[Ravenclaw]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

==Etymology==
*"Ignis" is [[Latin]] for "[[fire]]".

==Behind the scenes==
*On her [[Chocolate Frog Card|Famous Wizard Card]], Ignatia's outfit bears a resemblance to [[w:c:disney:Maleficent|Maleficent]] from Disney's ''[[w:c:disney:Sleeping Beauty|Sleeping Beauty]]''. Throughout the film, Maleficent is associated with green flames, even using them to teleport herself. She also has [[w:c:disney:Diablo|a raven companion]], though this may be coincidental, as Ignatia was not revealed to be a Ravenclaw at the time the card was designed.
