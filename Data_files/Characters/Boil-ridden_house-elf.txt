{{Quote|And what luck! We have the ideal guinea pig, I mean, a poor soul who needs our [[potioneer]]ing expertise. A few drops of my brew should vanish those boils.|Zygmunt Budge suggests assisting this house-elf|Wonderbook: Book of Potions}}
This male '''[[house-elf]]''' worked for [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as one of their [[Hogwarts house-elves|staff of house-elves]]. He apparently had skin problems, as the house-elf had developed a terrible case of boils. [[Hogwarts potions champion|A Hogwarts student]], using the advice of the spirit of [[Zygmunt Budge]] possessing ''[[Book of Potions]]'', brewed a [[Cure for Boils]] [[potion]] that remedied this elf's skin affliction.<ref name="WBP">{{WBP}}</ref>
