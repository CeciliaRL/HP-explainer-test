At the trial held later in 1926, a [[Gibson|Mrs Gibson]] testified that, on the night of the murders, she saw Mrs Hall in [[De Russey Lane]] with a male companion.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> Mrs Gibson stated she was able to see their faces because of a passing [[car]].<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> [[George Sipel]] was subpoenaed to confirm her claim he was driving this vehicle.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> Mrs Gibson claimed that she had heard that Sipel had told his friend, [[John Garry]], that he had seen her on the night of the murders.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> Sipel denied this allegation and reportedly showed a "frantic eagerness" to avoid testifying.<ref name="fb-paper" /><ref name="eveningworld" /> The trial was reported on in the [[6 December]] 1926 issue of the ''[[New York Chronicle]]''.<ref name="fb-paper" />

==Behind the scenes==
*The text of the article mentioning Mrs Hall in the [[:File:New York Chronicle - Monday Dec 1926 (HQ).png|prop issue]] of the ''[[New York Chronicle]]'' featured in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' was taken from the real [[21 November]] [[1922]] issue of ''[[wikipedia:The Evening World|The Evening World]]''.<ref name="eveningworld" /> This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in [[1926]], but the actual events referenced occurred in 1922.
