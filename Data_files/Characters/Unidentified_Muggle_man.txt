On [[1 September]], [[1992]], a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] '''man''' in the parking lot of [[King's Cross Station]], was waiting for his train, and commented that he was going to have an enjoyable train ride whilst playing his [[Game Boy]] during the journey. He also ate some [[chips]] before his trip which gave him indigestion and made him burp.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}} - GBC version</ref>
