This '''individual''' attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1986]] and was a [[Chaser]] on a [[Quidditch]] team.

==Biography==
This individual started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1986]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into the same house as [[Jacob's sibling]].<ref name="HM614"/>

By their [[fourth year]], the individual had become a [[Chaser]] on their Quidditch team. During their fourth year, they fell three storeys off their [[Broomstick|broom]] and broke their nose. Because of this, they ended up in the [[Hospital Wing]]. Shortly after this incident, [[Poppy Pomfrey]] was petrified, and the Chaser left the Hospital Wing as it was evacuated.<ref name="HM614"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*This individual's house is the same as that of [[Jacob's sibling]], which is chosen by the player.
**This is similar to how characters in the Quidditch storyline (such as [[Skye Parkin]]) are in specific houses depending on the player's house. As such, it is possible this character will eventually appear as a teammate in a yet to be released Quidditch Season.
