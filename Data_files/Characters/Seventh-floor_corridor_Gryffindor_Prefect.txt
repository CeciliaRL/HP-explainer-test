He was patrolling the [[Seventh-floor corridor]] on the night of [[12 September]], [[1991]], the night when [[Draco Malfoy]] challenged [[Harry Potter]] for a [[duel|wizards' duel]] on the [[Trophy Room]] at midnight. As Harry was making his way there, he found this Prefect pacing back and forth and blocking the shortest route to the stairs.<ref name="PSgba"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*This NPC has the distinction of making its only appearance during the Midnight Duel level. Unlike the other [[Prefect]]s in night sneak missions, who are recurring and sometimes copies of sprites depicting first-year students during the day, this character makes a single appearance during the entire game.
