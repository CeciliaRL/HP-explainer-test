This '''individual''' was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] who, in his lifetime, was [[Head of Gryffindor House]].<ref name="MHP" />

==Biography==
A portrait of this wizard hung in [[Gryffindor Tower]]. In [[1994]], when [[Harry Potter]] opened his [[golden egg]] he was terrified and was seen holding his hands over his ears.<ref name="GOFF">{{GOF|F}}</ref> In [[1995]], he lamented the lack of a background in his picture, noting that the portrait of the [[Unidentified Gryffindor seeker|Quidditch Player]] on the opposite wall had an entire [[Quidditch pitch]].<ref name="OOTPG">{{OOTP|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*In the [[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{OOTP}}, he was credited as '''GCR Portrait Male 4''', and was voiced by [[Jonathan Kydd]]. His portrait also appears in the [[Gryffindor]] Common Room in the [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|video game adaptation]] of {{HBP}}, but does not speak.
