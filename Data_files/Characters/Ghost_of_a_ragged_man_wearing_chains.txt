{{Quote|They passed a group of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn't surprised to see that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other ghosts.|Description|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets}}
This '''ghost''' attended [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington]]'s [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party|five-hundredth Deathday Party]] on [[31 October]], [[1992]]. He stood around the edge of the dance floor, and wore chains.<ref name="COS8">{{COS|B|8}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is unknown if this ghost resided at [[Hogwarts Castle]] or if he only came there to celebrate Sir Nicholas's Deathday.
*The Ghost's description is reminiscent of the famous ghost created by [[Charles Dickens]], Jacob Marley from his novel ''A Christmas Carol''. It is possible that he ''is'', in fact, Marley; an interpretation of the Deathday Party scene holds that all the unnamed ghosts are actually sneaky cameos, with the [[Knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead]] being Harold II Godwinson, and the [[Portly ghost]] being Daniel Lambert, among other things.
