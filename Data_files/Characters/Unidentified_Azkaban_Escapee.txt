This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for an unknown crime.<ref name="FightingForces"/> 

==History==
[[File:Azkaban_Prisoner_Number_WU.png|thumb|left|This prisoner's Azkaban number plate]]
He was known to have escaped during one of the [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]]-led raids at the height of [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]â€™s reign, but otherwise, he was historically inconsequential.<ref name="FightingForces">{{WU}} "Brilliant Event: Fighting Forces"</ref>

In [[October]] [[2019]], however, [[Calamity|the Calamity]] chose to focus on him. As [[Constance Pickering]] found out, the number of the prisoner, also captured by the Calamity, belonged to this individual.<ref name="FightingForces"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that he is [[Gareth Greengrass]]' [[Gareth Greengrass' brother|brother]].
