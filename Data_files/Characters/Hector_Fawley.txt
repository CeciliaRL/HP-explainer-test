'''Minister Hector Fawley''' was [[Minister for Magic]] from [[1925]] to [[1939]].<ref name="PM"/>

==Biography==
Minister Fawley was voted in because of his marked difference to his predecessor, [[Lorcan McLaird]] — while the latter was taciturn and an unlikely politician, Fawley was ebullient and flamboyant in character.<ref name="PM"/>

His term in office coincided with the beginning of [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s [[Global wizarding war|"For the Greater Good" revolution]]. Fawley did not take Grindelwald's threat to the world wizarding community sufficiently seriously, and his lack of response was openly questioned. The [[Daily Prophet]] once asked in [[1926]], whether "Flamboyant Fawley" was doing enough.<ref name="FBF">{{FB|F}} - {{see image|File:Daily Prophet - 29 Nov 1926.png}}</ref>  

He was re-elected at least once, but the consequence of his lack of response to Grindelwald came in [[1939]], when he was forced from his office, being replaced with the more proactive [[Leonard Spencer-Moon]].<ref name="PM">{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>  

==Behind the scenes==
*Hector Fawley is the sitting Minister for Magic in Britain during the time setting of the films ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' and {{COG}}.
*While the "British Envoy" portrayed by [[Richard Clothier]] in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]'' was speculated to be Fawley as Newt addresses him as Minister, Clothier's agency lists his role as [[Hector Podmore]].<ref>[http://www.unitedagents.co.uk/richard-clothier United Agents - Richard Clothier]</ref>
*Hector Fawley's inability to properly respond to the threat Grindelwald posed seems to mirror real-life British Prime Minister [[Wikipedia:Neville Chamberlain|Neville Chamberlain]], who gave in to [[Wikipedia:Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler]] by signing the [[Wikipedia:Munich Agreement|Munich Agreement]] and announced "''peace in our time''" in 1938, shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Regardless of Chamberlain's other achievements, he went down in history as a bumbler.
*The Fawleys (Aubrey and Julia) are characters in [[J. K. Rowling]]'s novel ''[[The Casual Vacancy]]''. In that novel, they are a rich aristocratic family and the owners of Sweetlove House, an historic manor in the outskirts of Pagford, whose ancestors were responsible for selling the nearby city of Yarvil a piece of Pagford land — one of the catalysts for the plot.
