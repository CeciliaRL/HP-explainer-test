'''James Leigh Hamilton''' (b. [[17 November]], [[1982]]) was a professional rugby union player who played as a [[Wikipedia:Rugby union positions#Locks|lock]] for the [[Scottish rugby team]] since [[2006]].<ref name="Wikipedia">{{Wikilink|Jim Hamilton (rugby union)}}</ref> It is possible he was related to the wizarding [[Hagrid family]], given his strong physical resemblance to [[Rubeus Hagrid]].<ref name="Pottermore">{{PM}} - New from J.K. Rowling{{WW|scottish-rugby}}</ref>

In [[2014]], Jim Hamilton, along with [[Kelly Brown]] and [[Stuart Hogg]], came under suspect, among [[wizarding world|wizarding circles]], of actually being a talented [[Squib]]. While there is no wizarding rule which prevents a Squib from actually playing on a Muggle team, the act of smuggling a Squib into the team, which is the rumoured mission of the [[Wizarding Supporters of Scottish Rugby Union|WSSRU]], is in violation of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]] which prohibits wizards from participating in Muggle sports.<ref name="Pottermore"/>
