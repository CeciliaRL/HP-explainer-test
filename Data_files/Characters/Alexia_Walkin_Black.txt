'''Alexia Walkin Black'''<ref>On the Black family tapestry in the ''Order of the Phoenix'' film, only Blacks by birth have portraits, and only their given names are listed on the scrolls beneath the portraits. This indicates that this character was a Black and that Alexia Walkin was her given name.</ref> was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]]. She was an early member of the [[House of Black]], predating [[Arcturus Black I]] and [[Cygnus Black I]], but her precise relationship to other known members of the Black family is unknown. According to the [[Black Family Tapestry|Black family tree tapestry]], she never married nor had any children.<ref name="ootpmovie" />

==Etymology==
''Alexia'' is the feminine form of ''Alexis''. The [[Greece|Greek]] name Αλεξις (Alexis), which meant "helper" or "defender", is derived from Greek αλεξω (''alexo'') "to defend, to help". This was the name of a 3rd-century BC Greek comic poet, and also of several [[saint]]s. It is used somewhat interchangeably with the related name Αλεξιος or [[Wikipedia:Emperor Alexius|Alexius]], borne by five Byzantine emperors.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/alexis Alexis] on [http://www.behindthename.com/ Behind the Name].</ref>

Black can be considered a colour, and is the result of the absence of, or complete absorption of, light. In Western culture, the colour black has typically been associated with evil, darkness, and witchcraft, but also with prestige and sophistication — appropriate for the House of Black. Black has also been associated with life and prosperity by other cultures. In ancient [[China]], black was the symbol of the element of water, which also corresponds to Slytherin, the Hogwarts house of almost all members of the Black family. In English heraldry, black represents darkness and ignorance; a possible allusion to the prejudice common to members of the House of Black.

However, the English word ''black'' is derived from either the Old English ''blœc'', meaning "black", or ''blac'', meaning "pale". Pallor is associated with sickness and the colour white, which is usually held to symbolise purity in Western and [[India]]n culture, and death in East [[Asia]]n cultures. This mirrors the typical colouring of members of the House of Black — dark hair and pale skin.

==Behind the scenes==
*This character appears only on the version of the Black family tree shown in {{OOTP|FA}}. She was not included on the version of the tree which [[J. K. Rowling]] gave to a charity auction in [[2006]].<ref>"[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/blackfamilytree.html Black Family Tree]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> She was presumably created by the production team of the films, with her name being selected in honour of [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1023180/ Alexandra Walker], an art director on ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Goblet of Fire]]'', and ''Order of the Phoenix''.
*Based on a statement of [[Horace Slughorn]], Alexia Walkin probably graduated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin]] house. However, she attended Hogwarts in the 1820s, long before Slughorn was Potions teacher.
*Her siblings are probably [[Eduardus Limette Black|Eduardus Limette]], [[Phoebe Black|Phoebe]], [[Licorus Black|Licorus]] and [[Hesper Black]].
*On the scroll beneath Alexia's image on the family tree, there are no dates.
*It is possible that Walkin was a maiden name of Alexia’s mother.<ref>See [[Talk:Eduardus Limette Black]]. The maiden name is sometimes given as a middle name or even as a first name on occasion. Examples include [[Wikipedia:Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], [[Wikipedia:Richard Nixon|Richard Milhous Nixon]], [[Wikipedia:Ronald Wilson Reagan|Ronald Wilson Reagan]].</ref>
*Based on Black Family Tree Tapestry, Alexia’s and [[Andromeda Black|Andromeda&nbsp;Black]]’s pictures are the same.
