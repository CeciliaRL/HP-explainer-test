==Biography==
He was admitted to [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], in the [['Dangerous' Dai Llewellyn Ward: Serious Bites|'Dangerous' Dai Llewellyn Ward.]] [[Arthur Weasley]] was also a patient in St Mungo's at the time, having narrowly survived an [[Attack on Arthur Weasley|attack]] by [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s [[snake]], [[Nagini]]. Arthur's wife [[Molly Weasley|Molly]] was concerned about a werewolf being in a public ward, but Arthur reminded her during their visit that the full [[moon]] was still two weeks away at the time. The [[Healer]]s at St Mungo's spoke with the man, trying to persuade him that he would be able to live an almost normal life. For his part, Arthur spoke with the man and told him that he personally knew a werewolf who was a very decent individual and that they found the [[Lycanthropy|condition]] quite easy to manage. The man apparently grew annoyed with Arthur and angrily told him he would give him another bite if he did not stop talking.<ref name="OOTP22">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref>

When [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]], the [[Weasley family|Weasleys]], and a few members of the [[Order of the Phoenix|Order]] visited Arthur again on [[Christmas]], fellow werewolf [[Remus Lupin]] strolled over to the individual and spoke to him for a while, most likely to explain to him and/or console him over his new condition.<ref name="OOTP23">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref>
