==Etymology==
"Henry" is from the Germanic name ''Heimirich'', which means "home ruler", composed of the elements ''heim'', "home" and ''ric,'' "power", "ruler". It was later commonly spelled Heinrich, with the spelling altered due to the influence of other Germanic names, like Haganrich, in which the first element is ''hagan'', "enclosure".
