{{Quote|Theresa Stadt has somehow raised a Manticore – "Mr Whiskers" – from infancy. You are sent to recover the beast, which proves to be a remarkably ghastly affair. You increase the amount of damage you can withstand in combat.|Description|Harry Potter: Wizards Unite}}
'''Mr Whiskers''' was the name given to a male [[Manticore]] somehow raised from infancy by [[Theresa Stadt]], a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]].

When the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was notified of this Manticore, they sent a [[Magizoologist]] member of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] to retrieve it, which proved a "remarkably ghastly affair".<ref name="WU">{{WU}} (see [https://wizardsunitehub.info/profession-skill/pet-manticore/ this])</ref>
