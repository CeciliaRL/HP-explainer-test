'''Miraphorus''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] after whom the [[Miraphorus Magic Set]], a [[Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes]] product, was named. Every set included a replica pair of the distinctive red gloves she wore.<ref name="hpfilmwiz">{{HPFW}}, page 136 booklet {{see image|File:MiraphorusMagicSet2.jpg}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The name of this character is presumably a tribute to [[Miraphora Mina]], a graphic artist who has worked on every ''Harry Potter'' [[Harry Potter (film series)|film]], and who helped to design all the Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes props along with [[Eduardo Lima]], [[Nicholas Saunders]], and [[Lauren Wakefield]].
