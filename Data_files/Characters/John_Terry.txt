'''John Terry''' was a member of the [[England national football team]], captaining the team by [[July]] of [[1996]]. Around that time, John suffered a knee injury, missing his team's win against [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]]. This same injury re-emerged in training, causing his knee to lock up and him to be incapble of completing that session. For this reason, manager [[Steve McClaren]] chose to replace him with [[Sol Campbell]] for a match against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] later that season.<ref name="HPLEG">{{HPLE|G}} (see [[:File:TheGuardian.png|this image]])</ref> He is currently the captain of Chelsea Football Club.

==Behind the scenes==
*The listing of John Terry as captain of the England national team is anachronistic, as John Terry was still playing on Chelsea's youth team in 1996 in the real world. Indeed, John Terry would only have been fifteen at the time, too young to play for England's main team at all.
