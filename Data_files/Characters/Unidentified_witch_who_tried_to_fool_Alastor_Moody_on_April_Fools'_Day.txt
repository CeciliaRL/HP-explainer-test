This '''witch''' once tried to fool [[Alastor Moody]] on [[April Fools' Day]] by shouting "Boo" behind him. [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] (disguised as [[Alastor Moody]]) told this story to [[Seamus Finnigan]] in [[1994]], which [[Ronald Weasley]] implied that it did not end well.<ref name="GOF15">{{GOF|B|15}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*As this witch was only mentioned in a story that the fake Alastor Moody related to a student, there exists the possibility that there was no such individual and the fake Moody only created this story as part of his cover.
