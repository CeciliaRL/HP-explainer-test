'''Herpo the Foul''' was an [[Greece|Ancient Greek]] [[Dark Wizard]], infamous for being a pioneer in the field of the [[Dark Arts]], becoming the first known wizard to create the [[Basilisk]],<ref name="FBR"/> in addition to the first known [[Horcrux]].<ref name="Horcrux"/> A [[Parseltongue|Parselmouth]], he is one of the earliest known Dark Wizards and his work is still a lasting aspect of dark magic to date. For his depravity, he was featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="CFC" />

==Biography==
[[File:Herpo_The_Foul-11-chocFrogCard.png|thumb|left|150px|Herpo the Foul immortalised on a gold [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]
Born a [[Parselmouth]], Herpo had the ability to communicate with [[snake]]s. He spent his life studying the Dark Arts, [[Spell creation|inventing]] many vile [[curse]]s.<ref name="CFC">[[Chocolate Frog Card]]s</ref> At some point in his life, after much experimentation, he created the [[Herpo the Foul's basilisk|first known Basilisk]],<ref name="FBR">{{FB|R}}</ref> and being a [[Parselmouth]] he was able to communicate with and control it. In addition, he acquired a great understanding of the nature of the [[soul]], and how murder affected it. Armed with his knowledge and ruthlessness, he deliberately committed murder with the intention of splitting his soul, and subsequently sealed it inside an object [[Horcrux-making spell|with Dark Magic]], becoming the first known wizard to successfully create a [[Herpo the Foul's horcrux|Horcrux]].<ref name="Horcrux">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/1217-pottercast-anelli.html Anelli, Melissa, John Noe and Sue Upton.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Herpo was known as one of the most powerful and influential practitioners of dark magic in history, having immersed himself into dark magic of the most advanced and dangerous kind.<ref name="CFC"/> Herpo pioneered two of the darkest magical techniques known to wizardkind, being the first known wizard to successfully breed the [[Basilisk]],<ref name="FBR"/> and the first known wizard to have ever successfully created a [[Horcrux]], possibly inventing the process by which to do this. His Horcrux would have left his [[soul]] unstable, rendering him less than [[human]].<ref name="Horcrux"/> He was highly adept with [[curse]]s, having even [[Spell creation|invented]] many himself.<ref name="CFC"/>
*'''[[Immortality]]''': Being the first know wizard to have created a Horcrux, Herpo achieved immortality, with his soul being earthbound even if his body would be destroyed.<ref name="Horcrux"/>
*'''[[Spell creation]]''': He invented many vile [[curse]]s, which earned him his well-deserved malevolent reputation.<ref name="CFC"/>
*'''[[Parseltongue]]''': One of the earliest known Parselmouths, an uncommon gift to speak with [[snake]]s, which has been often connected to the Dark Arts.<ref name="FBR"/>
*'''[[Basilisk]] breeding''': First wizard to have discovered that hatching a [[Chicken (animal)|chicken]] [[egg]] under a toad will create the [[Basilisk|King of Serpents]]. He managed to control it with Parseltongue, thus initiating one of the few cases of a wizard "domesticating" a XXXXX-classified creature (known wizard-killer that cannot be tamed).<ref name="FBR"/>

==Possessions==
[[File:Herpo the Foul's Basilisk.png|150px|thumb|Herpo the Foul with his pet Basilisk]]
*'''[[Herpo the Foul's basilisk|Basilisk]]''': Herpo the Foul was notably the first wizard to breed a [[Basilisk]], an immensely powerful dark creature, which he owned as a pet. He was able to control the monster using Parseltongue, and was believed to have lived for at least 900 years.<ref name="FBR"/>
*'''[[Herpo the Foul's Horcrux|Horcrux]]''': Herpo was the first Dark Wizard in wizarding history to successfully create a [[Horcrux]], although it is unknown what kind of object he used to contain a piece of his fractured [[soul]] inside of.<ref name="Horcrux"/>

==Etymology==
*In Ancient Greek, ἑρπετόν (pronounced "herpeton") means "creeping animal". In modern times, [[Wikipedia:Herpetology|herpetology]] is the study of amphibians and reptiles. Basilisks are snakes, and thus reptiles, and Parseltongue is the language of snakes.
*In Ancient Greek, Herpo's name would be "Ἕρπων ὁ δεινός" (pronounced "Herpōn ho deinos"). This comes from the active participle of the verb ἕρπω, which is cognate with Latin ''serpo'', the active participle of which is ''serpens'' - the root of English "serpent."

==Behind the scenes==
*It is unknown when or under what circumstances Herpo the Foul died or his Horcrux was destroyed, assuming that these things did happen. If his Horcrux was never destroyed it is possible he is still alive in the series, possibly as a wandering soul (in a state that [[Horace Slughorn]] described as being worse than death).
*If Herpo did indeed die, it is unknown whether his [[soul]] had shared a [[Limbo|fate]] similar to that of [[Tom Riddle]] after the latter's death in 1998, assuming he never repented to repair his damaged soul.
*Herpo the Foul's depiction on his Chocolate Frog Card is somewhat snakelike, though not as much as [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s. This could be reference to Voldemort's decaying appearance in his later life, as he became progressively less human with the more murders he committed. As Herpo does not look as snakelike as Voldemort, he likely only made one Horcrux, as it has been stated that Riddle is the only known wizard to have made multiple Horcruxes.
*Ironically, he bred a creature whose venom could destroy his Horcrux.
*Herpo the Foul might have been a distant ancestor of [[Salazar Slytherin]], as Herpo was the earliest known [[Parseltongue|Parselmouth]], Slytherin was a Parselmouth himself, and the gift of Parseltongue is likely hereditary, as seen in the [[House of Gaunt|Gaunt]] descendants. Though it is unlikely that the Slytherin family was the only Parselmouth family in existence.
**Going on the above theory, if Herpo the Foul was indeed an ancestor of Slytherin, it is possible that the [[Serpent of Slytherin]] might actually have been [[Herpo the Foul's basilisk|Herpo's Basilisk]], as it is proven that Basilisks could live for hundreds, if not thousands of years.
