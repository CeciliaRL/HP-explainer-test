'''Snickerton''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] [[Snickerton's shop|tailor]] in [[London]] in the [[15th century]]. His rivalry with fellow dressmaker and [[Wizardkind|witch]] [[Delfina Crimp]] proved his downfall.<ref name="WBoS" />

==Biography==
Snickerton worked as a tailor in [[London]] in the [[15th century]]. Along with others of his profession, he was intensely jealous of the phenomenal success and popularity achieved by one particular London dressmaker, [[Delfina Crimp]], and began to suspect that she might be privy to secret knowledge which they were not.<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}}</ref>

Donning a disguise, Snickerton applied for a position in Madam Crimp's shop, and was successful. However, after several weeks, he had uncovered no evidence of [[magic]] except the lack of scissors in her workroom. Hoping to catch her using magic, Snickerton thus decided to hide out in her workroom one night, wrapping himself in a bolt of [[velvet]]. Sure enough, he witnessed her [[Severing Charm|using a wand to cut out an intricate pattern]], and the next day, he brought a group of men to arrest her on an accusation of witchcraft.<ref name="WBoS" />

Binding Madam Crimp's hands for fear she might [[curse]] them otherwise, Snickerton began searching her workshop for a [[wand]], which he swore he had seen her using the previous night. But after several hours of looking, he failed to turn up anything suspicious, and his friends began to doubt his account.<ref name="WBoS" />

Eventually, Madam Crimp asked to be untied so as to scratch her chin, to which the men agreed, seeing no danger. But the instant she touched a [[wart]] on her chin, it popped out of her face, revealing her wand. Quickly seizing a bag of [[gold]], she [[Apparition|disappeared]] from the scene, never to be seen in London again.<ref name="WBoS" />

However, from that day onward, Snickerton found it impossible to make a single item of clothing. Everything he created ended up shredded to bits in the morning regardless of how securely it was stored overnight. According to legend, he [[Death|died]] [[Insanity|insane]], believing that a giant pair of [[Invisibility|invisible]] scissors was following him everywhere he went.<ref name="WBoS" /> It is likely that Crimp cursed him as revenge, or followed him around and destroyed his clothes with her [[Severing Charm|charm]].
