This '''[[Wizardkind|witch]]''' worked at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] during the time of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s reign over the Ministry as part of the [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission]]'s many pamphlet-makers.<ref name="DH13"/>

==Biography==
She was described as being young, and she seemed to dislike [[Dolores Umbridge]] as she referred to her as an "old [[hag]]". She could possibly have been prejudiced towards [[Muggle-born]]s, as she referred to them as "[[Mudblood]]s", but as the term was so common during [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s reign at the Ministry it is possible she harboured no strong feelings about [[Muggle-born]]s and was simply throwing out the term casually. She was puzzled when [[Harry Potter]] (disguised as [[Albert Runcorn]]) used a [[Decoy Detonator]] to sneak into [[Senior Undersecretary to the Minister for Magic's office|Dolores Umbridge's Office]]. She later blamed it on [[Committee on Experimental Charms|Experimental Charms]], asking her colleague if he remembered the [[poisonous duck]].<ref name="DH13">{{DH|B|13}}</ref>
