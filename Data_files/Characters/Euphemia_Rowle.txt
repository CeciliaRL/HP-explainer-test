{{Dialogue a-b-a|Delphini|Wizards used to believe that the Augurey's cry foretold death.

'''Euphemia Rowle''' was a [[wizardkind|witch]] who raised [[Delphini]] following the end of the [[Second Wizarding War]]. According to Delphini, she did not care much for her ward, only taking her in for the [[gold]]. Rowle kept an [[augurey]] in a cage, and said that the creature kept crying because it could see Delphini was going to come to a "sticky end."<ref name="Act3Scene16">{{CC|B|3|16}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Delphini mentions Euphemia Rowle only took her in for the gold. While it is unclear who would pay Rowle to raise her, it may have been [[Rodolphus Lestrange]], Delphini's stepfather, who is known to have contacted her at least on one occasion.<ref name="Act4Scene11">{{CC|B|4|11}}</ref>
*Euphemia Rowle shares the same first name with [[Euphemia Potter]], Harry Potter's grandmother.
