'''Minister Harold Minchum''' was [[Minister for Magic]] between [[1975]] and [[1980]].

He was seen as a hard-liner, and placed even more [[Dementor]]s around [[Azkaban]]. But he was unable to contain what seemed like [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s unstoppable rise to power.<ref>{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The name "Harold Minchum" is a near-homophone of [[Wikipedia:Harold Wilson|Harold Wilson]], Prime Minister of the United Kingdom whose second term in office ([[1974]] to [[1976]]) would have coincided with that of Harold Minchum's.
