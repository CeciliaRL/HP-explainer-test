The '''two older brothers''' of [[Tertius]] (fl. [[16th century]]) were [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] brothers living somewhere in [[Scotland]].<ref name="WBP"/>

==Biography==
When their parents died, these two brothers chased Tertius out of their house and broke his [[wand]], afraid of him because he was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. Sometime afterwards, [[Zygmunt Budge]], who had heard this story from Tertius, sent these two Muggles a large bottle of [[Shrinking Solution]] by [[Owl Postal Service|owl post]], claiming it to be [[Butterbeer]]. This shrank them to the size of [[beetle]]s and, according to the story Budge heard, spend the next few days hiding under their cupboard from their [[cat]].<ref name="WBP">{{WBP}}</ref>
