'''Nerissa Brody''' was a [[Slytherin]]<ref name="house" /> student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]]. She competed in the school [[Exploding Snap]] tournament during the [[1996-1997 school year]].

==Etymology==
*The name "Nerissa" was created by Shakespeare for a character in his play ''The Merchant of Venice'' ([[1596]]). He possibly took it from Greek Νηρεις (''Nereis'') meaning "nymph, sea sprite", ultimately derived from the name of the Greek sea god ''Nereus'', who supposedly fathered them.
*The word "brody" is slang for intentionally spinning in circles and sliding in an automobile.
