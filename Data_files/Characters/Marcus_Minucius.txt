==Etymology==
In {{w|Roman naming conventions}}, "Marcus" was a common [[Latin]] ''{{w|praenomen}}''<ref name="Roman names"/> (personal name) used by the {{w|gens}} {{w|Minucia gens|Minucia}};<ref>{{wikilink|Minucia gens}}</ref> the name survived the Roman Empire and has continued to be used in modern-days, in various forms.<ref>{{wikilink|Marcus (praenomen)}}</ref><ref>{{wikilink|Marcus (name)}}</ref>

"Minucius" was the ''{{w|Nomen gentilicium|nomen}}''<ref name="Roman names"/> (designated name, signifying to be a member of a specific ''gens''<!-- "gens" is the singular form; plural "gentes"; do not wrongly removed the s -->) representing the gens Minucia.<ref>{{wikilink|Minucius}}</ref>
==Behind the scenes==
*Illustrator [[Jim Kay]] picked "Marcus Minucius" because of the {{w|Roman consul}} {{w|Marcus Minucius Rufus}} and his political enemy.<ref name="behind MMM"/>
**In the real-world, as Marcus was a popular ''praenomen'', historically, there are a number of individuals with names using the combination "Marcus Minucius", such as {{w|Marcus Minucius Felix}} and {{w|Marcus Minucius Augurinus}}, amongst others.
**In those cases, {{w|Minucius}} representing {{w|Minucia gens|gens Minucia}}, was an ancient [[Rome|Roman]] family.<ref name="Roman names">{{wikilink|Roman naming conventions}}</ref>
