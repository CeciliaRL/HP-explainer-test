{{Quote|My cousin had trouble with Avifors. He could only turn things into eggs. He was popular at breakfast time but he nearly failed the class.|The individual telling about her [[Boy who failed Avifors Spell|cousin]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
This '''individual''' (born c. [[1980]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]].<ref name="PSgba">{{PS|G}} - GBA version</ref>

==Biography==
{{Quote|Is it true that Snape constricts his meals in his snake-like coils before he eats them?|The girl on her first day at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}She started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1991-1992 school year]] and was [[sorting ceremony|Sorted]] to [[Slytherin]]. On the first day of term, [[2 September]] [[1992]], she seemed to have been let in on rumours that [[Severus Snape|Professor Snape]] behaved in a [[snake]]-like manner even in the way that he ate.<ref name="PSgba"/>

After the [[first year|first-years']] first [[Potions (class)|Potions]] class, she hung about the [[Dungeons]] talking with fellow [[Slytherin]]s about the upcoming [[Flying (class)|Flying]] lesson. She made fun of the [[Hufflepuff]]s by saying "''Don't walk under a flying Hufflepuff. They plummet''". She did not complete Snape's assignment of gathering all the ingredients for the [[Wiggenweld Potion]] (only [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]] and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] managed to procure [[Wiggentree bark]]) â€” at one point, she asked around "''Can you tell what [[dittany]] is by the smell?''".<ref name="PSgba"/>

{{Quote|I need a Remembrall like Neville's. Or maybe I'll just take his.|This girl|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
Shortly before the [[Hallowe'en feast]], she gave [[Neville Longbottom]] a grass-flavoured [[Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans|Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Bean]] and was telling about it to another [[Slytherin]] in the [[Entrance Hall]]. She seemed to bully Neville around: on a different occasion, she remarked that she needed a [[Remembrall]] and that perhaps she should take his.<ref name="PSgba"/>

{{Quote|Barely enough to mess my hair, Potter.|This student is hit by a spell|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
During [[Transfiguration (class)|Transfiguration]] class she told [[Harry Potter]] about [[Boy who failed Avifors Spell|her cousin]], who had not managed to perform the [[Avifors Spell]] correctly, as he seemed only to be able to turn objects into [[egg]]s: although he nearly failed the subject, he became popular at breakfast.<ref name="PSgba"/>

{{Quote|There are supposed to be lots of dangerous, horrible, gruesome spells in the Restricted Section. I can hardly wait until I get to go in!|This girl|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game)}}
Regarding the [[Third-floor corridor|Forbidden Corridor]], out-of-bounds to all students with no explanation, this student heard that [[goblin]]s had been commissioned to paint the walls and that they did not like to be watched as it made them streak. She also wondered what kinds of books were in the [[Restricted Section]], expressing a desire to go there.<ref name="PSgba"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*This student is clearly a [[first year|first-year]] from her dialogue and presence in first-year classes. In spite of this fact, there are multiple [[Prefect]]s during night-time sneak missions that bear her likeness.
