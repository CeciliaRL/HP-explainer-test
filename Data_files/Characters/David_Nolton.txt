'''David Nolton''' was a [[Gryffindor]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]].

==Biography==

==Etymology==
The name "David" comes from the Hebrew name דָּוִד (Dawid), which was probably derived from Hebrew דוד (dwd) meaning "beloved". King David was the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel according to the Hebrew Bible.
