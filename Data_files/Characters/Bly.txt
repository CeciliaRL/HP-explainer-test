==Biography==
{{Dialogue a-b-a-b-a-b|Lottie Turner|Who are you?|Bly|You may recognise me by my other form, by that [[Jakub Gorski|old fool]]'s side.|Bly? You're an Animagus...|I had to follow that doddering wizard for so long. At first it was a hunt like all the others, but when I realised what we were hunting... I couldn't let him have it!|You were [[Imperius Curse|controlling]] Professor Gorski?|Yes! He lost his mettle. He wasn't willing to do what had to be done to find the artefact.|Bly revealing himself to Lottie Turner|Harry Potter: Magic Awakened}}
During his life, Bly searched for a treasured artefact which turned out to be the [[Turner family]]'s heirloom and murdered [[Lottie Turner]]'s [[Lottie Turner's father|father]] for it.<ref name="MA"/>

Bly put the [[Imperius Curse]] on [[Jakub Gorski]], the visiting [[History of Magic]] [[Professor]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and [[Human Transfiguration|transformed]] into his [[lemur]] [[Animagus]] form to disguise as Gorski's animal assistant. At one point, he came down to the [[Chamber of Secrets]] in his human form, likely in search of [[Basil Aurelius III]]'s portrait, and when Basil alerted him to a group of students who were talking to Basil at the time, Bly animated a snake statue in the chamber to attack the students before fleeing. He also accompanied Gorski in his Animagus form when he came to the students to check out their progress of the assignment on various occasions.<ref name="MA"/>

Once in his Animagus form in the [[History of Magic Classroom]], he controlled Gorski to say "I'm always watching" and [[Charm|bewitch]] [[Suit of armour|suits of armour]] to attack the students, who was confronting Gorski about his suspicious activities. He then left, still in his Animagus form but with a [[wand]] in his hand, which befuddled the students.<ref name="MA"/>

When the students, including Lottie Turner, led the way to the heirloom, Bly showed up in his human form and dragged Lottie through the final barrier, a magical mirror, and forced her to open the heirloom's container. Her friends met up with them and had a fight with Bly, who was defeated.<ref name="MA"/>
