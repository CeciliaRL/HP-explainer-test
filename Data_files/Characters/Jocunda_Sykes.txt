==Behind the scenes==
*Jocunda is possibly the wizard counterpart of [[Wikipedia:Amelia Earhart|Amelia Earhart]], who is famous for flying across the Atlantic on a plane, the first woman to do so.
*In the Danish version of the second game her name is misspelt "Jocunca Sykes".
*The etymology of her first name, from the Latin for "congenial" or "delightful", is the source of the English ''jocund, ''generally suggesting a cheerful and carefree approach to life. Also, her last name is an anagram for "skies", though the "i" has been replaced by a "y" in order to make it look more like a well-respected name.
