==Biography==
{{Quote|Oh, so you’re gonna STEAL the money, huh?|Mr Bingley accusing Jacob Kowalski of bank robbery|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
On [[6 December]] [[1926]], Bingley conducted an in-person review of [[Jacob Kowalski]]'s application for a loan to open [[Kowalski Quality Baked Goods|a bakery]].<ref name="FB9" /><ref name="FB11">{{FB|S|11}}</ref> He summarily rejected the application when it became clear that Kowalski had insufficient income or assets to offer collateral.<ref name="FB11" />

Shortly thereafter, Bingley wandered down to the basement of the bank and found Jacob standing in front of an opened vault, in which [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] was trying to recapture his escaped [[Niffler]].<ref name="FB15">{{FB|S|15}}</ref> Thinking that Jacob was trying to steal the money he needed, Bingley activated the alarm, but was swiftly paralysed with the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] by Newt, allowing the [[wizardkind|wizard]] and his unlikely [[No-Maj]] companion to escape.<ref name="FB15" />

Two days later, [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] had [[Frank]] the [[Thunderbird]] disperse [[Swooping Evil|swooping evil]] [[Swooping Evil venom|venom]] over [[New York]] by creating a [[Water|rainstorm]], in order to erase the memories of a [[Obscurial|recent magical catastrophe]] from the minds of the city's No-Maj population.<ref name="FB118">{{FB|S|118}}</ref> At the time, Bingley was taking a shower in the bathroom while [[Bingley's wife|his wife]] brushed her teeth at the sink, the [[water]] erasing his memories as it washed over him.<ref name="FB118" />

He likely took a sudden retirement due to the strange activities he experienced at his bank.<ref name="FBF">{{FB|F}} {{see image|File:New York Clarion - 7 Dec - altered cover - FBF.png}}</ref>
