==Behind the scenes==
*James only appeared on a piece of concept artwork for {{POA|FA}}, that can be seen in the book {{HPV|CH}}.
*The name "James" can be read on this individual's [[Quidditch]] robes, meaning that this is the character's surname, seeing as other uniform concept arts and those seen in the actual films feature surnames only (e.g. "Potter" and "Zabini").
