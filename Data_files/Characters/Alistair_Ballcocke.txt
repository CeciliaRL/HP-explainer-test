'''Alistair Ballcocke''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] whose name was carved into a wood panel on the wall of Professor [[Sybill Trelawney|Trelawney's]] [[Divination (class)|Divination]] [[Divination Classroom|classroom]].<ref>{{POA|F}} - Chapter 21 (''Professor Trelawney's Prediction'') {{see image|File:Alistair Ballcocke.jpg}}</ref><ref>[http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2004/5/15/los-angeles-motion-picture-arts-sciences-contemporary-set-exhibit-report ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' set report] from the Leaky Cauldron</ref>

==Etymology==
''Ballcocke'' is an alternate spelling of the English surname ''Balcock'', which derives from the diminutive suffix -''cock'' combined with either ''Bald'', a pet form of the Germanic male given name ''Baldwin'', or the Old English ''beald'' ("brave," "bold").<ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=DDF3mn8473wC&pg=PA161 ''A Dictionary of English Surnames''] by P. H. Reaney and R. M. Wilson</ref>

A ballcock is a mechanism for filling water tanks (such as in flush toilets) designed to prevent overflow and backflow.<ref>"[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballcock Ballcock]" on Wikipedia</ref>

Alistair is the anglicised form of Alasdair. Alasdair is the Scottish form of Alexander, which means "defending men".

==Behind the scenes==
*This character was presumably named after [[Alastair Bullock]], the assistant art director on {{POA|FA}}.
