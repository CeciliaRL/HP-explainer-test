This '''individual''' (fl. [[1492]]) was a priest and the man who comforted [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington|Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] just before his execution on the dawn of [[1492]]. Upon denying Sir Nicholas of wearing a hat (extravagant plumed hats were somewhat of a passion of his), the [[wizardkind|wizard]] knew his end was nigh.<ref name="background">[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=11 Extra Stuff - "Nearly Headless Nick"] on [[J. K. Rowling's official site]]</ref>
