This '''individual''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] woman. In [[1992]], she married [[Nigel]], a [[wizardkind|wizard]], which made [[Nigel's nephew's father|her husband's brother or brother-in-law]] furious, as he was presumably [[Pure-blood supremacy|prejudiced against Muggles]]. [[Nigel's nephew|Her nephew]], however, was not upset at all, as this Muggle woman bought him sweets.<ref>{{COS|G}} - PC version</ref>
