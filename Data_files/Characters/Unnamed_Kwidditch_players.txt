There were '''unnamed Kwidditch players''', probably living on the edge of [[Queerditch Marsh]] in [[Manchester]], [[England]]<ref name="jkr-manchester" /> in the [[11th century]]. They were playing [[Quidditch|Kwidditch]], and their game took place over the marsh, between two trees, serving as a primitive form of modern [[Goalpost|goal posts]], and was recorded by [[Gertie Keddle]] in her [[Gertie Keddle's diary|diary]]. Each of them had his own flying [[broomstick]]. Their leather ball (an early equivalent of today's [[Quaffle]]) accidentally fell into Keddle's bowl of cabbage and through her window. She was so angry she hexed one of the players, who flew for it.<ref>{{QTA|R|3}}</ref> These people are the first documented [[Wizardkind|wizards]] to play the oldest form of contemporary broomstick game called [[Quidditch]].
