'''Elveira Elkins''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who wrote to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'s'' advice column. She could not get a simple [[Fixing Charm]] to last. [[Zamira Gulch]] told her that this was due to her failure to concentrate while casting the spell and recommended that she rely on nails instead.<ref>[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[1 June]], [[1999]], Problem Page</ref>
