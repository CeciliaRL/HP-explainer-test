'''Eliza '''was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was a member of [[Ravenclaw]] [[Hogwarts Houses|House]].  

==Biography==
Eliza was born somewhere in [[Great Britain]] or [[Ireland]] during the early [[1970s]]. She began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1985–1986 school year]], where she was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Ravenclaw]]. 

Eliza was revising for her [[Potions (class)|Potions]] exam late one night in the [[Ravenclaw Common Room]], and the next day she could not find her notes. She thought another pupil might have used the [[Severing Charm]] on her bag, which made them fall out. Eliza then searched the common room for the notes, which she eventually found.

==Behind the scenes==
*The search for Eliza's notes was a specific assignment for Ravenclaw only players in {{HM}}. In the game, [[Rowan Khanna]] tells [[Jacob's sibling]] why Eliza needs their help and they agree to search the room with her. Eliza was very grateful for their help and went to tell [[Filius Flitwick|Professor Flitwick]] about their kindness towards [[first year]] Ravenclaws.<ref>{{HM|2|Take Note}} {{c|info revealed to [[Ravenclaw]] players}}</ref>
