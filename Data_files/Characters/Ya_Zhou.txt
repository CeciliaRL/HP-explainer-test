==Biography==
{{Quote|You know which of your creatures was responsible, Mr Scamander?|Ya asking Newt about what killed Senator Shaw|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
On [[6 December]] [[1926]], she met in [[New York]] to discuss the magical disturbances in [[New York]], including the death of [[Muggle|No-Maj]] Senator [[Henry Shaw Junior]].<ref name="FBS22"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Ya Zhou was portrayed by [[Gemma Chan]] in ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''.<ref>{{IMDb name|nm2110418|Gemma Chan}}</ref>
*Based on her name, Ya Zhou was most likely from [[China]] and as such may have worked for the [[Chinese Ministry of Magic]].
*If "Ya" is indeed her surname, not "Zhou", then the name's pronunciation is the same as the word "Asia" in Chinese. In fact, the simplified Chinese translation of {{FB|S}} translates the name to "亚洲", which means Asia. But since "亚" is a very uncommon surname, the surname could be "周" ("Zhou") instead.
