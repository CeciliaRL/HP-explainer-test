'''Wee Willykins''' was a character in [[Beatrix Bloxam]]'s heavily-reworked version of the [[Beedle the Bard]] tale ''[[The Wizard and the Hopping Pot]]''. In the story, Wee Willykins cured his dolls' stomachaches after initially being "an old grumpy-wumpkins" and refusing to do so, causing the golden hopping pot to dance delightedly on "its tiny rosy toes" and fill with sweets for Wee Willykins and the dolls.<ref>{{TBB|E}} - ''Albus Dumbledore on "''The Wizard and the Hopping Pot''".''</ref>
