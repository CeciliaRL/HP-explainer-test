{{Quote|What is history? This is history. To [[Cassandra Vole|you]], this might be a boring old rock, but to me, it's part of the delicate tapestry of events that saved Hogwarts. Let me tell you where this rock has been!|Professor Gorski introducing his subject to students|Harry Potter: Magic Awakened}}

==Biography==
{{Quote|History is everywhere. You just need to know how to find it. I've been all over the world, from the highest mountains to the deepest seas, looking for treasure... Ummm... I mean history... wherever I can find it. I'm your visiting Professor Jakub Gorski.|Professor Gorski to his students regarding his travels and love of history|Harry Potter: Magic Awakened}}
Before the [[2009–2010 school year]] at Hogwarts, the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Bly]], in search of the [[Turner family]]'s heirloom, bewitched Gorski with the [[Imperius Curse]], and then [[Human Transfiguration|transformed]] into his [[lemur]] [[Animagus]] form, disgusing himself as Gorski's animal assistant.<ref name="MA"/>

Professor Gorski began his first lesson with [[Second year|second-year]] students with a short speech and introduced himself to them. He talked about historical artefacts and assigned the students the homework of identifying a rare object or uncovering a mystery. Throughout the school year, possibly under the instruction of Bly, he met a group of students (including [[Lottie Turner]]) several times in the castle and checked out their progress of the assignment. He also visited the [[Hog's Head Inn]] in [[Hogsmeade]] and traded with a [[Dark Wizard]], which was noticed by the students.<ref name="MA" />

Gorski was later confronted by the students in the [[History of Magic Classroom]] and acted very suspiciously. He tried to explain but couldn't give up Bly's name, and [[Charm|enchanted]] the [[Suit of armour|suits of armour]] in the classroom to attack the students under Bly's control. When Bly fled, Gorski fell down to the floor. [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] soon came and instructed the students to return to the dormitories, before which Gorski gave them a warning not to let Bly find the artefact first.<ref name="MA" />

After Bly was defeated by the students, Gorski handed Lottie a [[portrait]] of [[Lottie Turner's father|her father]] inside the container of the family heirloom, allowing the father and daughter to reunite.<ref name="MA" />
