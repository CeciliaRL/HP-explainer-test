'''Romilda Goshawk''' (fl. [[1921]]) was one of [[Miranda Goshawk]]'s eight older sisters.<ref name="WBoS"/>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Romilda grew up in a [[Goshawk family|wizarding family]] with eight sisters, including [[Diadema Goshawk|Diadema]], [[Tangwystl Goshawk|Tangwystl]], and the youngest, [[Miranda Goshawk|Miranda]].<ref name="WBoS"/>

Along with the other seven older sisters, Romilda used to try to give Miranda the wrong [[incantation]] for every [[spell]] she attempted to cast, thus hindering her learning of [[magic]]. Miranda found learning spells complex enough as it was, given that the instructions that she found in the old-fashioned textbooks she was given during her school years were needlessly complicated.<ref name="WBoS"/>

Miranda kept Romilda out of her room when she wanted some peace by casting the [[Bat-Bogey Hex]] on her.<ref name="WBoS"/>

===Later life===
[[File:Goshtail.png|250px|thumb|left|Romilda's tail]]
As a result of the difficulty she experienced learning spells as a child, when she grew up, Miranda became quite an accomplished spellbook author, wishing to make teaching and learning about spells an easier task. When she released ''[[Book of Spells]]'', Miranda had a few "special editions" (actually editions containing deliberate misprints) sent to her sisters, and as a result, Romilda was left with a [[Tail-growing spell|tail]] that eventually vanished.<ref name="WBoS"/>
