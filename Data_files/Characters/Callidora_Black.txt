'''Callidora Longbottom''' (née '''Black''') (b. [[1915]]) was a [[pure-blood]] witch, the eldest daughter of [[Arcturus Black II]] and [[Lysandra Yaxley]] and sister of [[Charis Black|Charis]] and [[Cedrella Black|Cedrella]]. She married [[Harfang Longbottom]], and the couple had two children, a [[Harfang Longbottom's son|son]] and [[Harfang Longbottom's daughter|a daughter]].<ref name="BFT"/> She is related to the [[Crouch family|Crouch]] and [[Weasley family|Weasley]] families through her sisters, and may be related to [[Frank Longbottom's father|Mr Longbottom]] and his [[Frank Longbottom|son]] and [[Neville Longbottom|grandson]].

==Etymology==
*''Callidora'' means "gift of beauty" in Greek.<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/submit/view.php?name=callidora Behind the Name: Callidora]</ref> It is also the name of a [[Wikipedia:Setiostoma callidora|species of sedge moths]].

==Behind the scenes==
*Callidora's sister [[Cedrella Black|Cedrella]] was disowned by their [[House of Black|family]] for marrying [[Septimus Weasley]], a "[[blood traitor]]". Given that Callidora was not burned off the [[House of Black|Black family tree]] tapestry for her marriage, this suggests that the [[Longbottom family|Longbottoms]] are considered to be a more "respectable" pure-blood family than [[Weasley family|Weasleys]]. Interestingly, the [[Longbottom family]] would be seen as "blood traitors" now because they opposed [[Voldemort]]'s reign and the notion of blood purity. 
*Since Callidora and [[Cassiopeia Black|Cassiopeia]] were born in the same year, it is most likely that they were classmates at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].
*Callidora's and Elladora's pictures on the family tree in the film are the same.
*Callidora was not featured on the Longbottom family tree shown on Pottermore.
*As Callidora and her sisters Cedrella and Charis were born between [[1915]] and [[1919]], they would have been three of the many first ever Slytherins [[Horace Slughorn]] taught when he became Potions teacher in 1931.
