{{Quote|Flamboyant American vampire. Author of ''[[A Vampire's Monologue]]'' — intended to bore the reader into a stupor making him/her easier prey for vampires.|[[Chocolate Frog Card]]|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game)}}
'''Amarillo Lestoat''' ([[1776]]—[[1977]]) was a flamboyant [[United States of America|American]] [[vampire]]. He wrote a book, ''[[A Vampire's Monologue]]'', which was intended to bore readers out of their minds and render them easier to bite. For his infamy, he was immortalised onto a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"''Amarillo''" is [[Spain|Spanish]] for "''yellow''", "''le''" is [[France|French]] for "''the''" and a [[wikipedia:Stoat|stoat]] is an animal related to the weasel. Consequently, his name appears to translate to "''the yellow stoat''".

==Behind the scenes==
*His surname and overall character might be based on the character [[w:c:vampirechronicles:Lestat_de_Lioncourt|Lestat de Lioncourt]], a vampire in Anne Rice's ''[[w:c:vampirechronicles:The_Vampire_Chronicles|The Vampire Chronicles]]'', who has a similar appearance and lived within the same time frame.
