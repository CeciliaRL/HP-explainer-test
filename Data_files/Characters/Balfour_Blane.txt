'''Balfour Blane''' ([[1566]] – [[1629]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who established the [[Committee on Experimental Charms]]. For this accomplishment, he was commemorated on a bronze [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Given that {{PM}} revealed that the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was formally established in [[1707]]<ref name="PMministers">{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref> (78 years after Balfour Blane's death), it follows that the Committee on Experimental Charms must predate the Ministry itself, possibly having started out as part of the [[Wizards' Council]].

==Etymology==
The name "Balfour" is from a Scottish surname, originally from various place names, which meant "village pasture" in Gaelic.
