This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who lived in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]]. He later got married to [[Boy who owned a magic hamster's mother|a witch]] and in c. [[1980]] he had [[Boy who owned a magic hamster|a son]]. They were presumably very poor as they saved on the [[Electricity|light bill]] by using the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]], ''Lumos'', to save [[Galleon]]s to be able to afford their son's trip to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref>
