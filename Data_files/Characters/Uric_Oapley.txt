In the painting, Oapley is depicted as playing a game of [[Wizard's Chess]] with [[Podric Piles]], with [[Tobias Stump]], standing, watching over the game, and [[Muldoon Cragg]], in the background, absorbed in reading. Oapley is depicted as sitting on a chair, wearing a curly white powdered wig with a black pointy hat, a red coat and matching breeches, white cravat and stockings, and holding a roll of parchment on his left hand with what seems to be a depiction of the [[Wikipedia:Tree of Jesse|Tree of Jesse]].
