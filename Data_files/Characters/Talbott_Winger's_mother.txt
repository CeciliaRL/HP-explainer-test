'''Talbott Winger's mother''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who opposed [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[First Wizarding War]], though neither she nor [[Talbott Winger's father|Talbott's father]] joined any defence organisation.

==Biography==
At some point in her life, she trained to become [[Healer]], and worked as one at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], a [[Wizardkind|wizarding]] hospital in [[London]]. She was also an [[Animagus]], and in preparation for an attack, taught her son how to become one.<ref name="HM3A"/>

She grew [[pumpkin]]s in her garden.<ref name="garden date">{{HM}}, Garden Date with Talbott</ref>

She and her husband were vehemently opposed to the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Death Eaters]]' reign of terror across [[Great Britain]], although she and her husband, for some reason, did not join the [[Order of the Phoenix]]. One day, she and Talbott's father were murdered by [[Death Eaters]], though their son managed to escape, due to Animagus ability to transform into an [[Eagle]] at will, allowing him to fly away to safety.<ref name="HM3A">{{HM|3|Become an Animagus|3}} {{c|info only revealed should the player choose to participate this time-limited Side Quest, and reach a specific stage before the task ended.}}</ref>

In the [[1986–1987 school year]], [[Barnaby Lee]] made up the claim that Talbott's mother was a [[Mermaid]].<ref name="HM3A1">{{HM|3|Become an Animagus|1}}</ref>

==Personality and traits==
She was evidently a mothering and kind soul, as shown by her work as a [[Healer]], and by nurturing upbringing of her son. She evidently [[love]]d and cared about her son Talbott immensely and his welfare, as she taught her son to become an Animagus, in order to help him escape danger should he have needed to, an ability which saved her son's life. She was also clearly a very powerful and accomplished witch in her own right, as shown by her career path and her very remarkable ability to have become an Animagus.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': As a professional [[Healer]] employed at [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]], she would have been an expert in the art of medical [[magic]], including with [[healing spell]]s, healing potions and other magical remedies.

*'''[[Herbology]]''': As part of her job, she believed in using fresh herbal ingredients for healing, so she kept a garden in her home of magical and mundane plants.
