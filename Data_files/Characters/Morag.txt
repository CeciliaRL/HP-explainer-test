'''Morag''' (c. [[1981]]) was a [[wizardkind|witch]] and a [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] student in her youth. She was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into either [[Ravenclaw]], [[Slytherin]] or [[Hufflepuff]] on [[1 September]], [[1992]].<ref name="CSpc">{{COS|G}} - PC version</ref>

Sometime in late [[1992]], during a [[Transfiguration]] class about [[Match to needle spell|Transfiguring a matchstick]] Morag tried to [[Fire-Making Spell|light]] hers, and was scolded for it by [[Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]].<ref name="CSpc"/>

==Behind the scenes==
