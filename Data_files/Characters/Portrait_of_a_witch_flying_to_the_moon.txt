This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] whose portrait hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] in the [[1990s]], on the seventh-floor level of the [[Grand Staircase]], next to a [[Portrait of wailing women|portrait of wailing Egyptians]] and the [[Staring Portrait]]. She was depicted in black robes, and seemed to have befriended a [[portrait of a man on a flying carpet]].<ref name="PA13">{{POA|F}} - Chapter 13 (''Flight of the Fat Lady'')</ref>
