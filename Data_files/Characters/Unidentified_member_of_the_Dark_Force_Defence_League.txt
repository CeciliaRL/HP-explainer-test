{{Quote|Personally, I would be highly suspicious of anybody who could [[Parseltongue|converse]] with [[snake]]s, as serpents are often used in the worst kinds of [[Dark Magic]], and are historically associated with evil-doers...anyone who seeks out the company of such vicious creatures as [[Remus Lupin|werewolves]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid|giants]] would appear to have a fondness for violence.|This member's scathing criticism of [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and a member of the [[Dark Force Defence League]].<ref name="GOF31">{{GOF|B|31}}</ref>

==Biography==
In [[1995]], he was anonymously quoted by ''[[The Daily Prophet]]'' in [[Rita Skeeter]]'s article ''[[HARRY POTTER "DISTURBED AND DANGEROUS"]]''. Therein, he criticised [[Harry Potter]] for his ability to speak [[Parseltongue]], suggesting that he may be a [[Dark Wizard|dark wizard]] because of it. Likewise, he also commented on Potter's relationships with [[Remus Lupin]] and [[Rubeus Hagrid]], whom he likened to violent, "vicious creatures" for their statuses as a [[werewolf]] and [[half-giant]] respectively.<ref name="GOF31"/>

==Personality and traits==
He seemed to be extremely prejudiced towards "[[half-breed]]s" and [[Harry Potter]] for unexplained reasons, referring to them both slanderously in an obvious attempt to discredit them,<ref name="GOF31"/> although it is possible that his words were fabricated or mistranslated by the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'', a newspaper not known for its journalisitc honesty.
