==Biography==
During the first match of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]] against the [[Ivorian National Quidditch team|Ivory Coast]], Lundekvam twice suffered [[jinx]]es cast at him from members of the crowd, leading the match to be halted while security wizards located the culprits.<ref name="PM">{{PM}} - [[NORWAY VERSUS IVORY COAST]] (Archived)</ref> These unprovoked attacks were presumably due to the crowd's distaste at the Norwegian team, as their mascot, a [[Selma]], had instigated a fight against the [[Fiji]]an [[Dukuwaqa]] that escalated into a chaotic riot amongst the mascots that left three hundred wizards injured.<ref name="PM2">{{PM}} - [[DISASTROUS OPENING CEREMONY LEADS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP SECURITY]] (Archived)</ref>
