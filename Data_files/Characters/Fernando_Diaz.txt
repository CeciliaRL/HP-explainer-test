'''Fernando Diaz''' was a [[Brazil]]ian [[wizardkind|wizard]] and a [[Chaser]] for the [[2014]] [[Brazilian National Quidditch team]]. He, along with fellow Chaser [[Alejandra Alonso]], was described as one of [[Brazil]]'s finest by [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]] for her article in the [[Daily Prophet]] on the [[American National Quidditch team|USA]]-Brazil game.<ref name="PM">[http://insider.pottermore.com/2014/05/read-ginny-potters-match-reports-from.html "Read Ginny Potter's match reports from the 2014 Quidditch World Cup every day this week"] at [http://insider.pottermore.com {{PM}} Insider]</ref>

==Biography==
During the [[BRAZIL VERSUS HAITI|Brazil vs Haiti]] match, him and his fellow Brazil Chasers, [[Alejandra Alonso]] and [[Gonçalo Flores]], made as many as thirty attempts to score during the beginning of the game, although they only made ten goals. [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Potter]] also commended all three Brazilian Chasers for keeping their heads during the [[BRAZIL VERSUS WALES|Brazil vs Wales]] match that was deemed the most contentious match of the tournament.<ref name="PM"/>

In the semifinal match between Brazil and the [[United States of America]], Diaz and Alonso both dropped the [[Quaffle]] twice, something that was common in that match due to the nerves associated with the possibility of Brazil's reaching the World Cup final for the first time since [[1982]].<ref name="PM"/>
