{{Quote|Bartemius! Not trying to lure [[Harry Potter|Potter]] into one of the Ministry's summer internships, are we? The last boy who went into the Department of Mysteries never came out!|[[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] (impersonating [[Alastor Moody]]) to [[Bartemius Crouch Senior|Barty Crouch Snr]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)}}
This '''boy''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and summer intern at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] sometime before early [[1995]] and worked in the [[Department of Mysteries]]. He went missing within the Department and was never found.<ref name="GOFF">{{GOF|F}} - Chapter 23 (''Barty Crouch's death'')</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This is possible that he fell into [[veil]] in [[Death Chamber]] and thus [[Death|died]], which could explain his strange disappearance.
*It is unclear why the Ministry of Magic would allow summer interns to work in a highly classified department. Perhaps this statement might not be true at all and was only spoken by [[Bartemius Crouch Junior]] to try and insult his father.
