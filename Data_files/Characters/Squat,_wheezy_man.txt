{{Quote|The Order's got one thing right, then, eh?|This Death Eater regarding the Death Eater's [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|infiltration of the Ministry]]|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
This '''individual''' was a [[Dark Wizard]] and [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]], who served as one of Lord Voldemort's servants during the [[Second Wizarding War]].<ref name="DH1"/>

==Biography==
[[File:Death Eaters seated at Malfoy Manor.jpg|180px|left|The Man with other fellow Death Eaters in a meeting]]
He was present during the meeting at [[Malfoy Manor]] sitting between [[Draco Malfoy]] and [[Corban Yaxley]], where he made derisive comments about the [[Order of the Phoenix]]'s intelligence, provoking malicious laughter from all present.<ref name="DH1">{{DH|B|1}}</ref>

This man was one of the Death Eaters who [[Attack at the Burrow|invaded the Burrow]] and attacked the guests of the [[Wedding of William Weasley and Fleur Delacour|wedding]] of [[William Weasley|Bill Weasley]] and [[Fleur Delacour]].<ref name="DHF1">{{DH|F1}}</ref>
[[File:HPDH2-0239.jpg|100px|thumb|The Death Eater talking with Hermione disguised as Bellatrix]]
Later, he met [[Hermione Granger]] in [[Diagon Alley]] and said "Madam Lestrange" with a nod, since Hermione had taken [[Polyjuice Potion]] to look like [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] in order to enter the [[Lestrange Vault]] and he did not know she was an impostor, though he did seem somewhat confused by her polite response. He was among the Death Eaters in the [[Forbidden Forest]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] who watched as [[Harry Potter]] turned himself over to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]. He was later seen when Voldemort brought Harry's supposedly dead body back to Hogwarts and took part in the final battle where he was defeated by [[Minerva McGonagall]].<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref> He was possibly killed or imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] after the battle.<ref name="DH36">{{DH|B|36}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
He was described as squat, meaning he was short and chubby. He had a wheezy laugh and no hair on his head besides a beard and moustache.<ref name="DH1"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*This Death Eater is portrayed by [[Graham Duff]].
*In Behind the Scenes of the film {{DH|F2}}, this Death Eater seems to be shot with the [[Full Body-Bind Curse]] cast by [[Minerva McGonagall]] and falls forwards close to where [[Molly Weasley]] is fighting. Although it is from a behind the scenes clip, it could possibly be a part of the Deleted Scenes, Exclusive Scenes or Behind the Scenes.
*Although in the book he is described as squat, in the film he is almost completely opposite: tall and chubby. In fact, he is one of the tallest [[Death Eaters]].
*In a behind the scenes clip, this man is seen [[Apparition|disapparating]] alongside several others as the [[Malfoy family]] leaves. He leaves as Bellatrix begins to scream, however, he is still fighting until he is [[jinx]]ed seconds before Bellatrix's final fight.
