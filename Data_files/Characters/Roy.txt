'''Roy''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Slytherin]] student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts School]] during the [[1990s]].

==Biography==
In [[1992]], he became a member of the [[Duelling Club]] and was ranked seventh on the club's top-ten [[Duelling|duellists]] list.<ref>{{COS|G}} - PC version</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Roy" is the anglicised form of Ruadh. A notable bearer was the Scottish outlaw and folk hero Rob Roy (1671-1734). It is often associated with French roi "king".

Roy is also the pet form of Roibeard (the Gaelic form of [[Robert (disambiguation)|Robert]]), the short form of Royal (meaning "king" or "kingly") or the Anglicised version of the name Ruadh (meaning "red") [http://www.20000-names.com/male_r_names_3.htm] [http://webspace.webring.com/people/ge/edgarbook/names/frames.html]. It is also possible that Roy is a shortened form of another name in the Potter universe such as Royden (see [[Royden Poke]]) or Royston (see [[Royston Idlewind]]).
