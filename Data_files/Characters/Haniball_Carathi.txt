'''Haniball Carathi''' was an artist who worked in an unknown period. One of his known works was a "little piece" of "our Ladie" (i.e., [[Mary]]) with the presumably infant [[Jesus]] "upon her right hand." A catalogue listing for this work was incorporated into the label of the [[Belch Powder]] box.<ref>''Label Collection'' book in the {{HPWC}} box set {{see image|File:BelchPowder.jpg}}.</ref>
