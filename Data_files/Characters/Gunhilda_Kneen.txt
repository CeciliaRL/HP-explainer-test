Prior to a match against a nearby team from Ilkley, Gunhilda contracted a touch of [[Dragon Pox]], and was unable to play, forcing the team to use [[Radulf]]. After the victory, Goodwin got drunk at the local inn, and Gunhilda was not best pleased - she [[Finger-removing jinx|jinxed]] him, causing him to lose his fingers temporarily.<ref name="QTA3">{{QTA|R|3}}</ref>
