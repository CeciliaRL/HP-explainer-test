'''Minister Hortensia Milliphutt''' was a [[wizardkind|witch]] who, from [[1841]] to [[1849]], served as [[Minister for Magic]] of [[British Ministry of Magic|Britain]] and [[Ireland]], being elected at least twice but defeated for re election in 1849.

==Biography==
She had the distinction of being the Minister who introduced the most legislation during her term in office. Much of this new legislation was useful, but her political downfall came when she started passing regulations on hat pointiness and other wearisome laws.<ref>{{WW|ministers-for-magic}}</ref>
