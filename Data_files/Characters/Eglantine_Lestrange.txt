'''Eglantine Lestrange '''was a French [[wizardkind|witch]] and a member of the [[pure-blood]] [[Lestrange family]]. She was the daughter of [[Falco Lestrange]] and [[Salomé Lestrange]]. She married her cousin<ref name="family tree"/> [[Corvus Lestrange (III)|Corvus Lestrange]] and had a son with him, [[Corvus Lestrange (IV)|Corvus]], through whom she was the grandmother of [[Leta Lestrange]] and [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus Lestrange]].<ref>{{COG}} {{see image|File:LestrangeFamilyTree HighRes.png}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Eglantine's name originates from Old French and it means "spiny, needle-like", which is in reference to the thorns of the eglantine, which is a wild rose also known as sweet briar.

==Behind the scenes==
*Unlike all other spouses included in the family tree ([[Heloise Lestrange|Heloise Beaufort]], [[Minette Lestrange|Minette Rosier]], [[Laurena Kama]], and [[Clarisse Lestrange|Clarisse Tremblay]]), Eglantine is depicted with the Lestrange surname. This might signify a case of [[inbreeding]], since this was reported as a practise of the [[Lestrange family]].<ref>{{WW|the-malfoy-family}} - "The family has, however, eschewed the somewhat dangerous practise of inter-marrying within such a small pool of pure-bloods that they become enfeebled or unstable, unlike a small minority of fanatic families such as the Gaunts and Lestranges"</ref>
**A family tree released later reveals that Eglantine and Corvus (III) were first cousins, as their fathers (Falco and Corvus (II), respectively) were brothers.<ref name="family tree"/>
