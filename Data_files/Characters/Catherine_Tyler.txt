'''Catherine Tyler''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] that lived in [[Yorkshire]], who once planned to elope with a [[Wizard|wizard]], [[Horatio Cloke]].

==Biography==
Catherine Tyler was a [[Muggle]], who fell in love with a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], [[Horatio Cloke]]. They once planned to elope, and Horatio stashed away a chest full of gold and jewels to take when they did. Catherine had half a key to open the chest.<ref name="FBC9-4">{{FBC|9|4}}</ref> However, they didn't elope and when Horatio died, he turned into a [[Ghost|ghost]] who haunted [[Cloke Mansion]].<ref name="FBC9-1">{{FBC|9|1}}</ref>

Catherine went on to gain a granddaughter, [[Megan Scott]]. She later gave her the key to chest and a map of the area, and told her to 'seek her past' and that '[[Horatio Cloke|Cloke]] knows the truth'. Catherine soon died, and her granddaughter pursued seeking what her grandmother told her to.<ref name="FBC9-1"/> [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and her partner had to help Megan when she was attacked by [[Jacturus Cloke III]], and they found and gave her the chest.<ref name="FBC9-4"/> 

==Behind the scenes==
*Despite being a Muggle, Catherine seemingly had the ability to see her lover Horatio Cloke's ghost; {{PM}} states that Muggles lack the ability to properly visualise ghosts, unlike wizards.
