{{Quote|Not exactly Picasso, are you? I hope you demonstrate more talent on the [[Quidditch]] pitch this weekend then you do as an artist.|[[Severus Snape]] catches [[Harry Potter]] with a drawing by [[Draco Malfoy]].|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)}}

'''Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Clito Ruiz y Picasso''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] artist. His works are known in both the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] and the [[Wizarding world]].<ref>[http://imsdb.com/scripts/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban.html ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' script at the Internet Movie Script Database] (archived [http://web.archive.org/web/20090216093016/http://imsdb.com/scripts/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban.html here] via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine)</ref> However, it is also possible that [[Severus Snape]] only knew about him because he was a [[half-blood]], and therefore had more knowledge of the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] world than the average wizard.
