{{Quote|Hogwarts sure has declined since I was Headmaster.|The portrait|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}
This '''[[Wizardkind|wizard]]''' was appointed [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] at some point before [[Armando Dippet|Professor Dippet]]. After his [[death]], his [[portrait]] was hung in the [[Headmaster's office]], in order to give advice to the current head. The large text on his portrait reads ''"TV NE CEDE MALIS SED CONTRA AVDEN-TIOR ITO"'' which may translate as ''"do not give in to evil but proceed ever more boldly against it."''<ref name="MHP">{{MHP}}</ref>

Apparently a disciplinarian, this individual's portrait was critical of the way [[Albus Dumbledore]] ran the school. At the end of their [[fourth year]], when [[Jacob's sibling]] was summoned to the [[Headmaster's Office]] after having discovered the [[Forest Vault]] and breaking the [[sleepwalking curse]], this portrait referred to them as "''a troublemaker''".<ref name="HM">{{HM|4|16}}</ref>
