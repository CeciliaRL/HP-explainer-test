'''Levina Monkstanley''' (fl. [[1772]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who worked as an [[Unspeakable]] for the [[Department of Mysteries]] in the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="WBoS"/>

==Biography==
An accomplished witch, Levina Monkstanley was the one who first [[Spell creation|developed]] the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]], ''Lumos,'' and the [[Wand-Extinguishing Charm]], ''Nox''. She astonished her colleagues one day by lighting the tip of her wand to look for a dropped quill in a dusty corner.<ref name="WBoS">{{WBS}} - see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9LNQV7cGIA&feature=relmfu this video]</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Spell creation]]''': Levina accomplished the immensely complex and difficult [[magic]]al art of inventing new [[spell]]s, as she was the inventor of the highly useful and practical [[Wand-Lighting Charm]], along with the [[Wand-Extinguishing Charm]], its [[Counter-charm]].<ref name="WBoS"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Levinia was very skilled with charms, given how she invented the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]] and [[Wand-Extinguishing Charm]] in her lifetime, and put them both to great use in her career at the [[Department of Mysteries]].<ref name="WBoS"/>

==Etymology==
'''Levina''' is of uncertain origin. It may derive from the [[Russia]]n for [[lion]] ''(lev)'', the Latin name "Lavinia," or the word "levin," an archaic term for a lightning bolt.

'''Monkstanley '''appears to be a combination of the two real-world surnames '''Monk''', an occupational surname which ultimately descends from the Greek for "solitary," and '''Stanley,''' which is of English origin and means "the stony meadow."
