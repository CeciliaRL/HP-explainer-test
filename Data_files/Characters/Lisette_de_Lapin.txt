}}'''Lisette de Lapin''' (fl. [[1422]]) was a [[France|French]] [[Wizardkind|sorceress]] who was convicted of practising [[Magic|witchcraft]] by [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s in the city of Paris in [[1422]], and was subsequently [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. She disappeared from her prison cell the evening before her scheduled execution.<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|B}} (Albus Dumbledore's notes)</ref>

==Animagus theory==
One theory was that she was an [[Animagus]] whose animal form was small enough to allow her to slip out the barred window. This idea has never been confirmed, but, sometime after Lisette's escape, a large white rabbit was spotted sailing across the English Channel in a [[cauldron]]. A rabbit fitting that description would later serve as an advisor to [[Henry VI|King Henry VI]].<ref name="TBB" />

==Inspiration for "Babbitty"==
Magical historians have suggested that Lisette de Lapin may have been the inspiration behind [[Beedle the Bard]]'s character [[Babbitty Rabbity|Babbitty]], who turns into a rabbit to escape the foolish [[King (Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump)|King]] and [[Charlatan]].<ref name="TBB" />

==Etymology==
"Lisette" is a French nickname for "Elisabeth"<ref>"[http://www.behindthename.com/name/lisette Lisette]" at [http://www.behindthename.com Behind the Name]</ref>. "''Lapin''" is the French word for "rabbit", which combined with the the [[Wikipedia:French_name#Particles|particle]] "''de"'' ("of") to form the surname "de Lapin", can be interpreted as meaning either "of the rabbit" or "of a place called "Lapin"."
