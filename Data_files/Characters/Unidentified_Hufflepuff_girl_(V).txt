This '''witch''' attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]]. She attended the school at some point between [[1908]] and [[1914]], as she can be seen in a class with [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]]. This would mean that she is in the same age group as Newt, so it is likely that she was either born in [[1896]] or [[1897]].

==Biography==
===Hogwarts years (1908-unknown)===
[[File:Hufflepuff girl riddikulus.jpg|thumb|left|The girl casts Riddikulus on a Boggart during class]]
She likely started attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1908]], being sorted into [[Hufflepuff]]. At some point during this time, she attended a class taught by [[Albus Dumbledore]]. She cast ''[[Boggart-Banishing Spell|Riddikulus]]'' on a [[Boggart in the Wardrobe|Boggart]], immediately before fellow student and Hufflepuff [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] did so.

==Behind the scenes==
*Despite appearing in the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvFybpmyB9E official Comic Con trailer], casting [[Boggart-Banishing Spell|Riddikulus]] just before [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], she ultimately did not appear in the film. She was presumably cut for having no significance to the overall plot.
