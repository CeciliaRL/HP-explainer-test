{{Quote|Oh, I’ve got Colonel Fubster managing [[Marjorie Dursley's unknown eleven bulldogs|them]]. He’s retired now, good for him to have something to do.|[[Marjorie Dursley]] talking about Colonel Fubster|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban}}
'''Colonel Fubster''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] man who was a neighbour of [[Marjorie Dursley]].<ref name="POA2"/><ref name="accio">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2000/1000-livechat-barnesnoble.html Barnes and Noble & Yahoo! chat with J.K. Rowling]</ref> After his retirement from the [[Wikipedia:British Armed Forces|British Armed Forces]], he apparently spent a lot of time with her, and was willing to do her favours.<ref name="POA2">{{POA|B|2}}</ref> He watched over [[Marjorie Dursley's unknown eleven bulldogs|her dogs]] when she went to visit her [[Vernon Dursley|brother]] and his [[Dursley family|family]] in the summer of [[1993]] (excepting [[Ripper]], who [[Marjorie Dursley|Marge]] took along on the trip, as she said he couldn't stand to be parted from her).<ref name="POA2" />

The [[1992|year before]], he drowned one of Marge's pups at her request, as she considered it a "weak," "underbred", "ratty little thing." Marge also claimed to have accidentally shattered a [[wine]] glass on a visit to the Colonel's house the day before she left to visit her [[Vernon Dursley|brother]].<ref name="POA2" />

Marge was secretly in [[love]] with him, but he never married her due to their conflicts in personality. This in turn fueled much of Marge's unpleasant demeanour, taking it out on [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="pottermore">{{PM}} - Chapter 2 - "Aunt Marge's Big Mistake" - Aunt Marge</ref>
