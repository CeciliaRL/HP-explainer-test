This '''[[Wizardkind|witch]]''' (fl. c. [[16th century|1500s]]) was the great-grandmother of [[Zygmunt Budge]], one of the most accomplished [[Potioneer]]s ever known. She was remembered by her great-grandson as a "''distressingly giggly''" persona, in sharp contrast to his own personality.<ref name="BSlaughingpotion">{{WBS}} - see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6W3FZULBtU&index=18&list=PLu-YMfPspAuGcYXaC2J1A2gb-0Zp34GI3 this video]</ref>

Budge's great-grandmother had an old recipe for the [[Laughing Potion]] that she handed down to him as a child. In his adult years in reclusion in the [[Hermetray|Isle of Hermetray]], Budge set himself the challenge of refining that recipe. He later used it on a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbour from the [[Isle of Harris]] who thought himself funny and was determined to make fun of him â€” a drink from Budge's potion made him laugh for a week straight, after which he retired to a silent monastery, having developed an aversion for all things funny.<ref name="BSlaughingpotion"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': This witch was very accomplished with the [[magic]] of potion making, having taught her grandson [[Zygmunt Budge]] much about brewing potions, as well as having devised her own recipe for the [[Laughing Potion]].<ref name="BSlaughingpotion"/>
