==Etymology==
The name "Kylie" arose in [[Australia]], where it means "boomerang" in Noongar,<ref>[https://www.noongarculture.org.au/glossary/noongar-word-list/ Noongar Culture]</ref> an Australian Aboriginal language. It is more likely a feminine form of Kyle, and it is in this capacity that it began to be used in [[United States of America|America]] in the [[1970s]]. A famous bearer is the Australian pop singer {{Wplink|Kylie Minogue}} ([[1968]]-).
