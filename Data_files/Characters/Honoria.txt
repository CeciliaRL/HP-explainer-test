'''Honoria''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the spinster aunt of [[Albus Dumbledore]]. She was once engaged to a [[Honoria's fiancé|wizard]] who worked in the [[Improper Use of Magic Office]], but broke off her engagement to him, claiming that he had a "[[Hairy Heart|hairy heart]]" (a [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] expression for a person who is unfeeling). Rumour had it that her real reason for ending the engagement was catching her fiancé fondling some [[Horklump]]s.<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|H}}</ref>

==Etymology==
''Honoria'' is a feminine form of the late Roman name ''Honorius'', meaning "honour". Some early saints and popes and one king held this name.

==Behind the scenes==
*It is unknown whether Honoria was the sister of [[Percival Dumbledore]] or his wife [[Kendra Dumbledore|Kendra]]. In the simplified [[Chinese]] translation of {{TBB|R}}, the translation of "aunt" used (姑妈) refers to the father's elder sister,<ref>{{Wtlink|姑妈}}</ref> but this remains unconfirmed by [[J. K. Rowling]].<ref>[[:zh:霍诺利亚]]</ref>
*It is possible that Honoria is [[Credence Barebone's aunt]] which would confirm that [[Credence Barebone|Credence]] is indeed Aurelius Dumbledore.
