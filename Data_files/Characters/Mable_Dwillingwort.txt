{{Quote|Invented and first cast by a prolific witch, named Mable Dwillingwort on discovering that burgalars ''[sic]'' were trying to steal her [[potion]]s.|Student's answer on [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam paper|A Guide to the Graphic Arts Department: Posters, Prints, and Publications from the Harry Potter Films}}
'''Mable Dwillingwort''' may have been a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived in the [[12th century]]. According to one student's answer on their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]] exam for the Theory of [[Charm]]s (for which they cited the [[Wizarding Archive of 1152]]), she was the [[Spell creation|inventor]] of the [[Bat-Bogey Hex]] which she developed to ward off burglers who were trying to steal her potions.<ref name="HPLEG">{{HPLE|G}} - {{see image|File:OWL Exam.png}}</ref> However, [[Miranda Goshawk]] claimed to invent this spell herself in the [[Book of Spells]],<ref name="WBS">{{WBS}}</ref> so it is unclear if the student's answer was incorrect, or if Goshawk was not the original inventor.
