==Behind the scenes==
*This student was only featured in the [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube)|console version]] of {{POA}}.
*Based on his name, it can be presumed that he is of Indian descent.
*Due to the games being released independently, it is not specified if he is related to [[Rowan Khanna]]. However, Rowan mentions having a brother in passing, and Ashok is in an appropriate age range to fit the possibility of being said brother.
