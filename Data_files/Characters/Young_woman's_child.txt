{{Quote|My baby is grievously ill. Won't you please help us? Your father bade me come if troubled –|The [[young woman]] to the [[Wizard (The Wizard and the Hopping Pot)|Wizard]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}

The '''young woman's child''' was a character in the tale ''[[The Wizard and the Hopping Pot]]'' by [[Beedle the Bard]]. The child was very ill, and when its [[Young woman|mother]] asked the [[Wizard (The Wizard and the Hopping Pot)|Wizard]] for help, he slammed the door on her. Later, when the Wizard could bear no more of his father's [[The Hopping Pot|lucky cooking pot]], he doused the baby in [[Dittany]] and it woke "well and rosy".<ref name="TBBW">{{TBB|W}}</ref>
