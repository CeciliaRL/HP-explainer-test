'''Winifred Whittle''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who established the [[Witches' Holistic Institute for Friends of Fairies]] (or, simply, WHIFF) of which only she and [[Sage Bragnam]] were members.<ref name="FBC3.1"/>

==Biography==
She was openly critical of [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], denouncing them for cutting down the forest where [[Fairy|fairies]] lived. She lived in a cottage in a forest inhabited by [[magic]]al [[creature]]s.<ref name="FBC3.1">{{FBC|3|1}}</ref>

[[Bethany Harrison]], the daughter of the [[Don Harrison|foreman]] of the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] construction works, was scared of her and included her in [[Bethany Harrison's sketch|a drawing of the forest]] in which she was depicted as a green-skinned [[hag]] with sharp teeth.<ref name="FBC3.1"/> While at first, [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] suspected it might be Whittle that was attacking the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] construction workers in an attempt to scare them away from the forest, after meeting her, she dismissed it, regarding her as "a harmless fairy fanatic".<ref name="FBC3.1"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
