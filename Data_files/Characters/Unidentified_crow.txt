This '''[[crow]]''' sat on the top of a wooden marker, holding [[Buckbeak]] the [[Hippogriff]]. The crow appeared to be a kind of guard, biting [[Harry Potter]] when he tried to free Buckbeak. The crow then flew away when the [[Walden Macnair|Executioner]] used his [[axe]] to cut a [[pumpkin]] from [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s [[Rubeus Hagrid's pumpkin patch|patch]] in two.<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}}</ref>
