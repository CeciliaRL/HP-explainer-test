==Biography==
In the summer of [[1991]], he was very confused when he had to deliver [[egg]]s to [[Petunia Dursley]] through the window of [[4 Privet Drive]], after [[Vernon Dursley]] had boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors of the house so that nobody could go in or out. Each of the two dozen eggs contained a [[Hogwarts acceptance letter]] rolled up and hidden inside it.<ref name="PS3">{{PS|B|3}}</ref>
