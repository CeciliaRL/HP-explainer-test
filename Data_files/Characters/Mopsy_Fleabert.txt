'''Mopsy Fleabert'''<ref name="Pottermore">{{PM}} - [http://www.pottermore.com/en/trunk/books/item/animal-ghosts-of-britain Trunk Description: "Animal Ghosts of Britain"]</ref> was an eccentric elderly [[Wizardkind|witch]] who lived at the edge of [[Hogsmeade]]. She was especially fond of [[dog]]s, and kept several, much to the chagrin of her neighbours.<ref name="jkrofficial">"[http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=4 Mopsy the dog-lover]" from [http://www.jkrowling.com J.K. Rowling's Official Site] (archive [https://web.archive.org/web/20060316221012/http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=4 here] via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine)</ref>

Mopsy wrote a series of books on [[animal ghost]]s.<ref name="Pottermore"/> A copy of one of the books in the series, ''[[Animal Ghosts of Britain]]'', was kept on the mantle in [[Gryffindor Tower]] in [[1994]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*[[J. K. Rowling]] has stated that she initially wished to include a dog-lover in the story to contrast with the cat-loving [[Arabella Figg]]. Mopsy would take [[Sirius Black]] into her home while he was on the run, thinking he was a stray dog. However, Rowling's editor asked her to cut Mopsy out of an early draft of {{GOF}}. Rowling chose to have fugitive Sirius stay inside a cave instead, where he could freely discuss important matters with [[Harry Potter|Harry]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] without Mopsy's interference.<ref name="jkrofficial" />
*It is never explicitly stated that Mopsy the dog lover from {{JKRS}} and Mopsy Fleabert the author of ''[[Animal Ghosts of Britain]]'' from {{PM}} are the same individual; however, given the unique name with a tie to their similar interests, it is believed here these both refer to the same individual.
