'''Brice Badeaux''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] journalist who worked in the [[21st century]].<ref name="WU Triwizard"/>

==Biography==
In the winter period of [[2020]]-[[2021]], during the [[Calamity]], he became witness to multiple [[Foundable]] traces and reported them [[Internet|online]] in a serious breach of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy]]. This was in spite of [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] members taking all [[Muggle-Repelling Charm|precautions against discovery]]. When caught with a [[Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard]] [[golden egg]] Foundable, he attempted to run away with his evidence, but was caught and [[Memory Charm|obliviated]]. Brice seemed to have foreknowledge regarding the [[wizarding world]] and knew that he would be stopped and obliviated, raising concerns that he had been aided by [[The Unforgivable]], a secret cabal of apparent [[Dark Wizard]]s who appeared to manipulate the Calamity for their own gain.<ref name="WU Triwizard">{{WU}} ([[Brilliant Event: Triwizarding Secrets|Brilliant Event: Triwizard Secrets]])</ref>
