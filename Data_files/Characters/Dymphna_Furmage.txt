'''Dymphna Furmage''' ([[1612]]—[[1698]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who famously campaigned for the destruction of [[Pixie]]s after being abducted by them while holidaying in [[Cornwall]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:DymphnaFurmageCSgbc.png|150px|thumb|left|A younger Dymphna]]
===Early life===
Ms. Furmage was born in [[1612]], somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]].<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref> If she enrolled at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], she attended the school from around [[1623]] to [[1630]].

===Adulthood===
Sometime in the mid to late [[17th century|seventeenth century]], Furmage went on holiday to [[Cornwall]], in southwest [[England]]. There, she was the victim of an abduction by [[Pixie]]s, a species of pesky [[beast]] endemic to the region. As a result Ms. Furmage developed a mortal dread of them for the rest of her life.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

Later, and most assuredly fuelled by her fear of the [[Pixie]]s, she strongly campaigned for the [[British Ministry of Magic]] to "humanely [destroy]" all of the species. She failed, however, and ended up dying in [[1698]], still in mortal dread of the mischievous [[creature]]s. For her efforts, she was included on a [[Famous Witches and Wizards Cards|Famous Witch Card]], as part of the [[Chocolate Frog Card]] series.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*The name "Dymphna" is the anglicised form of ''Damhnait''. [[Wikipedia:Dymphna|Saint Dymphna]] was a seventh-century [[Ireland|Irish]] saint who was martyred by her father. She is the patron saint of the mentally ill.
*"Furmage" is an alternate form of the Old French word "fromage," meaning cheese. It is descended from the Latin "formare," meaning "to shape" or "to fashion."

==Behind the scenes==
*The [[British Ministry of Magic]] was founded in [[1707]], nearly ten years after her [[death]]. it is possible that she tried to convince the [[Wizard's Council]], or that she returned as a [[ghost]].
