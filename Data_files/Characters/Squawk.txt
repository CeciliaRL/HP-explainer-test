==Biography==
[[File:Squawk sleeping.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Squawk sleeping]]
During the [[1986â€“1987 school year]], in the [[Hippogriff Clubhouse]], Kettleburn asked [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Liz Tuttle]] to take care of her while he was away helping a [[Magical Creatures Reserve in Ireland|Magical Creatures Reserve]] in [[Ireland]] with their [[Chimaera]]. 

While the club members were distracted by discussing a bad omen that [[Barnaby Lee]] saw while practising [[Cartomancy]], Liz realised Squawk was gone. She presumably had used her [[Choranaptyxis|choranaptyxic]] ability to shrink herself and slipped out without being noticed.<ref name="ABO" />

She went to the [[Courtyard]], and after she was gone, the students found some torn paper from a mysterious package sent to the [[Hippogriff Club]] along with her feathers on the ground. She had also been to [[Room 234-00|Filch's office]] and wreaked havoc there, leaving some more paper. The students devised a plan to lure her out by taking advantage of the Occamy's protective instincts towards their eggs.<ref name="ABO" />

As true [[Occamy egg]]s are extremely rare and expensive, even [[Jae Kim]] couldn't obtain any, so they used silver painted [[Ostrich egg]]s as a substitute. [[Jacob's sibling]] and [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] then used [[Fire-Making Spell|Incendio]] to create small, controlled fires to simulate danger. Though an adult Occamy wouldn't have been fooled by the ruse, Squawk was. She protectively encircled the eggs, allowing [[Liz Tuttle|Liz]] to capture her.<ref name="ABO" />

Later, the students determined that the package that Squawk had destroyed was a first edition copy of ''[[Have Yourself a Fiesta in a Bottle!]]'' by [[Libatius Borage]] that the [[Castelobruxo Hippogriff Club]] had sent them as a goodwill gift. They were eventually able to recover enough pieces to [[Mending Charm|restore]] the book and sent the Castelobruxo club some [[Laughing Potion]] brewed from the book's recipe in return. Squawk was present when the Hippogriff Club decided to throw [[Hippogriff Club's first fiesta|their own fiesta]], that is, party.<ref name="ABO" />
