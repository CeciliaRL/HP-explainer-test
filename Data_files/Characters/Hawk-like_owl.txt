{{Quote|A little owl with a slightly flattened, [[hawk]]-like head peered down at them from one of the branches.|Description|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows}}
A '''hawk-like [[owl]]''' could be seen at times perched in one of two aged crab-apple trees in the front garden of the [[Lovegood House|Lovegoods' home]].<ref name="DH20">{{DH|B|20}}</ref> It is unknown if any [[Wizardkind|wizard]] owned this owl, but it may have belonged to the [[Lovegood family|Lovegoods]].

==Behind the scenes==
*This may be the owl [[Xenophilius Lovegood]] used to deliver a message to the [[Death Eaters]] to inform them that [[Harry Potter]] was in his house.
*This owl may be a Northern Hawk Owl (''Surnia ulula''), a species known for its similarities with hawks.
*It is not a [[Wikipedia:Eurasian Eagle Owl|Eurasian Eagle Owl]] as the text describes it as small, while this species is one of the world's largest.
