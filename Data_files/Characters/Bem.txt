'''Bem'''<ref>Closed captioning on the DVD release of {{POA|F}}</ref> (born c. [[1979]]–[[1980]]<ref name="age" />) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] of [[Nigeria]]n descent<ref>[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban.html ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' script] on IMSDb (archived [http://web.archive.org/web/20090216093016/http://imsdb.com/scripts/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban.html here] via the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine)</ref> who attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] from [[1991]] to [[1998]].<ref name="poafilm">{{POA|F}}</ref> He was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]] and was in [[Harry Potter]]'s year, however he did not share a dormitory with Harry and his friends.

==Biography==
===Hogwarts education===
====Early years====
Being [[Nigeria]]n in descent, Bem began his education at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in [[1991]], along with students [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]] and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]].<ref name="age" /> He was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into the house of [[Gryffindor]], but would not share a dormitory with the other known Gryffindor boys in his year.<ref name="poafilm" />

===Third year===

Bem chose [[Care of Magical Creatures]] and [[Divination (class)|Divination]] as electives in his [[1993–1994 school year|third year]].<ref name="poafilm" /> Bem explains the meaning after [[Sybill Trelawney]] found a grim in [[Harry Potter|Harry's]] teacup. He is seen again in the Main Hall studying as [[Seamus Finnigan|Seamus]] told everyone that [[Sirius Black]] was sighted at an area close to Hogwarts. He agreed with Seamus that Sirius can get passed the Dementors and believed that he would do it again.

===Fifth year===

In his [[fifth year]] (the [[1995–1996 school year]]), Bem became a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]], in order to learn practical defensive magic from [[Harry Potter]] and to rebel against the tyrannical and incompetent [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] [[professor]] [[Dolores Umbridge]].<ref name="OOTPF">{{OOTP|F}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
He was a black boy with dark eyes and a round face. He was also slightly overweight with a lisp.<ref name="poafilm"/>

==Etymology==
The name Bem means "peace" in the language of the [[Wikipedia:Tiv|Tiv]], of [[Wikipedia:Nigeria|Nigeria]] and [[Wikipedia:Cameroon|Cameroon]] and also means "good" or "well" in Portuguese.<ref>''The New Age Baby Name Book'' by Sue Browder</ref> "BEM" is also an abbreviation for ''British Empire Medal'', a medal received from British royalty for meritorious civil or military service, which reflects Bem being [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into Gryffindor.

==Behind the scenes==
*Like the character [[Nigel Wolpert]], Bem is not mentioned in the [[Harry Potter (book series)|books]], but is credited in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|films]]. Played by [[Ekow Quartey]],<ref name="actor">[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1600606/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t46/ Ekow Quartey - IMDB]</ref> the character is listed in the credits for ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' as simply "Boy 1". However, on the ''Prisoner of Azkaban'' DVD, the [[Wikipedia:Closed captioning|closed captions]] identify the character as "Bem" during the Divination class scene.
*Bem cannot be considered [[canon]], as the books identify in several places that there are only five [[Gryffindor]] boys in Harry's year: [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley]], [[Neville Longbottom]], [[Seamus Finnigan]] and [[Dean Thomas]].
*Bem also makes an appearance as a member of [[Dumbledore's Army]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (film)|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]''. His house was changed to [[Ravenclaw]], probably to correct their mistake of putting him in Gryffindor last time. He appears in the credits as "Ravenclaw boy".
