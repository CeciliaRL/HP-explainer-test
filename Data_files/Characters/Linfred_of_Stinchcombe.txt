'''Linfred of Stinchcombe''', also known by the nickname '''The Potterer''',<ref name="PM"/> was a [[12th century|twelfth-century]] [[wizardkind|wizard]] and pioneering [[potioneer]], credited with inventing many medicinal [[potion]]s. He was the founding patriarch of the [[Potter family]].<ref name="PM">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref>

==Biography==
In the [[12th century]], Linfred lived in the village of [[Stinchcombe]], [[wikipedia:Gloucestershire|Gloucestershire]], where he had a reputation as an eccentric, absent-minded man.<ref name="PM"/> Nonetheless, his helpful nature and affability made him universally liked and his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours often came to him seeking remedies for their ailments. He was always able to brew these [[potion]]s for them, using ingredients readily-available from his garden.<ref name="PM"/>

The Muggles remained unaware that Linfred's remedies were [[magic]]al and thus continued thinking of him as just a strange, lovable man who enjoyed "pottering about in his garden with all his funny plants."<ref name="PM"/> This lead to him being given the nickname "the Potterer", which over the years was corrupted into simply "Potter."<ref name="PM"/>

As his neighbours did not know he was a [[wizardkind|wizard]], Linfred was able to conduct experiments in peace, inventing a number of medicinal potions (including ones which later developed into [[Skele-Gro]] and [[Pepperup Potion]]).<ref name="PM"/> He sold these potions to fellow witches and wizards, amassing great wealth in the process.<ref name="PM"/>

Linfred fathered seven children. He left each of them a significant amount of [[galleon|gold]] upon his death. His eldest son, [[Hardwin Potter|Hardwin]], married [[Iolanthe Peverell]].<ref name="PM"/>

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Linfred was a master [[Potioneer]] and inventor in the twelfth century. He invented a number of medicinal potions that were used and manufactured long after his death.<ref name="PM"/>
*'''[[Healing magic]]''': Linfred was also highly accomplished in healing magic, having developed several powerful healing potions, such as [[Skele-Gro]] and the [[Pepperup Potion]].<ref name="PM"/>
*'''[[Herbology]]''': He possessed considerable skills in Herbology, as he was able to grow the plants in his garden needed for ingredients in brewing potions.<ref name="PM"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Linfred of Stinchcombe's life story echoes that of [[The Wizard and the Hopping Pot]] from {{TBB}}, and may have been the inspiration for the story.
