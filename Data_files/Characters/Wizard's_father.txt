{{Quote|There was once a kindly old wizard who used his magic generously and wisely for the benefit of his neighbours.|Description of the wizard's father|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}

The '''wizard's father''' was the father of the [[Wizard (The Wizard and the Hopping Pot)|young wizard]] who despised [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] in ''[[The Wizard and the Hopping Pot]]''. The father used all his [[magic]] to help his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours' illnesses and woes. He died at a goodly age, leaving all his belongings to his only son, who had none of the qualities his father had. One of the belongings he left to his son was his [[The Hopping Pot|lucky cooking pot]], which he enchanted in the hope that it would give him a lesson by experiencing the troubles of the [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]' misery. The pot made the son's conscience awaken, and the young wizard agreed to use his magic to help his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours as his father had done before him.<ref name="TBB"/>

===The Lucky Cooking Pot===

{{Quote|From miles people came to him with their troubles, and the [[Wizardkind|wizard]] was pleased to give his pot a stir and put things right.|How the old wizard uses his magic|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}   

The father used his pot to brew [[potion]]s and [[antidote]]s for the local [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] when they needed his help.<ref name="TBB">{{TBB|W}}</ref> He brewed a potion to help an old woman's granddaughter's warts and he bade a young woman to come if she had any trouble with her baby.<ref name="TBB" /> However, generous as he was, he was wise enough to know not to reveal the source of his [[magic]] to his neighbours and instead he pretended that all his [[potion]]s, [[charm]]s, and [[antidote]]s sprang ready-made from the little [[cauldron]] he called his "lucky cooking pot".<ref name="TBB" />


===Death===
[[File:The Wizard and the Hopping Pot.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The wizard running away from his father's enchanted Hopping Pot]]

{{Quote|This well-beloved [[Wizardkind|wizard]] lived to a goodly age, then died, leaving all his chattels to his only son.|The old wizard's will|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}

On his [[death]], the wizard leaves all his belongings to his only son, who has none of the qualities or virtues his father had, one of the things mentioned to be included was the hopping pot that the wizard gave to him in hope that it would give him a lesson by giving him an experience of the Muggles' misery.<ref name="TBB" /> After his father's death, the son finds the pot and a single slipper inside it, together with a note from his father that reads, "In the fond hope, my son, that you will never need this."<ref name="TBB" /> Bitter for having nothing left but a pot, the son resolved to henceforth use the pot as a rubbish pail and decides to close the door on every person who asks for his help.<ref name="TBB" />

{{Quote|A kind old [[Wizardkind|wizard]] decides to teach his son a lesson by giving him the taste of the local [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s' misery. The young [[Wizardkind|wizard]]'s conscience awakes and he agreed to use his magic for the benefit of his [[Muggle|non-magical]] neighbours.|[[Albus Dumbledore]]'s Notes|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}

The kind old [[Wizardkind|wizard]] decided to teach his son a lesson by giving him a taste of the [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]' misery by enchanting his "hopping pot" to, if the son refused to help his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours' troubles, to remind him of their sicknesses. His son's conscience awoke and he agreed to use his magic to help his [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] neighbours.<ref name="TBB" />

{{Quote|In the fond hope, my son, that you will never need it.|The old wizard's note that was left in the Hopping Pot|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}

He had a difficult relationship with his son as they had two different views of how things are.<ref name="TBB" /> The son thought that those who could not do magic were worthless, a thought shared by wizard fanatics some years later when Muggle persecution of wizards and witches began.<ref name="TBB" />

When his father only left him an old cooking pot and a slipper, he cursed his father's age-softened mind as he had expected gold.<ref name="TBB" /> However, after he was given the taste of the [[Non-magic people|Muggles]]' misery, his conscience awoke and he agreed to use his magic to help his Muggle neighbours as his father did before him.<ref name="TBB" />

===Muggle neighbours===

{{Quote|Your father bade me to come if troubled.|A young [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] woman asking for help|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}

The wizard enjoyed helping his Muggle neighbours with their dreadful woes.<ref name="TBB" /> However, he did not confide them with the source of all his magic and instead told the that all his potions, charms, and antidotes sprang ready-made from a little cauldron.<ref name="TBB" />

Two of the known [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] that the father helped were a peasant whom he gave her a "special poultice" for her granddaughter's warts and he bade a young woman that if she had run into any trouble with her baby, he would be glad to help.<ref name="TBB" />
