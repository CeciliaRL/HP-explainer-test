'''Dougal McGregor''' was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]], son of [[Dougal McGregor's father|a farmer]].

==Biography==
He was handsome and intelligent. He and [[Minerva McGonagall]] were briefly engaged in the summer of [[1954]]; he asked her to marry him and at first she accepted, but she later decided not to do it as she had not told him she was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and she thought it would mean the end of her career at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]]. She also remembered how it was hard for her mother when she married her [[Minerva McGonagall's father|muggle father,]] whom she was close to. Dougal sent her several [[Dougal McGregor's letters to Minerva McGonagall|letters]] trying to win her back, but with no success. He would later marry a [[Dougal McGregor's wife|Muggle woman]] who was the daughter of [[Dougal McGregor's wife's father|another local farmer]].<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|professor-mcgonagall}} (transcription available [http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?s=4a2e751bddc00f9618a0b1bb6d9ce6fc&p=481284&postcount=443 here])</ref>

Dougal McGregor was murdered in a random anti-[[Non-magic people|Muggle]] attack by the [[Death Eaters]] during the height of the [[First Wizarding War]] in the [[1970s]], along with [[Dougal McGregor's wife|his wife]] and [[Dougal McGregor's children|children]].
