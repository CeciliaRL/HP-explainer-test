{{Quote|Oh hello... hmmm... a right odd lot we have here. The name is Basil Ardent Aurelius III, misplaced wizard, gentleman scholar. Now tell me what secret society are you and what are your nefarious ends?|Basil Aurelius III greeting a group of students|Harry Potter: Magic Awakened}}
'''Basil Ardent Aurelius III''' was a [[wizard]] scholar. There was a [[portrait]] of him inside the [[Hogwarts Castle]].<ref name="MA"/>

==Biography==
The portrait of Basil Ardent Aurelius III had once been placed at the [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]] [[Grand Staircase]], but was moved to the [[Chamber of Secrets]] during the [[Battle of Hogwarts]].<ref name="MA"/>

During the [[2009â€“2010 school year]], a group of students, in search of a map that would lead to a family heirloom, went down to the chamber following [[Prentiss Pagett-Goggins]]'s clue and heard him asking for help. After meeting them, he said the heirloom was in a secret passage, but the only person who knew where was his friend [[Harold]], who had left Hogwarts before he came down here and was now in the [[Hog's Head Inn]]. He then noticed [[Bly]] far off in the chamber and mistook him to also be one of the group, leading to Bly [[Charm|animating]] one of the snake statues to attack the students. Basil was later returned to the Grand Staircase and reunited with his neighbours, namely [[Prentiss Pagett-Goggins]] and [[Harold]], after the students found them and returned them to their original place.<ref name="MA"/>
