'''Officer''' '''Cerberus Langarm''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and an [[Officer]] in the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]], where he worked as an [[Auror]]<ref name="WU">{{WU}} ([[SOS Task Force Training]] - Arurorial Appraisal: Resilience Training)</ref> under the command of [[Harry Potter]]. Considered a 'celebrated' one, he took great pride in his position.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]], Cerberus Langarm was the scion of a family of unknown wizarding descent. Like nearly all other magical children born in the wizarding community of Great Britain, Cerberus presumably attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref>“Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,” [Lupin] replied. “That was announced yesterday. It’s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, '''nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts''', but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred.”- Remus Lupin, {{DH}}.</ref> A gifted student, he earned good marks on his exams, earning at least an 'Exceeds Expectations' mark in five of his [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.]]<ref>Requirements to become a Hit Wizard is described in the [[1981|Daily Prophet]]<span> newsletters - Issue 2.</span></ref> examinations and graduating with similar results on his [[Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Test|N.E.W.T.s]].<ref name="OOTP29">In {{OOTP|B|29 (''Careers Advice'')}}, Minerva McGonagall establishes that Aurors require a minimum of five N.E.W.T.s, and nothing under 'Exceeds Expectations' in order to be eligible for training to join the Auror Office.</ref>

===Career as an Auror===
Sometime after his seventeenth birthday, Cerberus joined the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[London]], where he worked as an [[Officer]] in the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]].<ref>"I'm a Magical Law Enforcement Officer! I've trained to fight Dark wizards!" - Cerberus Langarm, {{FBC}}.</ref> Having undergone the three year long [[Auror training|training programme]] required to join to [[Auror Office]] and successfully passed the character and skill requirements needed to join the ranks of the official Dark Wizard catchers in the Ministry's employ, in the time that followed Cerberus fought and captured [[Dark Wizard|Dark wizards]] alongside among others [[Harry Potter]], [[Mordecai Berrycloth]], [[Dorian Fungbury]] and [[Penelope Fawley]], and became a celebrated Auror himself.<ref name="WU" /> 

In less dangerous times with a low amount of dark magical activity to combat, however, Aurors would also be tasked with patrolling the perimeters of magical creature reserves to ward off [[Wizard poacher|poachers]];<ref name="WU2">{{WU}} (Brilliant Event: Darkness Raising Part 2)</ref> and at least some of them, Cerberus among them, deemed the task of handling himself around magical creatures to be less dangerous than what he usually did.<ref>" "''I catch hardened criminals, Grimblehawk. I think I can handle one measly beast! Now, stand back while I break the door down!''" - Cerberus Langarm, {{FBC}}.</ref> It was during such a time that Officer Langarm had to resign himself to less dangerous assignments; and even spent some time actively pursuing petty criminals such as [[Silas Crump]].<ref name="FBC61">{{FBC|6|}}</ref>  

At one point, he also worked as something of a liaison officer between the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] and the [[Beast Division]] in the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], to whom he passed on intelligence regarding reports of creature-related incidents. On at least some occasions, he would lend his authority as a lawman to [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and her [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|partner]]; accompanying them to the scene of creature-related incidents to secure areas where wild [[beast|beasts]] was believed to be located in order to prevent further injuries,<ref name="FBC">{{FBC}}</ref> and assisted them by making investigative inquiries, and by retrieving and examining evidence for them.<ref>{{FBC}} (Case 5: Trouble Brewing)</ref>

In [[2019]], he hosted the [[Forum Quorum]], where his advice on the health benefits of proper rest before and after battle benefited [[Magizoologist|at least some]] members of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] in attendance. He would also eventually hold a [[Wilderness Wards|course]] in self-defensive spellwork that would give them an advantage in the [[Calamity|field]].<ref name=":0">{{WU}} (SOS Task Force Appraisal)</ref> He also was assigned with overseeing the [[Resilience Training]] of Aurors-in-training.<ref name=":0" />

==Personality and traits==
Known to take great pride in his position as an [[officer]] of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], Cerberus Langarm is a diligent, tough-minded individual, known to take his duties seriously and maintained an overall professional and largely courteous demeanour. Decisive in both thought and deed, he was above all else a man of action, often reaching for his wand to solve a problem rather than reason his way around it. One such example took place during his time working with the [[Beast Division]], whereupon Cerberus agreed to help to investigate the secret owlery of [[Bilius Finbok]], and was so quick to instinctively break down the door with [[Portaberto|a spell]] that he failed to realise that his co-workers had already [[Unlocking Charm|unlocked it]].<ref name="FBC5">{{FBC}} (''Case 5: Trouble Brewing'')</ref> He also had a somewhat old-fashioned and naive outlook on magical creatures, employing a "[[curse-to-kill]]" policy similar to the one for which the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] used to be well-known for back in the [[1920s]] when facing those he regarded as particularly dangerous.<ref name="FBC5" /> He also possessed a dry wit, and was not immune to the finding of amusements at other people's expense, as seen when he delegated the task of going through the accounts ledger from [[Slug & Jiggers Apothecary]] in [[Diagon Alley]] to Mathilda and her partner, telling her to "enjoy", despite the fact that he knew she was no more fond of paperwork than himself.<ref name="FBC5" /> Proud to a fault, he was also embarrassed about some of his own shortcomings and hence, reluctant to acknowledge them in front of other people, such as his fear of snakes.<ref name="FBC5" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
Highly skilled, incredibly well-trained and rather powerful, Cerberus Langarm was a very accomplished wizard, being more than proficient in both the theory of at least [[Potion]]s, [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Transfiguration]], [[Herbology]], and [[Charm]]s,<ref name="OOTP29"/> as well as adept in the application of that knowledge.
*'''[[Auror]] skills''': As an official Dark Wizard catcher, Cerberus Langarm was a very capable investigator trained extensively as to become a well-respected expert in his line of work, and responsible for his fair share of captures and arrests of dangerous [[Dark Wizard]]s over the course of his career at the [[Auror Office]].
*'''[[Martial magic]]''': As an Auror, Officer Langarm was an accomplished [[Duelling|duellist]], and had seen combat more than once in his time at the Ministry, and would go on to share his experiences with the Aurors-in-training working for the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] in order to help them contain [[Calamity|The Calamity]].<ref name="WU"/>

==Etymology==
His first name is the Latin version of [[wikipedia:Cerberus|Kerberos]] (''Κέρβερος''), the three-headed [[dog]] which in [[Greece|Greek]] legend guarded the entrance to Hades. His last name appear to be a pun on "long arm", as in the idiom [http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/long+arm+of+the+law long arm of the law], which is used to refer to the police.
