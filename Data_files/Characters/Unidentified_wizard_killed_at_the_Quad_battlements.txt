There, he ruthlessly killed this wizard, who was caught off-guard, with a [[Killing Curse]] before starting a duel with [[Arthur Weasley]].<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is unclear who this wizard was, as he only appeared for a split second in {{DH|F2}}. As he was by Order members [[Arthur Weasley]], [[Kingsley Shacklebolt]] and [[Remus Lupin]], there is the possibility he was a part of the [[Order of the Phoenix]], but it is more likely he was a member of the Hogwarts staff.
