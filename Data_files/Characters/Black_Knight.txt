The '''Black Knight''' was a [[ghost]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="pottermoreghosts"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*The Black Knight was one of the original ghosts created by [[J. K. Rowling]] but did not survive final edits.<ref name="pottermoreghosts">{{WW|hogwarts-ghosts}}</ref>
*Though the Black Knight is never mentioned by name in any of the novels, it is possible that the [[knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead]] that attended [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party]] was intended to be this character.
