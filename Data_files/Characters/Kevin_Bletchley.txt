==Etymology==
"Kevin" is the anglicised form of the Irish name ''Caoimhín'', derived from the older Irish ''Cóemgein'', composed of the Old Irish elements ''cóem'' "kind, gentle, handsome" and ''gein'' "birth". Saint Caoimhín established a monastery in Glendalough, Ireland in the 6th century and is the patron saint of Dublin. It became popular in the English-speaking world outside of Ireland in the 20th century.

Bletchley is a small Market town (now situated within Milton Keynes) in Buckinghamshire - home of Bletchley Park, the enigma code breaking machine.

==Behind the scenes==
*It is very likely that Kevin Bletchley was actually intended to be [[Miles Bletchley]], the Slytherin Keeper from the novels and films, but it is also possible that Miles does not exist in [[Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup|this game]].
