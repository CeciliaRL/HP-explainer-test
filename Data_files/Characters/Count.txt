{{Dialogue a-b|Hermione|No, Harry. Even in the wizarding world hearing voices isn't a good sign.|Count in portrait|She's right, you know.|[[Hermione Granger]] and [[portrait]] after [[Harry Potter]] hears voices|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)}}

This '''[[portrait]] of a count''' hangs next to the first-floor landing of the [[Grand Staircase]] of [[Hogwarts Castle]]. In [[1992]], [[Hermione Granger]] told [[Harry Potter]] that it was not a good sign to hear voices, even in the [[Wizarding world]], unaware that the voices he was hearing was really the [[Parseltongue]] of [[Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk]] going through the school's pipes. The subject of this portrait agreed with her.<ref>{{COS|F}}</ref>
