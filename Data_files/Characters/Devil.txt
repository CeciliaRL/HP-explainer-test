The '''devil''' is an entity believed in many religions (notably [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]) to be the embodiment of evil and the enemy of [[human]]kind.<ref name="wikipedia">"[[wikipedia:Devil|Devil]]" on Wikipedia</ref>

In certain Christian traditions, the devil was said to have once been an [[angel]] named Lucifer, cast out of heaven for disobeying [[God]].<ref name="wikipedia2">"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer Lucifer]" on Wikipedia</ref> The story of Lucifer's fall was covered in the book ''[[The Hierarchie of the Blessed Angells]]''.<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE|G}} {{see image|File:The Hierarchie of the blessed Angells.jpg}}</ref>

The [[Fat Lady]] described [[Sirius Black]] as having "eyes like the devil" after he attacked her [[portrait]] in [[1993]].<ref name="POAF">{{POA|F}} - Chapter 13 (''Flight of the Fat Lady'')</ref>
