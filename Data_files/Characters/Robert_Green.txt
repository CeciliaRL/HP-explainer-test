==Etymology==
The name "Robert" is from the Germanic name Hrodebert meaning "bright fame", derived from the Germanic elements hrod "fame" and beraht "bright". The Normans introduced this name to Britain, where it replaced the Old English cognate Hreodbeorht. It has been a very common English name since that time. He is also the England National Football Team 3rd Choice Goalkeeper, who ironically made an appalling mistake against the USA.
