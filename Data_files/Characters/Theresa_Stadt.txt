'''Theresa Stadt''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] who, somehow, managed to raise [[Mr Whiskers|a pet Manticore]] from infancy. When the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] was notified of this, they sent a [[Magizoologist]] member of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] to retrieve the [[Manticore]], which proved a "remarkably ghastly affair".<ref name="WU">{{WU}} (see [https://wizardsunitehub.info/profession-skill/pet-manticore/ this])</ref>
