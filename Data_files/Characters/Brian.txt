'''Brian''' was a boy who lived at [[Godric's Hollow]]. On the night of [[31 October]] [[1981]], he dressed up as a [[vampire]] for a [[Hallowe'en]] party in his house: mistaking a hooded [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] for a friend who was late for the party, he approached him, only to be stricken with fear as he peered into the man's hood and quickly stumbled back into his yard.<ref name=":0" />
