==Etymology==
The name "Vasco" comes from the medieval Spanish name Velasco which possibly meant "crow" in Basque. A famous bearer was the 15th-century Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, the first person to sail from Europe around Africa to India. ''Vasco'' is also the Spanish word for Basque, referring to the people of the Basque country, an autonomous community in Spain.
