==Biography==
Rappaport was the fifteenth person to be elected to the office of [[President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America|President]] of the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]].<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" />

Rappaport's term saw one of the greatest ever breaches of the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|International Statute of Secrecy]].<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> [[Dorcus Twelvetrees]], the daughter of Rappaport's [[Keeper of Treasure and Dragots]], [[Aristotle Twelvetrees]], revealed the locations of both the MACUSA headquarters and [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]], as well as information on how the wizarding community sought to hide itself, to a [[Muggle|No-Maj]] with whom she was infatuated, [[Bartholomew Barebone]].<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> Barebone, a [[Scourers|Scourer]] descendant, firmly believed in the existence of [[magic]], and that [[wizardkind|witches and wizards]] should be destroyed.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> He thus stole Dorcus's [[Dorcus Twelvetrees's wand|wand]] and sought to publicise all of the details about the wizarding world which she had told him.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" />

The fallout of this incident was profound.<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> The MACUSA was forced to relocate its headquarters because of all the No-Maj attention drawn to it and faced "humiliating" censure by the [[International Confederation of Wizards]].<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" /> Rappaport was required to testify before the ICW at a public inquiry, and admitted to them that she could not be certain that all No-Majs exposed to the leaked information had been [[Memory Charm|Obliviated]].<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" />

In [[1790]], Rappaport enacted [[Rappaport's Law]], which created total segregation between the magic and non-magic communities in the [[United States of America|United States]] by banning wizards and witches from [[marriage|marrying]] or befriending No-Majs, restricting them to interactions "necessary to perform daily activities."<ref name="pottermore-rappaport" />
