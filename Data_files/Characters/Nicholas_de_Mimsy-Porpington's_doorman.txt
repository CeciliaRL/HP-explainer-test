{{Quote|Yes. This nasty troll I hired is to keep the riffraff out. Not very bright though. If anyone were to crash the party, he's under strict orders to attack when I give the signal.

==Biography==
Before [[Hallowe'en]] in [[2009]], [[Lottie Turner]], [[Robyn Thistlethwaite]] and [[Unidentified Muggle-born Hogwarts student|another student]] encountered [[Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington]] in the [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[dungeons]]. Sir Nicholas introduced his doorman to the students and how, by saying "security", the troll would be summoned, which was exactly why the troll came and attacked the students. Just as he was about to hit Robyn with his club, [[Kevin Farrell]] arrived in time and cast the [[Jelly-Legs Curse]] on the troll, making him tumble to the ground.<ref name="MA"/>
