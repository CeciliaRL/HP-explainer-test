'''Greta Catchlove''' (b. [[1960]]) was a [[Wizardkind|witch]], who wrote the original edition of ''[[Charm Your Own Cheese]]''.<ref name="FWC" /> There was a portrait of Catchlove hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]], guarding a secret shortcut between the second-floor landing of the [[Grand Staircase]] and the [[Entrance Hall]] side room. The password required to gain access to said shortcut was "''Cheese Charmer''".<ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}} - PC version</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*An author named [[Gerda Curd]] is credited with having produced a revised edition of ''Charm Your Own Cheese''.<ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}} ([[Rumours!]] Magazine adverts.)</ref> It is possible that "Gerda Curd" is simply Catchlove's pen name.
*If she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], Catchlove might have been in the same year as the [[Marauders]], [[Lily J. Potter|Lily Evans]], and [[Severus Snape]]. If she was not, she was in the year behind them.

==Etymology==
"Greta" is a short form of ''Margareta''. A famous bearer of this name was Swedish actress Greta Garbo (1905-1990).
