'''Barnabus Blenkinsop''' (d. [[February]], [[1999]])<ref name=DoD /> was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. His death was announced in the ''[[Daily Prophet]]''. His obituary offered a reward for information about what happened to him, since all that was found in his bed in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo's]] was a can of [[anchovie]]s.<ref name="DP">{{DP}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*While the fate that befell Blenkinsop is ultimately unknown, the Ministry of Magic eventually solved the mystery of his disappearance, as prior to the [[London Five]] incident in [[2015]], no one in [[Great Britain]] had disappeared without a trace since the '[[Second Wizarding War|Dark Times]]'.<ref name="WU">{{WU}}</ref>
