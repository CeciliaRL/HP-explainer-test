'''Mrs Prewett''' was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], the wife of [[Molly Weasley's father|Mr Prewett]], and the mother of [[Gideon Prewett|Gideon]], [[Fabian Prewett|Fabian]], and [[Molly Weasley|Molly Prewett]] (later [[Weasley family|Weasley]]). She was the maternal grandmother of the [[Weasley family|Weasley]] children and great grandmother of [[Albus Potter|Albus]], [[James Potter II|James]] and [[Lily L. Potter|Lily Potter]], [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]], [[Dominique Weasley|Dominique]], [[Louis Weasley|Louis]], [[Molly Weasley II|Molly]], [[Lucy Weasley|Lucy]], [[Roxanne Weasley|Roxanne]], and [[Fred Weasley II|Fred]] Weasley, as well as [[Rose Granger-Weasley|Rose]] and [[Hugo Granger-Weasley]]. She was also the mother-in-law of [[Arthur Weasley]]. She could also be the niece of [[Muriel]].

She may or may not have had a big nose.<ref>[http://e-card.51.net/movie.scripts/Harry.Potter/Harry-Potter-and-the-Prisoner-of-Azkaban.htm| Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (script)]: Fred states that George's nose looks "positively massive" and is corrected that it is his - he says it is a family trait from Molly, implying that one of Molly's parents had a big nose too, though it is unknown as to which parents did.</ref>
