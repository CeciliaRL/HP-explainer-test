'''Minister Unctuous Osbert''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was [[Minister for Magic]] from [[1789]] to [[1798]]. His term in office was somewhat controversial, as he was accused of having been a puppet in the hands of [[Septimus Malfoy]].  Osbert was elected at least twice.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Unctuous was born a [[wizardkind|wizard]] into the [[Pure-blood]] or [[Half-blood]] Osbert family,<ref name="blood" /> somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]]. It is likely he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth.

===Minister for Magic===
Unctuous Osbert was elected [[Minister for Magic]] of [[Great Britain]] sometime into the late [[18th century|eighteenth century]].<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|the-malfoy-family}}</ref>

[[Septimus Malfoy]], a member of the powerful and wealthy [[Malfoy family]], was an enormously influential [[wizardkind|wizard]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] in the day and Minister Osbert was, during the course of his tenure, influenced to some degree by Malfoy's interests. Many claimed that Minister Osbert was little more than a puppet of Malfoy's, who would have been the ''de facto'' head of the Ministry.<ref name="Pottermore" />

Osbert left the office in [[1798]], to be succeeded by [[Artemisia Lufkin]].

==Etymology==
''Unctuous'' is an English word deriving from the Latin ''ungō'', meaning "I anoint with oil". The English word means "to be insincerely polite and earnest".
