'''Rosier''' was a [[Dark Wizard]] and one of the earliest [[Death Eaters]] of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]. He fought in the [[First Wizarding War]], and travelled to [[Hogsmeade]] in order to "wish good luck" to Tom Riddle in trying to get a teacher position at Hogwarts.<ref name="HBP20">{{HBP|B|20}}</ref> It is possible that Rosier was deceased before the start of the [[Second Wizarding War]]; if he was not, he possibly fought at the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] and was presumably killed or imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] after Voldemort's final defeat.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Nothing is known of Rosier's early life.

===First Wizarding War===
Rosier fought in the [[First Wizarding War]] along with many other Death Eaters. He was also one of the [[Death Eaters]] who travelled to [[Hogsmeade]], to say "good luck"'' ''to Voldemort, during his attempt to ask for work at Hogwarts, along with [[Nott]], [[Mulciber (Riddle-era)|Mulciber]], and [[Antonin Dolohov|Dolohov]].<ref name="HBP20"/> It is possible that he was the father of [[Evan Rosier]], who attended Hogwarts with [[Severus Snape]] in the [[1970s]], and who was killed by [[Auror]]s in the end of the [[First Wizarding War]]. After Voldemort's first downfall, Rosier was presumably killed, imprisoned, or defected. If he survived, it is most likely that he was one of the [[Death Eaters]] who did not search for Voldemort.

It is unknown if Rosier was still alive during the [[Second Wizarding War]].

==Behind the scenes==
*It's possible that he is related to [[Druella Black|Druella Rosier]], wife of [[Cygnus Black III|Cygnus Black]], given the timeline it's likely that the two are brother and sister or possibly cousins.
*He was possibly the father of [[Evan Rosier]] or [[Felix Rosier]]. The former was a known Death Eater while the latter was said to have a Death Eater father.<ref name="HM3">{{HM|3}}</ref>
*Rosier is not mentioned in the "Guide to Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters" on {{PM}}.
*It's possible that he was one of the boys seen with Tom Riddle in [[Horace Slughorn]]'s memory, though it is unconfirmed.
