==Biography==
On the morning of [[2 September]], [[1997]], this wizard ran into "[[Albert Runcorn]]" (actually [[Harry Potter]] in disguise) while entering the Ministry headquarters through the fireplaces in the [[Atrium]]. At first he seemed annoyed, but he excused himself and hurried away nervously when he noticed who he had bumped into.<ref name="DH12"/>

Later, when there were [[Infiltration of the Ministry of Magic|intruders detected]] in the Ministry, this wizard was sent to the [[Atrium]] in order to seal all exits and stop everyone from leaving. When "[[Albert Runcorn]]" (actually [[Harry Potter]]), "[[Mafalda Hopkirk]]" ([[Hermione Granger]]) and "[[Reginald Cattermole]]" ([[Ronald Weasley]]) were leading [[Muggle-born]]s in for [[Muggle-Born Registration Commission|questioning]] out to freedom, the wizard seemed aprehensive as to let them pass, but was intimidated by "Runcorn"'s threats and let them pass as [[Corban Yaxley|Yaxley]] emerged from one of the lifts. Harry, impersonating Runcorn, then told Yaxley that the balding wizard was trying to get the [[Muggle-born]]s out of the Ministry and punched him sending him flying through the air just before he jumped into one of the fireplaces and left the Ministry.<ref name="DH13">{{DH|B|13}}</ref>
