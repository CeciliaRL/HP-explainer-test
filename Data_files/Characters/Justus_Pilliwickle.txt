'''Justus Pilliwickle''' ([[1862]]-[[1953]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]], who worked for the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
Pilliwickle was born in [[1862]], somewhere in [[Great Britain]], into a family of unknown [[Blood status]]. He presumably attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth, being a British wizard. In his adult life, he was a celebrated Head of the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. He was featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]] for his impressive achievements in the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="COSG"/>

==Etymology==
''Justus'' is the latin word for equitable. This may indicate that Justus Pilliwickle was quite a fair and reasonable individual.

==Behind the scenes==
*If Justus Pilliwickle attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth, then he was Sorted in [[1873]] or [[1874]] (depending on his birthday being before or after 1 September, respectively), and would, thus, be on his [[second year|second]], [[third year|third]] or [[fourth year]] in [[1876]], when the school caretaker [[Rancorous Carpe|Mr Rancorous Carpe]] devised an "[[Rancorous Carpe's trap|elaborate trap]]" in an effort to remove [[Peeves]] from the Castle — which only resulted in Peeves getting hold of several cutlasses, crossbows, a blunderbuss and a miniature cannon, and forcing [[Headmaster|Headmistress]] [[Eupraxia Mole]] to evacuate the school for three days until she could manage to make [[Peeves' contract|a bargain with the poltergeist]].
