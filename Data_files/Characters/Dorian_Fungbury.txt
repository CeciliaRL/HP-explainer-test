{{Quote|A personal sojourn with noted Auror and decorated duellist Dorian Fungbury, increasing the amount of damage you can inflict against your Foes in combat.|Description|Harry Potter: Wizards Unite}}
'''Dorian Fungbury''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] employed by the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] in [[London]]; he was an accomplished [[Auror]] and a decorated [[Duelling|duellist]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}} (see [https://wizardsunitehub.info/profession-skill/somatic-casting/ this])</ref>

==Biography==
In the [[2010s]], Dorian Fungbury offered an informative stay over for an [[Auror]] member of the [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]]; learning from their host, they benefited from it when out in the field.<ref name="WU" />

In [[July]] [[2020]], [[Hermione Granger]] asked Dorian to do some digging into illegal beast trading. Since the [[Calamity]], the Ministry pulled recource away from combating the black market. He reached out to some underworld contacts and found that the black market - particularly the illegal Magical Creature market in [[Indonesia]] - has utterly exploded.<ref>{{WU}} "Brilliant Event: Baby Beast" (see [https://www.reddit.com/r/WizardsUnite/comments/hilafu/brilliant_event_baby_beasts_storyboard_week_1/ this])</ref>
