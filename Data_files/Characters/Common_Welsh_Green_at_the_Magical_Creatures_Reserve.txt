At some point, [[Rubeus Hagrid]] used up nearly all of [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]]'s dragon dung to fertilise the [[pumpkin]] patch in [[Rubeus Hagrid's garden|his garden]]. Jacob's sibling went caring for this Common Welsh Green with [[Penny Haywood]] and collected enough dragon dung for Hagrid.<ref name="HTBD"/>
