This '''[[Dark Wizard]] '''was a [[Death Eaters|Death Eater]] and servant of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] who participated and fought in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]]. During the early stages of the battle he was near the front of the group of Death Eaters who observed the protective enchantments placed around [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. He presumably fought in the Battle of Hogwarts where he was either killed or arrested and imprisoned in [[Azkaban]], though he was possibly one of the Death Eaters who opted to flee once [[Harry Potter]] revealed himself to be alive.<ref>{{DH|F2}}</ref>
