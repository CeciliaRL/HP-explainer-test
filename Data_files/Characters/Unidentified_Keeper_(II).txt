==Biography==
===Hogwarts years===
====1987–1988 school year====
{{Quote|They Keeper actually did a nice job with that goalpost.|[[Bean]]|Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery}}At some point by the [[1987–1988 school year]], she became the [[Keeper]] of her house's [[Quidditch team]]. She and other team members got into a confrontation with [[Jacob's sibling]] team, after [[Erika Rath]] injured [[Orion Amari]] in a [[Quidditch friendly]].<ref name="HMQch3">{{HM|4|Q3|1}}</ref>

After the match with Jacob's sibling's team, which ended in a brawl between the teams, this girl, along with the rest of the players, served detention under the supervision of [[Rolanda Hooch]]. The teams managed to prove their dedication to sportsmanship and cooperation and were not disqualified from the competition for the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup.<ref name="HMQch33">{{HM|4|Q3|3}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Which house she is in depends on that of [[Jacob's sibling]] (chosen by the player). If Jacob's sibling is in [[Gryffindor]], [[Hufflepuff]] or [[Slytherin]], this girl is in [[Ravenclaw]]. If [[Jacob's sibling]] is in Ravenclaw, she is in Slytherin.
