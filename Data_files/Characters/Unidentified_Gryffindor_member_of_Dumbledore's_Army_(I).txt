This '''girl''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor|Gryffindor House]]. However, [[Unidentified Hufflepuff member of Dumbledore's Army|her twin sister]] was sorted into [[Hufflepuff]].

==Biography==
===Education at Hogwarts===
She began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] with her twin sister in [[1991]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]]. Her twin sister, however, was sorted into [[Hufflepuff]].
====Fourth year====
In [[1994]], Hogwarts held the [[Triwizard Tournament]]. Her twin sister supported [[Cedric Diggory]] in the Tournament and wore a [[Potter Stinks badge]]. She shared [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] with students from the other houses this year and was taught by [[Professor]] [[Alastor Moody]], who was actually escaped Death Eater [[Bartemius Crouch Junior|Barty Crouch Jnr]] in disguise via [[Polyjuice Potion]]. At the end of the year, Cedric Diggory was murdered under [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]'s orders and Hogwarts held a [[Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory|Memorial Feast]] at which [[Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] announced [[Return of the Dark Lord|Voldemort's return]].<ref name="GOFF">{{GOF|F}}</ref>

====Fifth year====
In [[1995]], [[Dolores Umbridge]] was appointed as [[Hogwarts High Inquisitor]] and [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]] teacher, so that the [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] could watch over [[Albus Dumbledore]] after he and [[Harry Potter]] claimed [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] had returned. Umbridge refused to teach students any form of practical defence, and, given the circumstances, [[Hermione Granger]] felt that the student body needed a teacher who would, so then an alliance called [[Dumbledore's Army]] was formed. The Gryffindor girl's twin joined the D.A., and following in her sister's footsteps, she did so as well.<ref name="OOTPF">{{OOTP|F}}</ref>
