==Biography==
[[File:Derelict chateau.gif|250px|left|thumb|These Aurors at this mansion]]
In [[November]] or [[December]] [[1926]], these five Aurors were sent to a [[Derelict château]] somewhere in [[Europe]] that [[Gellert Grindelwald]] used as a hideout during his [[Grindelwald Attacks|attacks]]. While there it was night-time and it was very foggy. After entering the grounds, they edged slowly towards the Château with their [[wand]]s out, illuminated with the [[Wand-Lighting Charm]]. They were then hit with an unidentified [[dark charm]] that blew them back and killed them.<ref name="FBS1"/><ref name="FBF"/>
