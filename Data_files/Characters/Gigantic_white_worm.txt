==History==
The worm was the first obstacle on the way to the [[Fountain (The Fountain of Fair Fortune)|fountain]], wrapping around the base of the hill. [[Sir Luckless]] attempted to slay the worm with his sword, and [[Altheda]], [[Asha]] and [[Amata]] used magic against it, but the worm refused to let them pass until Asha began to weep. Then, it drank her tears and allowed the travellers to continue to the fountain.<ref name="TBBF">{{TBB|F}}</ref>
