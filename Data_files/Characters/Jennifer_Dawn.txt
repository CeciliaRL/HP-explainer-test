==Etymology==
*The name "Jennifer" comes from a Cornish form of the Welsh name ''Gwenhwyfar''. This name has only been common outside of Cornwall since the beginning of the 20th century, after it was featured in George Bernard Shaw's play ''The Doctor's Dilemma'' (1906).
*"Dawn" is the time each morning at which daylight first begins.
