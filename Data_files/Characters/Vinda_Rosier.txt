==Biography==
===Serving under Gellert Grindelwald===
Vinda Rosier became a loyal and devoted follower and acolyte of [[Gellert Grindelwald]] at some point before [[1927]]. She appeared to be Grindelwald's lieutenant.<ref name="COGS"/>
====Invasion of Parisian house====
[[File:Grindelwald Vinda Abernathy.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Vinda, Gellert, and Abernathy in the home]]
When Rosier and her fellow acolytes [[Killing Curse|killed]] the owners of a [[Unidentified home used by Gellert Grindelwald|house]], making it their hiding place, she spoke to Grindelwald about the world in which they would be able to kill every single [[Non-magic people|non-magic person]], but he told her that they would not kill every single one (that the "beast of burden" would always be necessary).<ref name="COGS"/>
[[File:Grindelwald skull hookah acolytes.gif|250px|thumb|right|Vinda watching Gellert as he shares his vision of Credence to them]]
While situated in the home used as headquarters, Vinda watched as [[Gellert Grindelwald]] used his [[Gellert Grindelwald's skull-hookah|skull-hookah]] to show them [[Credence Barebone]]'s [[Obscurus]], explaining that Barebone was the "only known entity alive that could kill [[Albus Dumbledore]]".
In the [[French Ministry of Magic Headquarters|French Ministry of Magic]] she enabled [[Abernathy]], under the [[Human transfiguration|disguise]] of an elderly lady, to safely depart from the Ministry with a stolen [[Lestrange family]] box from the [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room|Records Room]].<ref name="COGS"/>

====Finding Queenie====
Later on, Vinda located a distraught [[Queenie Goldstein]] and brought her to the [[Unidentified home used by Gellert Grindelwald|house]] being used by the [[Alliance]]. At the headquarters she comforted her and provided her with [[tea]]. When Queenie informed her she intended to leave so she could see her sister [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina]], Vinda confessed she was deeply committed to Grindelwald, their host, and he entered the room and implored Goldstein to join him.<ref name="COGS"/>
====Attending the rally====
[[File:Vinda joining Grindelwald.gif|250px|thumb|right|Vinda in the circle of flames]]
Rosier attended the subsequent [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|rally of Grindelwald's]] at the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]] as one of his acolytes. Vinda listened in on a conversation between [[Nagini]] and [[Credence Barebone]] about [[pure-blood]] hatred towards people like them, while leaning on a wall.<ref>{{COG|S|111}}</ref> She went onstage to give Grindelwald a [[Gellert Grindelwald's skull-hookah|skull hookah]] to show everyone [[vision]]s of the violence, warfare and bloodshed of the non-magical people, more specifically visions of the future [[Second World War]]. After a [[:en:Red-haired_young_witch|young witch with red hair]] was killed by [[Cassius Bell|an Auror]] after she tried to attack him, Grindelwald in response to the Aurors' opposition to him, [[Conjuration|conjured]] [[Protego Diabolica|a circle of protective fire around himself]] to test the loyalty of his followers; she stepped into the blue [[Fire|flames]] unaffected and unharmed, as she was truly loyal to him and his cause. 

[[File:Vinda disapparates.gif|250px|thumb|left|Vinda dissapparating away from the Lestrange Mausoleum]]
Whilst still holding Grindelwald's [[Gellert Grindelwald's skull-hookah|skull hookah]], [[Leta Lestrange]] destroyed it with a powerful [[spell]], which caused it to explode, knocking Rosier backwards. After that, she [[Apparition|disapparated]] away intending to spread Grindelwald's words and message to the wider [[wizarding world]], as all of his followers had been commanded to do.<ref name="COGS"/>

==Personality and traits==
{{Dialogue a-b-a|Rosier|When we’ve won, they’ll flee cities in the millions. They’ve had their time|Grindelwald|We don’t say such things out loud. We want only freedom. Freedom to be ourselves.|To annihilate non-wizards.|Vinda regarding her views on the [[Non-magic people|Non-magic community]]|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:Vinda talking with Queenie.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Vinda with Queenie Goldstein]]
Rosier was a mysteriously charming and ultimately malevolent witch, who was an avowed and loyal follower of the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Gellert Grindelwald]], and supported his [[vision]] of [[wizarding supremacy]] over [[Non-magic people|non-magical humans]] and their world. Vinda was outwardly courteous, sophisticated, and refined, and despite her deeply sinister ideology, could show kindness to those in need when it suited her to do so, as shown when she comforted and invited in a distraught [[Queenie Goldstein]] off the raining streets of [[Paris]], for [[tea]] in Grindelwald's abode. However, her motivation for doing this, would appear to be unknowingly place Queenie under Grindelwald's presence and influence, in the hope of recruiting new followers to his sinister cause.<ref name="COGS"/>

Indeed, despite her seeming benevolence and good will, Vinda was in reality a very ill-intentioned witch, who desired to see wizards and witches rise up above non-magical peoples and rule them, or alternatively exterminate them. This lack of concern for the non-magical was made evident when she, [[Carrow (1920s)|Carrow]], and the other [[Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes|Acolytes]] murdered the [[Non-magic people|Non-Magique]] couple who owned the home, which they used as a temporary hideout. Ultimately, unlike most other followers of Grindelwald, Vinda was loyal to Grindelwald's true vision, but was more extreme, and proudly stated that she wanted the extermination of all non-magical individuals.<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
[[File:Grindelwald Vinda Abernathy.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Vinda standing with Grindelwald]]
*'''[[Dark Arts]]''': Vinda at sometime in her education learned the Dark Arts, to the point where she was so well trained, she became the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s lieutenant.

*'''[[Apparition]]''': Vinda was fully capable of Apparating at will, as she managed to successfully Apparate out of the [[Lestrange Mausoleum|Lestrange family Mausoleum]], in order to spread the word of Grindelwald's cause and beliefs across the [[Wizarding world]].<ref name="COGS"/>

==Relationships==
===Gellert Grindelwald===
[[File:Grindelwald Headshot COG.jpg|140px|thumb|Her master, Gellert Grindelwald]]
Vinda was arguably [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s most trusted and loyal Acolyte, therefore being the Dark Wizard's anonymous lieutenant. Grindelwald trusted her with consoling Queenie Goldstein to soften her up for Grindelwald to convince her and also with keeping his [[Gellert Grindelwald's skull-hookah|Skull-Hookah]], displaying his deep trust for Vinda. When Vinda casually and proudly stated that Grindelwald's new order would bring the destruction of all [[Non-magic people]] and have them fleeing their cities in the millions, he told her they don't say such things out loud, but that they only want the freedom to be themselves and that they would not eliminate all muggles since the beast of burden would always be necessary.<ref name="COGS"/>

==Etymology==
*The name "Vinda" is a word of primarily Germanic/Norse origin that means "to wind; twist; wring."
*Rosier is, most notable, the name of a fallen angel (a Dominion of the Second Sphere) and patron demon of tainted love and seduction.
**In the Christian angelic hierarchy, Dominions regulate the duties of lower angels, and make themselves physically known to humans with extreme rarity.
**Rosier is also a French name that means "rose bush" or "from the rose bush."

==Behind the scenes==
*Vinda Rosier is portrayed by [[Poppy Corby-Tuech]] in the [[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald|second]] and [[Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore|third instalment]]s<ref>[https://www.instagram.com/p/CIDPPA6DqbV/ Poppy Corby-Tuech on Instagram: Back to wizarding business]</ref> of the ''[[Fantastic Beasts (film series)|Fantastic Beasts]]'' film series.<ref name="pm" />
*Her name is given only as "Rosier (female)" in {{COG|S}}, but her first name was revealed on {{PM}}.
*Vinda is similar to [[Bellatrix Lestrange]] because they both served as deputy to dark wizards (Vinda to [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] and Bellatrix to [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]). It is also possible that they're both related because the family name of Bellatrix's mother - [[Druella Black|Druella]] before the marriage was a [[Rosier family|Rosier]] like the family name of Vinda, and therefore Vinda could be a maternal relative of Bellatrix.
