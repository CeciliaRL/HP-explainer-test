'''Chadwick Boot''' (born c. [[1618]]) was an [[Ireland|Irish]]-[[United States of America|American]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and one of the four co-founders of [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. He was also the founder of [[Thunderbird (House)|Thunderbird house]]. Chadwick was the brother of [[Webster Boot]] and the husband of [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Healer]] [[Josefina Calderon]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>

Chadwick was particularly skilled in the area of [[charm]]s, and wrote a seven-volume book set, called ''[[Chadwick's Charms]]''. His book series was used at Ilvermorny long after his time, with the [[Calderon-Boot family]] becoming one of wizarding America's most prominent families.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Biography==

===Early life===
Chadwick was born around [[1618]] in [[Ireland]] to [[Boot brothers' father|Mr Boot]] and [[Boot brothers' mother|Mrs Boot]].<ref name="birth" /> He had a brother, [[Webster Boot|Webster]], who was younger by two years. As a child, he travelled with his family to the New World with the [[Plymouth settlement]] in search of adventure.<ref name="Pottermore" />

===Origins of Ilvermony School===
One day, they ventured into the forest where they were attacked by a [[Hidebehind]]. His parents were killed but he and his brother were saved by [[William (Pukwudgie)|William]], a [[pukwudgie]], and [[Isolt Sayre]] who nursed them back to health. They were eventually joined by [[James Steward]], a [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] who had travelled with the Plymouth settlement too and who had gone in search of the family when they did not return. Chadwick and his brother formed a bond with them both and even though James was scared of their magic at first, he eventually came round. James helped them build [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]] Cottage on [[Mount Greylock]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>

The four lived together at the cottage and Isolt and James were soon married. Isolt told them stories of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]. They both yearned to be able to return to Ireland so they could attend the school but Isolt would not explain why they could not. The brothers were instead promised [[wand]]s when they turned eleven and that they could make a [[Wizarding school|school]] of [[magic]] at Ilvermorny.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

This idea caught Chadwick and Webster's imaginations and they thought about how the school ought to be. It was to be based upon Hogwarts, and they wanted four houses but they thought naming the houses after themselves would sound ridiculous. They decided instead to name them after magical beasts, with Webster coming up with the house [[Wampus (House)|Wampus]], named after the [[Wampus cat|indigenous magical creature]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>

When Chadwick turned eleven, Isolt made good on her promise and she and James made Webster a wand made from [[prickly ash]] with a shard of horn from a [[Horned Serpent]] as the core. Webster and Chadwick were joined at the school by two other families, although theirs was the only one that lived at Ilvermorny.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

===1634===
By [[1634]], the school had grown and now included Inter-House competitions which was an idea given by Webster. Chadwick and his brother were also joined by Isolt and James' twin daughters, [[Martha Steward II|Martha]] and [[Rionach Steward]].<ref name="Pottermore" />

However, when Chadwick was sixteen, Isolt's wicked aunt, [[Gormlaith Gaunt]] discovered she was living at Ilvermorny. Gormlaith travelled there to make Isolt pay for leaving her and cast a [[Gormlaith Gaunt's curse|curse]] over her and James which put them in a deep sleep.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

Gormlaith did not know Chadwick and Webster were also staying at the house because she had never heard of them. Therefore, the spell she cast did not affect them. She also didn't know that they had powerful wands made with the horn of the river serpent. Gormlaith had cast another a spell in [[Parseltongue]] which made other wands become inactive, but these wands were not stopped by her spell and in fact, recognised the sound of the ancient language and emitted a low musical note to warn their masters they were in danger.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

This made Chadwick and Wesbter wake and leapt out of bed. As he had been having nightmares about the figure of an old witch creeping through the trees, Chadwick looked instinctively through the window and saw Gormlaith creeping towards the house. Even though Isolt had never spoke of Gormlaith to them, Chadwick had heard her talking of Gormlaith several times. Chadwick sent Webster to warn their parents while he ran to stop Gormlaith.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

Chadwick parried her curse expertly and they began to duel. Within a few minutes, Gormlaith, though far more powerful than Chadwick, was forced to concede that the talented boy had been well taught. Even as she sent curses at his head in an attempt to subdue him, and drove him back towards the house, she questioned him about his parentage for, she said, she would loathe to kill a pure-blood of his talent. Meanwhile, Webster was unable to wake their parents, so he joined Chadwick in his duel against Gormlaith.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

Gormlaith had underestimated them and the twin cores of the brothers' wands increased their power. However, Gormlaith's strong Dark magic was enough to match them. Gormlaith promised them mercy if they could prove their [[pure-blood]] credentials, but Chadwick and Webster were only determined to stop her reaching their family. The brothers were driven back inside Ilvermorny: walls cracked and windows shattered, but still Isolt and James slept, until the baby girls lying upstairs woke and screamed in fear.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

It was this that pierced the enchantment lying over Isolt and James. Isolt screamed at James to go to the girls as she ran to assist her adoptive sons, with [[Salazar Slytherin's wand]] in her hand. However, when she reached Gormlaith, she realised her wand was loyal to her aunt. Gormlaith drove Isolt, Chadwick and Webster backwards up the stairs, towards the place where she could hear her great-nieces crying. Finally she managed to get the doors open to their bedroom, where she was prepared to kill the family.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

However, Isolt cried out for her murdered father, William but instead she summoned [[William (Pukwudgie)|William]] the [[Pukwudgie]] who appeared on the windowsill and killed Gormlaith with a [[poison]]ed [[Pukwudgie arrow|arrow]], saving the family.<ref name="Pottermore" />

===Later life===
Chadwick later became an accomplished and well-travelled wizard who authored ''[[Chadwick's Charms]]'' Vols I – VII, which are standard texts at Ilvermorny. He married a Mexican [[Healer]] named [[Josefina Calderon]] and the [[Calderon-Boot family]] remains one of America's most prominent wizarding families today.<ref name="Pottermore" />

==Personality and traits==
Chadwick was described as intelligent yet temperamental.<ref name="Pottermore" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Duelling]]''': By the age of sixteen Chadwick was a very accomplished duellist with a talent for [[martial magic]], he was able to face the powerful [[Dark Wizard|dark witch]] [[Gormlaith Gaunt]] on even terms along with his brother, though this may have been due to their twin [[wand]] [[Wand core|cores]] increasing their power ten-fold against their foe.<ref name="Pottermore"/>
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Chadwick was highly proficient and knowledgeable in charm-work, as he authored [[Chadwick's Charms|a seven volume book set on the subject]].<ref name="Pottermore"/>
*'''[[Divination]] (possibly)''': Chadwick had [[Vision|dreams]] of a [[Gormlaith Gaunt|dark witch]] coming to Ilvermorny prior to Gormlaith Gaunt coming there,<ref name="Pottermore"/> suggesting he may have been a [[Seer]], given the accuracy of his prediction.
*'''Author''': Following his graduation from Ilvermorny, Chadwick's works became standard readings at his former school, covering multiple editions - a testament to his skills in both charms as well as his skills as an author.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Possessions==
*'''[[Chadwick Boot's wand|Wand]]''': Chadwick obtained his wand on his eleventh birthday by his adoptive parents. It was made of [[prickly ash]] with a [[Horned Serpent horn]] core.<ref name="Pottermore"/>

==Etymology==
*The name Chadwick originates from a surname which was derived from a place name meaning "dairy farm belonging to Chad" in Old English. The name Chad derivates from the Old English name ''Ceadda'' which is of unknown meaning, possibly based on Welsh ''cad'' "battle".

==Behind the scenes==
*Chadwick and his brother Webster are the youngest known founders of a wizarding school, as well as the only known founders to attend said school as students.
