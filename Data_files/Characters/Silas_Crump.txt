'''Silas Crump''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and petty criminal.<ref name="FBC61"/> 

==Biography==
During his life as a criminal, he had been evading capture by Officer [[Cerberus Langarm]] from the [[British Ministry of Magic]]'s [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]]. This was due to the fact that he had never been caught red-handed.<ref name="FBC61">{{FBC|6|1}}</ref>

Crump may have been in [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] as there was a Slytherin scarf in his rented room at the [[Leaky Cauldron]]. His cunning and resourceful personality would also seem to support this. There was also a [[Chudley Cannons]] flag in his room, so he was most likely a supporter of them.

He owned a [[Silas Crump's locked belt|locked belt]] which was found in the [[London sewers]]. He would use this to restrain himself during the full [[moon]] as he was an unregistered [[Werewolf]].<ref name="FBC64">{{FBC|6|4}}</ref><ref name="PM">Mentioned as an answer on [https://www.wizardingworld.com/quiz/how-well-do-you-know-remus-lupin The Ultimate Remus Lupin Quiz] from {{PM}}</ref>
