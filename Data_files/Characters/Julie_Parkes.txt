==Biography==
===Early life===
Julie Parkes was born in or before [[1982]],<ref name="age"/> presumably sometime in the late [[1970s]] or early [[1980s]].

===Education===
{{Quote|Thanks, Harry. I can't wait to play wizard chess!|Julie Parkes in the [[Clock Tower]].|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)}}By [[1993]], Julie was a Hogwarts student, [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Gryffindor]].<ref name="HBPvideo game"/> In the [[1996-1997 school year]] she asked [[Harry Potter]] to use a [[Summoning Charm]] to bring a jar of [[mandrake]]s down from a shelf she could not reach in the [[Herbology Store]]. Later that same term, she traded eight [[Wizard's Chess|chess pieces]] for sprigs of peppermint, another [[potion]] ingredient.<ref name="HBPvideo game"/>

===Death===
[[File:Parkes grave.png|200px|thumb|left|Julie's gravestone]]
Sometime between Summer and [[24 December|Christmas Eve]] in [[1997]], Parkes either died or was murdered (the latter being more likely given her young age — something between fourteen and eighteen — and because of the [[Second Wizarding War|war]]). She was buried in the local cemetery of [[Godric's Hollow]], next to the [[St Jerome's Church|Parish Church of St. Clementine]].<ref name="DHpart1videogame"/>
