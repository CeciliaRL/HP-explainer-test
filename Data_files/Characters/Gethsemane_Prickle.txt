{{Quote|I'm Gethsemane Prickle, Herbologist and Potioneer. Pay attention and you'll do fine.|Gethsemane Prickle|Fantastic Beasts: Cases from the Wizarding World}}
'''Gethsemane Prickle''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[wizardkind|witch]] and specialist in [[Herbology]] and [[Potion]]s who, in the course of her work for the [[British Ministry of Magic]], became Head of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]].<ref>{{WU}} (see [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-1-foundables-spell this])</ref> Gethsemane Prickle lived to be at least 61 years old.<ref name="FBC9-1">{{FBC|9|1}}</ref>

==Biography==
The scion of a family of unknown wizarding descent, Gethsemane Prickle was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]] and presumably attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] during her formative years, as is the case with nearly all magical children born in the wizarding community of Great Britain.<ref>“Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,” [Lupin] replied. “That was announced yesterday. It’s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred.”- Remus Lupin, [[Penelope Fawley|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]].</ref> In adulthood, Madam Prickle became an accomplished [[Herbologist]] and [[Potioneer]], and eventually, she found employment at the [[British Ministry of Magic]], where she was hired by the Ministry's [[Ministry of Magic research wing|research wing]] and was assigned to the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]]. She was not invited to join the [[Order of the Phoenix]] during the two uprisings of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], but she would later point out that even so; "there were other - and some might say better - ways to combat the Dark Lord," showing that she did indeed participate in the anti-Voldemort movement.<ref>{{WU}} (Brilliant Event: '''Stronger United''')</ref>

Later in her career, she would eventually find herself called in for consultation by the [[Beast Division]] more than once, and assist among others [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|her partner]] in solving investigations tied to creature-related incidents.<ref name="FBC9-12">{{FBC|9|1}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AiIdj3X6w1E Youtube - FANTASTIC BEASTS Cases From The Wizarding World iOS / Android Gameplay HD]</ref>

At some point prior to [[2006]], she learned that a woman by the name of [[Penelope Fawley|Penelope Padgett]] had joined the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] and sent a [[Interdepartmental memo|memo]] to the Head of the [[Auror Office]], [[Harry Potter]], and tried unsuccessfully to warn him about her, suspecting that she had ill-intentions, as her parents had been strong and outspoken supporters of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] during the [[Second Wizarding War]].<ref>[[Interdepartmental memo|https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/gethsemanes-warning]]</ref><ref>[[Auror Office|https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/penelopes-promotion]]
</ref> Having carried out her duties to the satisfaction of her superiors for a number of years, she was eventually promoted to [[Head of Department]] by [[2019]].<ref name=":1">https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/gethsemanes-warning</ref><ref>https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/penelopes-promotion
</ref>

After the Ministry of Magic became the Calamity World Centre in the wizarding world, she went on to help prepare members of the newly-created [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] who sought a career as [[Magizoologist]] prepare for the threat they would be facing. Apparently occupying a role of leadership, she he was in a position to demand that such individuals had to build an immunity to the [[Billywig sting|stings]] from a [[Billywig]] in order to "earn their stripes" and join the task force.<ref name=":0">{{WU}} ([https://wizardsunitehub.info/profession-skill/billywig-stings/ see video])</ref> She would later on task one of them with sorting out an infestation of [[Doxy|Doxies]] from the drapes somewhere at the [[British Ministry of Magic|Calamity World Centre]], which would improve their [[spell]]-casting to the point of making it easier to hit evasive foes.<ref name=":0" /> At some point, she would also advise at least one of the members of the aforementioned task force to live among [[Centaur]]s. While this went horribly wrong, it did help said individual in acquiring many important survival skills.<ref name=":0" />

==Physical appearance==
Gethsemane had medium length grey hair, white skin and green eyes with thin brown-rimmed glasses. She often wore a bright red beaded necklace with many brightly coloured bangles and rings on her arms and hands.

==Personality and traits==
While rather stern compared to associates such as [[Myra Curio]] and [[Sage Bragnam]], being often brief and to-the-point and impersonally addressing those around her by their surnames, Gethsemane nevertheless maintained a fairly courteous and very professional demeanour around her co-workers, and was even known to have exchanged the occasional quip with those she got well along well with, such as [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]],<ref name=":2">{{FBC}} (Case 2: The Smell of Fear)</ref><ref>{{FBC}} (Case 3: Out of the Woods)</ref> A straight-laced, conventional woman, she was known to have a strong dislike of aberrant developments during the course of her duties, such as when he passive-aggressively voiced her discontent to Grimblehawk and her [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|partner]] with being sent a "bag of bones" to examine, only letting it slide without rebuking them because the former Magizoologist complimented her intellect.<ref name=":2" /> Secure in her own judgement and never shy about letting her voice be heard, she did not allow [[Harry Potter]]'s celebrity status to colour her opinion, as seen by how openly critical she was of his decision to vouch for [[Penelope Fawley|Penelope Padgett]]'s promotion to the [[Auror Office]], given her parents' status as [[Death Eaters]].<ref name=":1" />

*'''[[Magizoology]]''': As a consultant to the [[Beast Division]], and later as the [[Head of Department|Head]] of the [[Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures]], Madam Prickle had a very high level of knowledge regarding [[magic]]al [[creature]]s, knowing how to classify them and the various laws regulating the ownership of such creatures.
