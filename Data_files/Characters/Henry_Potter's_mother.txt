'''Mrs Potter''' (née '''Fleamont''') was a [[wizardkind|witch]]. On her deathbed, she asked her son, [[Henry Potter|Henry]], to preserve her maiden name, which would otherwise die out with her, as she was apparently the last of [[Fleamont family|her line]]. He honoured her request by naming his son [[Fleamont Potter|Fleamont]].<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref>
