}}'''Cantankerus Nott''' (fl. [[1930s]]) was a [[wizardkind|wizard]] and a member of the [[pure-blood]] [[Nott family]]. He was widely believed to have been the one who penned the ''[[Pure-Blood Directory]]''. This book listed the "[[Sacred Twenty-Eight|twenty-eight truly pure-blood families]]", with "''the aim of helping such families maintain the purity of their bloodlines''". The book was also published anonymously in Britain in the early [[1930s]].<ref name="PM">{{PM|pure-blood}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*"Cantankerous" is a word meaning ill-tempered, surly, argumentative, and uncooperative.

==Behind the scenes==
*He was most likely related to [[Theodore Nott]] as well as his [[Nott|father]]. It is also possible that he was Theodore's father or grandfather.
*Some of the families presented in his apparent directory weren't as pure-blooded as he claimed, such as the [[Ollivander family]]. Also many pure-blooded families such as the [[Potter family|Potters]], the [[Crabbe family|Crabbes]] and the [[Goyle family|Goyles]] were not listed, in fact many pure-blood supremacists were angered by their lack of inclusion. Due to this, if he was the one behind the [[Pure-Blood Directory]], Cantankerus Nott seems to have been a highly biased individual.
