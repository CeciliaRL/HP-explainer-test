==Biography==
Percival Graves was presumably born prior to [[1886]], in the [[United States of America]]. Nothing is known about his family or background, and his [[blood status]] is unknown. In his youth, he most likely attended [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], the American [[wizarding school]], where he would have received his [[magic]]al education. He presumably was academically successful and achieved high school grades, as he became an [[Auror]], a career which requires rigorous [[Auror training|training]] and superior magical skills.

At some point in his adult life, Graves was employed by the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]], where he became an [[Auror]]. He was presumably excellent at his profession, as he was held in very high regard by all other MACUSA officials and employees. He eventually became the head of MACUSA's [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement (MACUSA)|Department of Magical Law Enforcement]], an extremely important position, where he would have overseen the upholding of [[Magical Law]] across the whole of the United States.

At some point prior to [[6 December]] [[1926]], his identity was assumed by the [[Dark Wizard]] 
[[Gellert Grindelwald]] using [[Human Transfiguration]].<ref>[http://www.jkrowling.com/welcome-to-my-new-website/ JKRowling.com - Welcome to my new website!]</ref> It is unknown if he was killed or kept in captivity during this time. Through Grindelwald's excellent impersonation of Graves, he allowed to assume his position in MACUSA with significant power and authority in both MACUSA and the American wizarding community, and allowed him to unleash the Obscurus of [[Credence Barebone]], which [[Obscurial attack on New York|attacked]] [[New York|New York City]], in an attempt to expose [[Wizardkind]] to the [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] population. Whilst doing his evil work, he also wrongfully [[Capital punishment|sentenced]] to [[Death potion|death]] both [[Newton Scamander]] and [[Porpentina Goldstein]], simply to cover his tracks and to them remove from his path. However, they both escaped, the Obscurial was stopped by Aurors from MACUSA and Grindelwald's impersonation of Graves was finally [[Revelio Charm|exposed]] by Scamander. Afterwards, it is unknown if MACUSA ever managed to find the real Graves, dead or alive.<ref name="FB">{{FB|S}}</ref>

In the [[2010s]], the [[Calamity]] had a [[memory]] of Percival Graves appear in a public area inhabited by [[Non-magic people|Muggles]], paired with a [[Confoundable]] in the shape of a [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] [[executioner]] attempting to [[Memory extraction spell|extract his memories]]. The [[Statute of Secrecy Task Force]] successfully banished the Confoundable, returning the memory of Graves to [[Woolworth Building|its proper place]].<ref name="WU">{{WU}} ([https://youtu.be/7ltzmuLXWQA?t=581 see video])</ref>

==Physical appearance==
When [[Gellert Grindelwald]] transfigured himself into Percival in December 1926, he was described as an early middle-aged, good-looking man, wearing elegant clothes.<ref name="FBS5">{{FB|S|5}}</ref> 

==Personality and traits==
As the [[Director of Magical Security]], tasked with the protection of the American wizarding community, Percival Graves was likely highly professional and responsible, with [[Seraphina Picquery|President Picquery]] trusting him as her right-hand man. While [[Gellert Grindelwald]] impersonated Graves, he displayed a prim, serious, and ambitious personality, without arousing anyone's suspicions, implying that this was in line with the real Graves's personality.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': As an esteemed and influential Auror of the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America]], Graves would have been a highly accomplished and skilful wizard who was proficient in many different branches of magic. Given how [[Gellert Grindelwald]] was able to successfully impersonate him when displaying his own exceptional magical skills, it is likely that Graves was proficient to a similar level in many fields. 
*'''[[Auror]] skills''': Given his senior positions within the MACUSA Law Enforcement hierarchy and even the fact he seemed to earn the confidence of [[President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America|President]] [[Seraphina Picquery]], Graves was evidently an Auror of superb ability. Given how Aurors are particularly proficient with [[Martial magic]] and [[Duelling]], along with [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]], [[Charm]]s, [[Transfiguration]], [[Herbology]] and [[Potion]]s, it can be assumed that Graves would have been excellent in all these different fields of required Auror skills and training. 

==Possessions==
[[File:Percival Graves wand.png|156x156px|right|Percival's wand]]
*'''[[Percival Graves's wand|Wand]]''': Percival owned a [[wand]], which was of an unknown length, [[wand wood]] and [[wand core]]. This wand was presumably manufactured by an American [[Wandmaker]].
*'''[[Percival Graves' polyjuice flask|Polyjuice flask]]''': Used for holding [[Polyjuice Potion]]. However, this is just speculation.
*'''Collar pins''': These were shaped as [[scorpion]]s and inlaid with green jewels.

==Etymology==
In French, the name ''Percival'' means "valley piercer; piercer of the valley; one who attacks through the valley". In Greek, the name means "destroyer" and is related to ''Perseus'', a hero of Greek mythology considered the greatest Greek hero and slayer of monsters before Heracles.

''Percival'' is also the name of one of the Knights of the Round Table in Arthurian legend and who was the original hero in the quest for the Holy Grail before being replaced in later literature by Galahad (a name and origin he shares with [[Percy Weasley]]).

The surname ''Graves'' is of both English/Anglo-Saxon and French origin. In Anglo-Saxon terms, it is derived from the baptismal name ''Reeve'' (which itself means "representative; herd; monger; maker; hewer; smith; wright") and means "son of Reeve". As an occupational name, it means "manager" or "overseer." In French, the name originates from an old family of the southern region of Languedoc, but could also derive from the Old French word "grave", which meant "gravel." It also refers to a place where dead remains (typically human) are buried, referring to death.

Percival Graves' name is almost identical to that of Richard Perceval Graves, an English biographer, poet, and lecturer best known for his three-volume biography of his uncle Robert Graves, who was responsible for the modern (but false) concept of the Celtic Tree Calendar (on which wandlore is based).

*Gellert Grindelwald transfigured as Percival Graves is portrayed in {{FB|FA}} by [[Colin Farrell]].<ref name="blog.peopleschoice">"[http://http://blog.peopleschoice.com/2015/08/05/colin-farrell-fantastic-beasts-harry-potter/ Colin Farrell Joins ‘Harry Potter’ Spinoff ‘Fantastic Beasts’]" at Blog.peopleschoice.com/</ref>
*Graves' story is highly similar to that of [[Alastor Moody]] during {{GOF}}, though Moody was ultimately rescued and it is unclear if Graves was already killed. Conversely however, [[Bartemius Crouch Junior]] impersonated Moody through using [[Polyjuice Potion]], whereas Grindelwald used [[Human Transfiguration]]. 
*The [[1991]] comedy film ''{{Wplink|King Ralph}}'' featured another character with the same name, Lord Percival Graves. Lord Graves was portrayed by [[John Hurt]], who also appeared in the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] as [[Garrick Ollivander]].
*It is unknown whether Grindelwald murdered Graves to assume his identity or imprisoned him in an undisclosed location.
