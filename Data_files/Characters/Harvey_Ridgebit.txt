He also established the world's largest [[Romanian Dragon Sanctuary|dragon sanctuary]] in [[Romania]], where [[Charles Weasley|Charlie Weasley]] worked and where [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s dragon, [[Norberta]] (a.k.a. Norbert) was eventually sent to live.<ref name="JKRS">{{JKRS}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Harvey" comes from the Breton given name Haerviu, which meant "battle worthy", from haer, "battle" and viu, "worthy". This was the name of a 6th-century Breton hermit, who is the patron saint of the blind. It was introduced to England by settlers from Brittany after the Norman conquest. During the later Middle Ages it became rare, but it was revived in the 19th century.
