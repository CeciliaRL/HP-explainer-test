{{Quote|Little did he know that the students playing Amata and Sir Luckless had been boyfriend and girlfriend until one hour before the curtain rose, at which point 'Sir Luckless' transferred his affections to 'Asha'.|[[Albus Dumbledore]]|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}

This '''girl''' attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the early part of the [[20th century]].

==Biography==
She was cast as [[Asha]] in the [[Christmas]] production of "''[[The Fountain of Fair Fortune]]''" that [[Herbert Beery]] arranged. An hour before the play started, the [[Boy who played Sir Luckless|boy]] who played [[Sir Luckless]] dumped his [[Girl who played Amata|girlfriend]] (who had been cast as [[Amata]]) in favour of the one playing Asha, causing the two jealous young witches to [[Duelling|duel]] each other on the stage. [[Professor]] Beery was caught in the crossfire, and was unable to stop them or prevent the [[Engorgement Charm|engorged]] [[ashwinder]], serving as the [[gigantic white worm]], from setting fire to the [[Great Hall]].<ref>{{TBB|F}}</ref>
