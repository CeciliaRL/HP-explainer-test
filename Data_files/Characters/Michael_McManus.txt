'''Michael McManus''' was a [[Beater]] on the [[Hufflepuff]] [[Quidditch]] [[Hufflepuff Quidditch team|team]] in the [[1993–1994 school year]].<ref name="thestage">[http://web.archive.org/web/20080708220442/http://www.thestage.co.uk/connect/focus/barnshaw.php Interview with Lewis Barnshaw in ''The Stage'']</ref> He played in the match between [[Gryffindor]] and [[Hufflepuff]].

==Etymology==
The name "Michael" comes from the Hebrew name מִיכָאֵל (Mikha'el) meaning "who is like God?". This is a rhetorical question, implying no person is like God. Saint Michael was one of the seven archangels in Hebrew tradition and the only one identified as an archangel in the Bible.

==Behind the scenes==
*This character only appears in {{POA|FA}}. Portrayed by [[Lewis Barnshaw]], he is seen briefly, during the match between [[Gryffindor]] and [[Hufflepuff]]. His name is not given in the film, but was revealed in an interview with Lewis in ''[[Wikipedia:The Stage|The Stage]]'', a [[Great Britain|British]] theatre magazine.<ref name="thestage" />
*Michael's presence as a [[Beater]] on the Hufflepuff team while it was captained by [[Cedric Diggory]] conflicts with the player roster from the video game {{QWC}}. In this game, Hufflepuff's Beaters are [[Anthony Rickett]] and [[Maxine O'Flaherty]], but it is possible that Michael was a reserve team member, who played in the Gryffindor-Hufflepuff match only because Anthony or Maxine was unable to do so. Alternatively, Anthony and/or Maxine may have been on the team in the [[1992–1993 school year]], but not during the following term. However, Cedric Diggory is not known to have been captain before 1993-1994.
