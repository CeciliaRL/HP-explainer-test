This '''unidentified Swedish Short-Snout''' was the female [[dragon]] that [[Cedric Diggory]] had to get by in the [[Triwizard Tournament|First Task]] of the [[1994]] [[Triwizard Tournament]]. 

He [[Transfiguration|Transfigured]] a [[Rock to dog spell|rock into a dog]] to distract the dragon and allow him to retrieve the [[golden egg]] that it was guarding. Unfortunately the dragon changed its mind partway through Diggory's attempt and attacked. He escaped with the egg but was burned by dragon fire and needed to be healed by [[Poppy Pomfrey|Madam Pomfrey]] in the [[Hospital Wing]].<ref name="GOF20">{{GOF|B|20}}</ref>
