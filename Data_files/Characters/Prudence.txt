'''Prudence '''(fl. [[1260s|1269]]), nicknamed '''Pru''' by her sister, was a [[Scotland|Scot]] who lived in [[Aberdeen]], [[Scotland]] during the [[13th century]]. She was the sister of [[Modesty Rabnott]], who she had received a [[Modesty Rabnott's letter to Prudence|letter from]] after she lost her home.<ref name="QTA4">{{QTA|R|4}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible her surname is "Rabnott" since this was her sister's surname and there was no mention of Modesty having a husband come with her. It is possible, however, that Prudence was married.
*In 1269, the [[International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy|Statute of Secrecy]] did not exist, meaning that it is possible for Prudence to be a Muggle who knows about magic.
