'''Borf''' was a male [[werewolf]] offspring of the [[Forbidden Forest wolf pack]].

==Biography==
As a member of the Forbidden Forest pack, Borf was descended from two werewolves who mated while in wolf form during a full [[moon]], an extremely rare occurrence. Unlike humans affected with [[Lycanthropy]], such wolves do not transform and are not any more savage than standard wolves while being extremely intelligent and beautiful.

One day, Borf followed [[Chiara Lobosca]] out of the [[Forbidden Forest]]. He continued to live in the forest, but frequently visited Chiara, whom he had befriended. The cub was named Borf as that was what the sound he made sounded like.<ref name="Hallowe'en">{{HM|1|Howling Hallowe'en}}</ref>

When a worker of the [[Werewolf Capture Unit]], [[Cecil Lee]] came to investigate Hogwarts following a werewolf attack, Chiara and [[Rubeus Hagrid]] showed Borf as an example of a non-violent werewolf. [[Jacob's sibling]], who was also there, was confused.<ref name="Hallowe'en"/>

Later, in the [[1988–1989 school year]], Jacob's sibling and [[Rowan Khanna]] came to to the Forbidden Forest to play with Borf in order to help Rowan calm down before their [[Ordinary Wizarding Level|O.W.L.s]].<ref name="HM5 OWL">{{HM|5|Ordinary Wizarding Levels}}</ref>
