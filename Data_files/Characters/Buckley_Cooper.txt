{{Quote|Dear Problem Page, I have been having a feud with my brother for many years now, which last week culminated in him sending me a broomstick which has been cursed to whack me around the shins every time I attempt to remove it from the house. Would the Ministry of Magic turn a blind eye if I kidnapped my brotherâ€™s children and turned them into blood-sucking ferrets? Yours sincerely, Buckley Cooper.|Buckley Cooper's question to the Problem Page of the Daily Prophet.|Daily Prophet Newsletters}}

In his reply, [[Dempster Wiggleswade]] warned Cooper not to go through with these actions.<ref name="DP" />
