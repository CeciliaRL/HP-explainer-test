'''Yann Fredericks''' (born [[2006|2005]] or [[2007|2006]]) was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and [[Gryffindor]] student in [[Albus Potter]]'s year at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

==Biography==
===Early life===
Yann Fredericks was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|United Kingdom]] between [[1 September]] [[2006|2005]] and [[31 August]] [[2007|2006]].<ref name="act1scene4">{{CC|B|1|4}}</ref>

===First year===
Yann began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] on 1 September [[2017]] and was sorted into [[Gryffindor]].<ref name="act1scene4" /><ref name="act2scene11">{{CC|B|2|11}}</ref> During the [[sorting ceremony]], he remarked that [[Albus Potter]] had hair just like his father, [[Harry Potter]].<ref name="act1scene4" /> He sardonically retracted this comment when Albus was placed in [[Slytherin]] a short time later.<ref name="act1scene4" />

Yann was able to raise his [[broomstick]] on the first attempt during the [[first year]]s' initial [[Flying (class)|flying]] lesson with [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Hooch]].<ref name="act1scene4" /> The only other student in the class who accomplished this feat was [[Rose Granger-Weasley]].<ref name="act1scene4" />

===Fourth year===
Upon returning to [[2020]] after [[Time-Turner|altering the past]], Albus Potter and [[Scorpius Malfoy]] found themselves in an [[alternate reality]], in which Albus was a Gryffindor and [[Hermione Granger]] taught [[Defence Against the Dark Arts]].<ref name="act2scene11" /> During a lesson, Albus questioned her about the changed circumstances, prompting her to deduct points from Gryffindor.<ref name="act2scene11" /> Albus persisted, however, prompting Yann to threateningly insinuate that he would do something to Albus if he didn't stop.<ref name="act2scene11" />

After finding himself in another alternate reality, in which [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] won and Albus was never born, Scorpius was greeted by Yann and [[Karl Jenkins]] in the Hogwarts grounds.<ref name="act3scene2">{{CC|B|3|2}}</ref> Yann asked Scorpius if he was still on for an event the following night and Karl enthused they were both ready to "spill some proper [[Muggle-born|Mudblood]] guts."<ref name="act3scene2" />

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Flight|Flying]]''': Judging by his performance in his first [[Flying (class)|Flying]] lesson at Hogwarts, Yann appeared to be a skilled [[broomstick]] flier, as he was able to successfully raise his broomstick on his first attempt, which was quite an impressive achievement for a [[first year]].<ref name="act1scene4"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{CC|P1}}, Yann was played by [[Jenet Le Lacheur]], then known as James.
