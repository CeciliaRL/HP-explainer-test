'''Trevor Birch''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]], who was a member of [[Ravenclaw]] house.<ref name="HBPG"/>
==Biography==
In [[1996]], he became a member of the [[Duelling Club]], and hoped [[Trevor Birch's mother|his mother]] would give him a [[broomstick]] for [[Christmas]]. He could usually be found at the [[Clock Tower Courtyard]]. Unlike most people who thought that [[Horace Slughorn]] was a stakeholder, Trevor thought that he was a good teacher. One day he was duelling and beat him. The blow was so powerful that he needed two days recovering in the hospital wing. He was also an admirer of the author [[Gilderoy Lockhart]].<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Trevor" is from a surname which was originally from a place name meaning "big village" from Welsh ''tref'' "village" and ''mawr'' "large".
