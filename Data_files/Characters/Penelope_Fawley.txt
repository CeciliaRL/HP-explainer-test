In 2015<ref>''Wizards Unite'', set in 2018, states Penelope has been missing for "three years"''<nowiki/>''</ref>, she went missing and the subsequent investigation overseen by the council of which [[Gareth Greengrass]] was a member, was called off.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Penelope Padgett was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]] into the wizarding [[Padgett family]] around [[1982]].<ref name="birth">When talking about Grim and Penelope in ''Wizards Unite'', Constance says that Penelope was "a few years" older than Grim. Grim was born in late 1984 or early to mid 1985.</ref>

She began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] sometime in the early-to-mid [[1990s]] and was sorted into [[Slytherin]]. In her [[fifth year]], she became a [[prefect]].<ref name="WU" />

During the [[Second Wizarding War]], her parents were both outspoken supporters of [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] and his [[Magic is Might]] Campaign; following the war, her mother was imprisoned in [[Azkaban]] for involving herself in the conflict. Before she was imprisoned, the last thing her mother gave her was a [[Comet 290]] [[broomstick]], which Penelope regarded as the only thing she had left to remember her by.<ref name="WU" />

===Career and marriage===
After her graduation, Penelope joined the [[Department of Magical Law Enforcement]] at the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="WU" /> She was described as being ambitious, a characteristic trait amongst Slytherins.<ref name="GF background">{{WU}} (see [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-2-grim-fawley-background this])</ref> However, people were suspicious of her due to her parents' past support of Lord Voldemort. In particular, [[Gethsemane Prickle]] sent a [[Interdepartmental memo|memo]] to [[Harry Potter]], the Head of the [[Auror Office]], warning him about Penelope and predicting that she was going to be trouble.<ref name="WU" />

Penelope was given a desk job that left her in frequent contact with Grim Fawley, a research assistant in the department. Eventually, the two fell in [[love]] and started dating in [[2005]]. Fearing that discovery of their workplace romance would result in Grim being transferred out of the department, the two decided to keep their relationship secret.<ref name="GF background" /><ref name="GF ministry record">{{WU}} (see [https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/guide/mysteries-chapter-2-ministry-record-grim-fawley this])</ref> As a result, the two would often communicate using coded messages.<ref name="WU" />

Penelope excelled in her work and her accomplishments within the Department resulted in her becoming an [[Auror]] within two years of having joined the department. She was described by Harry Potter as "one of the finest candidates" he had ever seen. During her career, Penelope was noted to not have been a rule follower, instead preferring to do things her own way. However, this view was common among Aurors and her work was otherwise considered outstanding. She was also noted for being very secretive.<ref name="WU" />

Penelope became friends with Harry and the two frequently talked about [[quidditch]] in the office, with her in particular being a huge fan of the [[Pride of Portree]]. During field work, Penelope favoured travelling with her broom instead of [[Apparition|Apparating]], which she attributed to her motion sickness.<ref name="WU" />

Eventually, after having dated for a year, Penelope and Grim revealed their relationship. Although it was considered a bit scandalous, it was ultimately permitted. The two got [[Marriage|married]] in [[June]], [[2006]], on a Sunday in West Bromwich.<ref name="GF background" /> At some point over the next nine years, before Penelope's disappearance in 2015, she and Grim would have twins<ref>In ''Wizards Unite'', Constance says "and ''then'' they had two children", with the phrasing implying they're twins.</ref> Addison<ref name="son">{{See image|File:Talbot to Addison.jpeg}}</ref> and Melody<ref>[https://wizardsunite.gamepress.gg/foundable/grims-grief A part of Grim’s journal reveals the names of his two children.]</ref>; Melody would inherit Penelope’s nose and, despite her words to the contrary, Addison would inherit Penelope’s stubbornness.
