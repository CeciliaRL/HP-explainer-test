'''Mr Khanna''' was the father of [[Rowan Khanna]]. The [[Khanna family]] ran a [[Khanna Farms|tree farm]] that supplied wood for [[wand]]s and [[broomstick]]s. Because of this, Mr Khanna and his wife advised their child, Rowan, against learning the [[Fire-Making Spell]] before attending Hogwarts.<ref name="HMy2ch8">{{HM|2|8}}</ref>
