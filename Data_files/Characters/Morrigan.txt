'''Morrigan''' was a famous [[Ireland|Irish]] [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]], notable for being an [[Animagus]] who could turn into a [[crow]].<ref name="Pottermore">{{PM|ilvermorny}}</ref> It is unknown whether or not she was a registered [[Animagus]].

Morrigan was an ancestor of [[William Sayre]], who nicknamed his daughter, [[Isolt Sayre|Isolt]], "Morrigan" due to her affinity for all things natural when she was young.<ref name="Pottermore" />
