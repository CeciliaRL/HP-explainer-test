Mary Lou was marked by a profound belief in the existence of [[magic]] and an equally deep hatred of it. She was the leader of the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]], also known as the Second Salemers, an extremist group whose goal was to expose and eradicate [[wizardkind|witchcraft]] in the United States.<ref name="pottermore-everything" /><ref name="snitchseeker1" /><ref name="entertainmentweekly2">[http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-characters/2368608_samantha-morton-mary-lou 'Fantastic Beasts' Character Descriptions Revealed - Mary Lou]</ref> She had three adopted children:<ref name="EW2016-08-10" /> [[Chastity Barebone|Chastity]], [[Modesty Barebone|Modesty]], and [[Credence Barebone|Credence]].<ref name="EW2016-08-10" /><ref name="entertainmentweekly1">[http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-characters/2368598_ezra-miller-credence 'Fantastic Beasts' Character Descriptions Revealed - Credence]</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===

Mary Lou Barebone was born into the [[Barebone family]], which was a family that descended from one of the [[Scourers]] who evaded justice in the late 17th century by integrating into [[No-Maj]] society. The Barebones were infamous for their profound belief in [[magic]] and their equally deep hatred of it.<ref name="FBaWtFT" />

At some point, Mary Lou became the leader of the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]], an American No-Maj anti-witchcraft group located in [[New York]]. By December of [[1926]], Mary Lou had three adopted children, named [[Chastity Barebone|Chastity]], [[Credence Barebone|Credence]] and [[Modesty Barebone|Modesty]].<ref name="FBaWtFT" /> Credence was given to her by the half-[[human]]/[[House-elf|elf]] [[Irma Dugard]], who saw necessary to have Credence raised by Mary Lou, likely unaware of Mary Lou's disciplinary and abusive attitude.<ref name="FB:TCoG">{{COG|S}}</ref>

At some point before December of [[1926]], Mary Lou was magically assaulted by Auror [[Porpentina Goldstein]] because she was physically abusing Credence.<ref name="FBaWtFT" />

===December 1926===
{{Quote|Something is stalking our city! Reaping destruction and then disappearing without a trace!|Mary Lou regarding the bizarre happenings within New York| Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:MaryLouRally.png|250px|thumb|right|Mary Lou preaching to the public in a rally supporting the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society]]]]
On the steps of the [[Steen National Bank]] on [[6 December]] [[1926]], Mary Lou, along with her children, preached to the public in a rally supporting the New Salem Philanthropic Society. After she praised the marvellous man-made inventions of New York, she insisted that the public heed her warnings of the presence of a mysterious [[Obscurial|force]] that's wreaking havoc in the city, and she implored the audience to join the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society|Second Salemers]] in the fight against wizardkind. 

As part of her speech Mary Lou randomly chose a member of the crowd to attempt to gain support from and spoke directly to him asking, if he was a "seeker of truth". That spectator happened to [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], a wizard. Newt jokingly replied that he was  "more of a [[Chaser]], really," before he ran into the bank, confusing her.<ref name="FBaWtFT" />

[[Langdon Shaw]], a believer in magic, brought Mary Lou and her children to his father, [[Henry Shaw Senior]]'s, [[Shaw Tower|office]] in an attempt to garnish the support of his [[Shaw News|newspaper company]] and his elder son's reelection platform. The meeting escalated quickly as [[Henry Shaw Junior]] called her son [[Credence Barebone|Credence]] a freak. Understanding that the Shaw family was not going to support the Second Salemers, Mary Lou politely bid them a good-bye.<ref name="FBaWtFT" />

====Death====
{{Quote|As she moves, an almighty force explodes into her: A bestial, screeching, dark mass that consumes her. Her scream is bloodcurdling as the force throws her backward, striking a wooden beam, flinging her over the balcony. Mary Lou smashes down onto the floor of the main church, her body lifeless, her face bearing the same scars seen on the face of Senator Shaw.|Mary Lou is killed by Credence's [[Obscurus]]|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:Mary Lou Barebone dead.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Mary Lou's Barebone's corpse, with Obscurial marks on her face]] 
The next day, Mary Lou's son Credence found a seemingly real [[Modesty Barebone's wand|wand]] under her daughter Modesty's bed. As soon as the girl arrived to protest that it was just a toy, Mary Lou entered and was appalled to see what her son was holding. As [[Credence Barebone|Credence]] removed his belt so she could punish him, Mary Lou snapped the wand in half and [[Modesty Barebone|Modesty]] confessed saying the wand was hers. But Mary Lou assumed it was his. The belt suddenly flung out of Mary Lou's grasp, injuring her hand, and as she went to pick it back up again, it again magically flew away. After she turned to confront her children, Mary Lou was attacked by Credence's [[Obscurus]]. She was flung against the rafters of the chapel and fell dead with formidable marks covering her face.<ref name="FBaWtFT" />

===Legacy===
In [[1927]], while speaking to his allies about Credence, [[Gellert Grindelwald]] bitterly remarked that Mary Lou, the woman who raised Credence, was nearly the same one who destroyed him. Sometime afterwards, when Credence met Irma Dugard, she explained to him why she left him in Barebone's charge, reiterating that it was necessary.<ref name="FB:TCoG" />

==Physical appearance==
Mary Lou Barebone was described as a handsome mid-western woman who wore 1920s versions of [[Puritanism|Puritanical]] dresses.<ref>{{FB|S|7}}</ref> She had brown hair in a styled bob haircut with blue eyes. She always carried a charismatic and earnest disposition.<ref name="FBaWtFT" />

==Personality and traits==
Mary Lou Barebone was a fanatical bigot against the magical community, and would raise her adopted children to hate witchcraft. Her utter intolerance against them bordered on the pathological, as she regularly physically, verbally, and emotionally abused and tormented her adopted children out of paranoia that they too, were witches or wizards (in fact, one of her "children", Credence, actually ''was ''magical). Mary Lou was also a sadistic disciplinarian; the slightest infraction of her strict rules by her children would result in abuse.<ref name="EW2016-08-10" />

However, Mary Lou also knew how to speak to a crowd, where she presented herself as composed, well-spoken, and inquisitive in a friendly manner, such as when she calmly asked Newt Scamander for his opinion on the subject of witches living amongst New York City's people. She also showed an array of good mannerisms and an understanding of defeat as she displayed these qualities to [[Henry Shaw Junior]] when he decided not to support the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society|Second Salemers]].<ref name="FBaWtFT" />

==Behind the scenes==
*Mary Lou Barebone is portrayed by English actress [[Samantha Morton]] in {{FB|FA}}.<ref name="businesswire">"[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150817005158/en/Filming-Underway-%E2%80%9CFantastic-Beasts-Find-Them%E2%80%9D#.VdHvhpfMLo1 Filming Gets Underway on «Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them»]" at [http://www.businesswire.com/portal/site/home/ BusinessWire]</ref>
*Mary Lou seemed to be the [[Non-magic people|non-magical]] [[United States of America|American]] counterpart of [[Great Britain|British]] [[Pure-blood supremacy|pure-blood supremacists]] such as the [[Death Eaters]] or [[Dolores Umbridge]]. While [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]]'s followers and Umbridge felt that the [[Non-magic people|Muggle]]s as well as the [[Muggle-born]] wizards must be wiped out or separated from the [[Wizarding world]] or subjugated, Mary's ideology was the polar opposite because she felt that [[Wizardkind]] must be destroyed to save the world as a whole.
