==Biography==
===Lifetime===
At some point in his life, Professor Aragon became the [[Headmaster]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="Lego HP"/> He also seemed to have an interest in [[Care of Magical Creatures]], as he authored at least one title on the subject, ''[[Newts of Bognor]]''.<ref>{{HPLE|G}} {{see image|File:NewtsofBognor.jpg}}</ref>

===Post-mortem===
Professor Aragon died sometime before [[1943]].<ref name="DOD"/> There were portraits of the professor hung at the [[Grand Staircase]]<ref name="PA/g">{{POA|G}} - PC version</ref> and one at the [[Headmaster's office]]<ref name="Lego HP"/> in order to give advice to the current headmaster.

==Behind the scenes==
*The solo portrait of Aragon was based on a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/32/Joseph_Chamberlain_John_Singer_Sargent_1896.jpeg 1896 portrait of The Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain], by [[Wikipedia:John Singer Sargent|John Singer Sargent (1856–1925)]].<ref name="HPLE">{{HPLE}} - ''[[The Paintings of Hogwarts: Masterpieces from the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Sets]]''</ref>
*Aragon's portrait of him by himself only appears at the [[Headmaster's office]] in {{LEGO|Y1}}. In {{COS|F}} the portrait of [[Amrose Swott|Amberose Swott]] occupies that space, and in {{OOTP|F}} and {{HBP|F}} the portrait of [[Everard|Professor Everard]] is hung there.
*In {{MHP}}, Walter Aragon's name appears on the portrait in the Headmasters' Office depicting [[Chessmasters and Headmasters of Hogwarts|two headmasters playing chess]]. [[Brian Gagwilde]] is named as the other headmaster.
*His motto "''Mens sana in corpore sano''" is a Latin phrase quotation often translated as "A sound mind in a healthy body."<ref name="Wikimenssana">{{wikilink|Mens sana in corpore sano}}</ref>
