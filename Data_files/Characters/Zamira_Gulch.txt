'''Zamira Gulch''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] the author of ''[[Practical Household Magic]]''. She also wrote for the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'s'' advice column, giving readers who wrote in tips on how to solve common magical problems, while [[Grizel Hurtz]], [[Helbert Spleen]], and [[Dempster Wiggleswade]] fielded other topics. In one issue, she responded to a letter from [[Elveira Elkins]], who was having difficulty getting a [[Fixing Charm]] to work. Gulch concluded that Elkins let her mind wander too much when casting the spell and should probably just stick to using nails instead.<ref name="DP">[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[1 June]], [[1999]], Problem Page</ref>

==Etymology==
The name Zamira Gulch is likely a play on a character from the 1939 film ''The Wizard of Oz'', Almira Gulch (who, in the film, was dreamed as the Wicked Witch of the West by the film's protagonist, Dorothy).
