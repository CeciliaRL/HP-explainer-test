*From 'Denys' or 'Denis', the medieval French forms of 'Dionysius'. Saint Denis was a 3rd-century missionary to Gaul who was beheaded in Paris.

This name was common in France during the Middle Ages, and it was imported by the Normans to England. It is now regularly spelled Dennis in the English-speaking world.
*"Aldermaston" is a rural village, civil parish and electoral ward in Berkshire, South East [[England]].
