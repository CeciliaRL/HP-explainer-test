==Biography==
In her first year, she was taught [[Potions (class)|Potions]] by the [[Potions Master]], [[Professor]] [[Horace Slughorn]].

==Etymology==
The Welsh name "Alys" is probably directly rooted in the name ''Alice'', which is rooted in the Old German name ''Adelaide'' (or, directly, ''Adelheidis''), meaning, 'Nobility".
