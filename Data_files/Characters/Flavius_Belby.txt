'''Flavius Belby''' ([[1715]] - [[1791]]) was the only known [[Wizardkind|wizard]] to survive a [[Lethifold]] attack.<ref name="FBWFT" /> Through his quick thinking and bravery, he discovered the [[Patronus Charm|one way]] to successfully drive off a Lethifold in [[Papua New Guinea]] in [[1782]],<ref name="FBWFT" /> and was subsequently immortalised on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Flavius was born in [[1715]].<ref name="COSG" /> At some point in his life, he was elected the President of his local [[Flavius Belby's local Gobstones club|local Gobstones club]], a moment that he would always remember to be one of the happiest of his life.<ref name="FBWFT">{{FB|R}}</ref>

===Lethifold attack===
In [[1782]], aged 66 or 67, Belby was on holiday in [[Papua New Guinea]]. One night, when he was lying awake on his bed, a [[Lethifold]] entered his bedroom, sliding through the little space underneath the door. Belby was awake (which is unusual for a Lethifold attack), and as such, had an opportunity to defend himself. As the creature attempted to smother him, he grabbed his wand and attempted against the beast, but neither the [[Stunning Spell]] nor the [[Impediment Jinx]] had any effects on it. Belby struggled but the creature continued strangling him. Incapable of breathing, Belby was next to unconsciousness when, using his last ounce of strength, he recalled the memory of the day that he was elected president of his local [[Gobstones|Gobstones Club]], and produced a corporeal [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]] that drove the creature off.<ref name="FBWFT" />

Belby would later write about this near-death experience:<ref name="FBWFT" />

{{Quote|To my horror, the shadow began to creep up the bed, and I felt its slight weight upon me. It resembled nothing so much as a rippling black cape, the edges fluttering slightly as it slithered up the bed towards me. Paralysed with fear, I felt its clammy touch upon my chin...Desperately I mustered up my last reserve of energy. Pointing the wand away from myself into the deadly folds of the creature, summoning the memory of the day I had been voted President of the local Gobstones Club, I performed the Patronus Charm. Almost at once I felt fresh air upon my face. I looked up to see that deathly shadow being thrown into the air upon the horns of my Patronus. It flew across the room and slithered swiftly out of sight.|Belby's account of the Lethifold Attack|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (real)}}
Belby died less than a decade later, in [[1791]], but the attack and his miraculous survival was remembered for centuries after.<ref name="FBWFT" />

==Legacy==
Belby's account of the attack was recorded in the book {{FB}} under the entry "Dealing with the [[Lethifold]]".<ref name="FBWFT" />

For being the only known wizard to survive a [[Lethifold]] attack though a combination of not being completely asleep and the use of a [[Patronus Charm]], he appeared on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="COSG" />

==Magical skills and abilities==
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Belby was exceptionally skilled in charms to the point where he was able to cast a corporeal [[Patronus Charm]], which is immensely advanced [[magic]] on its own, but even more impressively, he was able to cast it flawlessly while being attacked and suffocated under a [[Lethifold]], and succeeded in becoming the first person to survive an attack from one.<ref name="FBWFT" />
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Belby was able to successfully and resourcefully cast some defensive spells, such as the [[Stunning Spell]] and the [[Impediment Jinx]], along with his mastery of the [[Patronus Charm]], meaning he was evidently competent with defensive magic.<ref name="FBWFT" />

==Etymology==
"Flavius" is a Roman family name which meant "golden" or "yellow-haired" from Latin ''flavus'' "yellow, golden". Flavius was the family name of the 1st-century Roman emperors Vespasian, Titus and Domitian.

==Behind the scenes==
*He may be some [[Belby family|relation]] to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] student [[Marcus Belby]] of [[Ravenclaw]] house and his uncle, the potioneer [[Damocles Belby]], best known for inventing the [[Wolfsbane Potion]]. But so far, this is unconfirmed.
