This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1910s]] who was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] in [[Gryffindor]] house.<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>

==Biography==
Sometime during the 1910s, whilst attending Hogwarts, she and her [[Unidentified Gryffindor girl 1 (1910's)|friend]] spitefully gossiped about [[Leta Lestrange]] about being an unwanted child and for the [[death]] of her [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|half-brother]], before she herself was hit with the [[dark charm]] ''[[Oscausi]]'' by Leta out of retaliation, sealing her mouth shut. Once she reported Leta Lestrange to [[Professor]] [[Minerva McGonagall]], once having her mouth opened by her, she began to speak nastily of Lestrange, but her mouth was quickly re-sealed by the no-nonsense teacher to shut her up properly.<ref name="COGS"/>
