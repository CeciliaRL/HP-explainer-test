Rowling confirmed [http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html "Peverell blood would run through many wizarding families"], that Iolanthe had at ''least'' one other female relative - whether this be a sister, aunt, cousin, daughter - on the Peverell side (or through the Potters) to spread the Peverell blood to a different family. It is also possible that Hardwin and Iolanthe had a child together.</ref>

'''Iolanthe Potter''' (née '''Peverell''')<ref name="Pottermore" /> was an [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the granddaughter of [[Ignotus Peverell]]. 

==Biography==
Described as "beautiful", she lived in [[Godric's Hollow]]. Due to the lack of male heirs, she, the eldest of her generation, inherited her [[Ignotus Peverell|grandfather]]'s [[Cloak of Invisibility]]. Upon her marriage to [[Hardwin Potter]], she explained that, in the tradition of the Peverell family, possession of the cloak was kept secret. Hardwin honoured her family's tradition, and, from then on, the cloak was passed to the eldest child of each new generation in the [[Potter family]].<ref name="Pottermore">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref>

[[Henry Potter]], a member of the [[Wizengamot]] from [[1913]] to [[1921]] and the great-grandfather of [[Harry Potter]], was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe.<ref name="Pottermore" />
