==Biography==
Hailing from a [[pure-blood]] family and happily married to the [[Senegal]]ese pure-blood [[Mustafa Kama]], Laurena was put under the [[Imperius Curse]] by [[Corvus Lestrange (IV)|Corvus Lestrange]] and forced to bear a daughter with him. Laurena died after giving birth to [[Leta Lestrange]].<ref name="s101"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*Laurena Kama is played by [[Isaura Barbé-Brown]] in {{COG}}.<ref>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3769549/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t65</ref>
*Though her marriage to Corvus was not directly stated, it is strongly implied by Yusuf's words that Corvus "remarried not three months after her death".<ref>{{COG|S|103}}</ref>
*Her second marriage can be seen as similar to that of [[Merope Riddle]] and [[Tom Riddle Senior|Tom Riddle Snr]]. Both Laurena and Riddle Senior were forced into marriage and did not rear the resultant children. Riddle Senior abandoned his son, [[Tom Riddle]], whereas Laurena died giving birth, possibly similar to Merope who died an hour after giving birth.
*It is also noteworthy that Corvus used the Imperius Curse as opposed to a love potion as to prevent any ill effects on his daughter.
