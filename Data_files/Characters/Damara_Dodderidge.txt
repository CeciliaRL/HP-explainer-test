==Personality and traits==
{{Quote|Ohhhh, I'm too hungry. If you could ask Giffard Abbott — he's the portrait at the bottom of the Grand Staircase — to send some food along, then maybe I could help. Nothing much, just some chops, and a leg of lamb, some chicken and beef and maybe some cakes as well. Not too much. I'm so hungry.|Damara Dodderidge.|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)}}Damara was known being always very hungry and tired. Many times she would ask fellow portrait Giffard Abbott for food.<ref name="OotP">{{OOTP|G}}</ref> Her portrait at [[Hogwarts Castle]] depicts her like so, but by [[1996]] she seemed to stop constantly daydreaming about food and complaining about her tiredness. She said to be hungry once at breakfast time, though. Also by this time, she seemed to have developed a crush on fellow portrait [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]], calling him "''dashing''".<ref name="HBP" />

==Etymology==
Damara is the Celtic goddess of fertility.

==Behind the scenes==
*Damara is voiced by [[Rachel Atkins]] in the fifth video game while in the sixth game she is voiced by [[Beth Chalmers]].
*Damara Dodderidge may have died sometime prior to [[1991]], as many portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle|Hogwarts]] depict deceased individuals.
*It is possible that Damara is related to [[Daisy Dodderidge]], the famed founder and first landlady of [[Leaky Cauldron|The Leaky Cauldron]].
*Considering that she is named for the Celtic goddess of fertility, it may be that Damara Dodderidge's hunger and tiredness simply resulted from being [[Pregnancy|pregnant]].
*Damara's portrait was based on a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Robert_Peake_-_Lady_Elizabeth_Pope_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg c. 1615 portrait of Lady Elizabeth Pope], by [[Wikipedia:Robert Peake the elder|Robert Peake the Elder (c. 1551–1619)]].
