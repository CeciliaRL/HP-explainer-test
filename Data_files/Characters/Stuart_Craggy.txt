==Etymology==
*The name "Stuart" is from an occupational surname originally belonging to a person who was a steward. It is ultimately derived from Old English ''stig'' "house" and ''weard'' "guard". As a given name, it arose in 19th-century Scotland in honour of the Stuart royal family, which produced several kings and queens of Scotland and Britain between the 14th and 18th centuries.
*"Craggy" is another term for rugged and uneven terrain.

==Behind the scenes==
*This individual's name is clearly a reference to [[Stuart Craig]], production designer for all the eight ''Harry Potter'' films.
