[[1568]]''", indicating the year in which it was painted, and "''Ætatis Suæ 36''", indicating his age at the time the portrait was made, as ''anno etatis suæ'' is [[Latin]] for "''in the year of his age''"''.''<ref name="HPLE" /><ref name="TMOHP" /><ref>{{Wikilink|List_of_Latin_phrases:_A|List of Latin Phrases: A}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Poderick Crookshank's portrait seems to have been based on a [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/03/Anthonis_Mor_024.jpg 1568 portrait] of [[wikipedia:Henry Lee of Ditchley|Henry Lee of Ditchley]] by [[Wikipedia:Antonis Mor|Antonis Mor]].
*At {{MHP}}, the portrait of Poderick Crookshank was erroneously put in a frame labelled "[[Google Flange|Sir Google Flange]]," but Crookshank was correctly identified in ''[[The Paintings of Hogwarts: Masterpieces from the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Sets]].
*Within the in-universe continuity, this individual may have been [[Crookshanks]]'s namesake, just like a [[Hedwig (wizard)|name from ''A History of Magic'']] was picked by [[Harry Potter]] as [[Hedwig|his owl]]'s name.
