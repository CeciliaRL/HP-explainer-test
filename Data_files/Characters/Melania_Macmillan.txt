'''Melania Black''' (née '''Macmillan''') (fl. 1925-1929) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] married to [[Arcturus Black III]]. The couple had two children, [[Lucretia Black|Lucretia]] and [[Orion Black]]. She was [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and [[Regulus Black]]'s paternal grandmother.<ref>''[[House of Black|Black Family tree]]''</ref>

==Etymology==
''Melania'' is the Italian, Spanish or Polish version of the name ''Melanie'', which is derived from the Greek ''melaina'', meaning "black, dark".<ref>[http://www.behindthename.com/name/melania Behind the Name: Melania]</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Melania is almost certainly related to [[Ernest Macmillan]], a [[Hufflepuff]] student in [[Harry Potter]]'s year who boasts that he can "trace [his] family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks." Considering the respective ages of Melania and Ernie, they are either cousins several times removed or Melania is the sister of Ernie's great-grandfather. If the latter, Melania could claim ''six ''generations of magical ancestors.
*Likewise, if [[Hufflepuff]] is considered the [[Macmillan family]]'s traditional house, she might have been [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] there unlike the majority of her [[House of Black|husband's family]] and her descendants.
*Melania is likely Scottish as Macmillan is a Scottish surname, though her family might have left the country before her birth.
*Given that [[Arcturus Black III]] wasn't disowned for marrying Melania Macmillan, this implies that the [[Macmillan family]] are in the eyes of the Black Family a "respectable" family, compared to the Weasleys.
