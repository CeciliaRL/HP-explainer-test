The [[House of Black|Black family tree]] establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both [[Orion Black|Orion]] and [[Walburga Black]], Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree as both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown.
