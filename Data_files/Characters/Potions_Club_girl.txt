{{Quote|Wow, you are good! No one else has brewed a [[Volubilis Potion]] that well before! You can definitely join the Potions Club.|This girl speaking to [[Harry Potter]]|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)}}

This '''girl''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Hufflepuff]] [[Wizardkind|student]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the late [[1990s]]. She had an interest in [[Potions (class)|potions]] and was leader of the [[Potions Club]] which she set up in the [[Herbology]] [[Hogwarts greenhouses|Greenhouses]]. In the [[1996–1997 school year]], she allowed [[Harry Potter]] access to the necessary equipment and ingredients to brew [[potion]]s for himself, [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] and [[Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name="HBPG">{{HBP|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
The girl came to be educated at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and was [[Sorting ceremony|sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]], with [[Pomona Sprout]], the [[Herbology]] [[Professor]], as her [[Head of House]]. She shared a dormitory with other girls in the [[Hufflepuff Basement]], located below ground level and near the [[Hogwarts kitchens]]. At some point, she set up the [[Potions Club]] in [[Professor]] [[Pomona Sprout|Sprout]]'s greenhouses, probably after asking permission, in order to help others get their [[Potions (class)|Potions]] homework done, as well as to help others brew potions.<ref name="HBPG"/>

===1996-1997===
In [[1996]], she continued as the leader of [[Potions Club]] with the new [[Potions Master]] being [[Professor]] [[Horace Slughorn|Horace E.F. Slughorn]]. This year, [[Harry Potter]] came to the [[Hufflepuff]] girl and asked if he could join the club in order to brew a [[Shrinking Solution]] to help him get [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginny Weasley]] to go with him to [[Hogsmeade]]. She told him that he must first prove that he is a good [[Potioneer]] and asked him to brew a [[Volubilis Potion]], which was also her favourite potion and could be used to change the drinker's voice, which she considered a waste. After he successfully made the potion, she accepted him into the [[Potions Club|Club]] and allowed him to brew a [[Shrinking Solution]] as well as the [[Wiggenweld Potion|Wiggenweld potion]] to help him on his trip with [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]].<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Physical appearance==
This girl had straight long brown hair, with white pale skin and brown eyes.<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Personality and traits==
This girl appeared to be a very pleasant and decent individual, as she gladly allowed Harry Potter to join the Potions club and use their equipment and ingredients to brew potions. She was very congratulatory towards Harry, after she was impressed with the high quality of his [[Volubilis Potion]], meaning she was likely very friendly and humble.<ref name="HBPG"/> 

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Being a member of the Hogwarts [[Potions Club]], she was very interested in and likely talented in the field of potion making. Given her membership in the Potions Club and her enthusiasm for potions, she could likely brew many potions herself successfully and likely did well in [[Potions (class)|Potions class]] as well.<ref name="HBPG"/>

==Behind the scenes==
*The identity of this girl is unknown but it is possible that she is [[Megan Jones]], a [[Hufflepuff]] girl who was in the same year as [[Harry Potter]] during their time at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]].
*Several other girls appear in [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|sixth video game]] with identical facial features and hair to this girl, but they are in one of the other three houses.
