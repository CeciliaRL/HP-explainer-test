The [[House of Black|Black family tree]] establishes Cedrella as a first cousin once removed of both [[Orion Black|Orion]] and [[Walburga Black]], Sirius's parents. Thus, any children she had would be their second cousins, and second cousins once removed of their sons Sirius and Regulus. Also, almost all of Sirius's relatives can be seen on the Black family tree as both his parents were born into the House of Black, making it unlikely that he could be related to Arthur in a way not shown.

'''Louis Weasley''' was the youngest child of [[William Weasley|Bill]] and [[Fleur Delacour|Fleur Weasley]] {{c|née [[Delacour family|Delacour]]}}. He had two elder sisters, [[Victoire Weasley|Victoire]] and [[Dominique Weasley]].<ref name=WFT>[http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article3105517.ece Times Online - The Unwritten Story of Harry's Friends and Their Children]</ref> It is most likely that he lived at [[Shell Cottage]] with his family.

==Behind the scenes==
*Louis is the only known male in [[canon]] with [[Veela]] blood.
*[[J. K. Rowling]]'s great-grandfather was also named Louis. It is unknown whether Louis Weasley is named in honour of him.

==Etymology==
The name "Louis" is the French form of Ludovicus, the Latinised form of Ludwig. From Old German ''hlod'' and ''wig'', meaning "fame" and "warrior". The king Clovis I (5th century) was the first Christian king in France. This was the name of eighteen kings of France, starting with Louis I, the son of Charlemagne (8th century), and including Louis IX (Saint Louis), who led two crusades, and Louis XIV (the 'Sun King'), who was the ruler of France during the height of its power, the builder of the Palace of Versailles, and the longest reigning monarch in the history of Europe.
