==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Gwf.PNG|thumb|left|The girl's portrait in {{LEGO|Y1}}]]
*This individual depicted may have died sometime prior to [[1991]], as many portraits hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] depict deceased individuals.
*In the film adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Philosopher's Stone]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', the girl with flowers was portrayed by [[Violet Columbus]]. She is the daughter of [[Chris Columbus]], the director of the first two films, the younger sister of [[Eleanor Columbus]] and [[Brendan Columbus]], who portrayed [[Susan Bones]] and a boy in study hall in [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]], respectively, and the older sister of [[Isabella Columbus]], who played a girl in [[Flourish and Blotts]] in ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]''.
*A similar portrait (''[[Shepherdess]]'') is seen in the video game adaptations of ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (video game)|Order of the Phoenix]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (video game)|Half-Blood Prince]]''.
*In {{LEGO|Y1}} the portrait also appears in [[Madam Malkin's]].
*In {{HM}}, a portrait appears in the [[East Towers]]. If the portrait is empty, the player can click it to free one free [[Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery#Energy|energy]].
*In {{MA}}, the portrait appears in the Grand Staircase. She's asked by the player and two of their friends if she has saw [[Ivy Warrington]], but she was worrying their [[Wand]]-light was going to peel her oils.
