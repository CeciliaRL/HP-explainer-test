==Biography==
===Early life===
Gabriel Truman was born sometime between [[1973]] and [[1976]], somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

===Hogwarts years===
{{Quote|I got into big trouble during my third year for duelling a Ravenclaw prefect who insisted that Bridget Wenlock had come from his house, not mine. I should have got a week of detentions, but Professor Sprout let me off with a warning and a box of coconut ice.|Gabriel Truman.|Pottermore}}He began attending [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] sometime between [[1985]] and [[1987]], where he was [[Sorting ceremony|Sorted]] into [[Hufflepuff|Hufflepuff House]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

In his [[third year]], he landed in trouble by getting into a [[Duelling|duel]] with a [[Unidentified Ravenclaw Prefect (II)|Ravenclaw prefect]] who argued that the famous [[Arithmancer]] [[Bridget Wenlock]] must have been in his own house, not Hufflepuff, as she was in fact. Gabriel felt he deserved a week's worth of detentions for his own actions, but [[Pomona Sprout|Professor Sprout]] went easy on him, sending him off with a warning and a box of [[Pink Coconut Ice|coconut ice]].<ref name="pottermore"/>

By the [[1991-1992 school year]], Gabriel had been made a [[prefect]] himself and, after the [[Start-of-Term Feast]] on [[1 September]], [[1991]], welcomed the [[Hufflepuff]] [[first year]]s as they arrived at [[Hufflepuff Basement]] with a short speech about the House traditions, symbols, characteristics, and famous past students.<ref name="pottermore"/>
