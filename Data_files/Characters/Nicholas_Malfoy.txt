}}'''Nicholas Malfoy''' (fl. c. [[1340s]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[England|English]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and a member of the [[Malfoy family]]. He is believed to have dispatched many [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] tenants under the guise of the [[Black Death]]. If this is true, he escaped censure by the [[Wizards' Council]], and thus was never punished for it.<ref name="PM">{{WW|the-malfoy-family}}</ref>

==Etymology==
*The name ''Nicholas ''is a Greek name meaning "victory of the people." This could refer to the fact that after Malfoy killed many a Muggle, he was never punished.
*The name ''Malfoy ''comes from the French ''mal foi'', meaning "bad faith." If Malfoy is anything like his descendants, then this name is fitting.

==Behind the scenes==
*In [[1992]], [[Harry Potter]], speaking about [[Draco Malfoy]], said, ''"Look at his family... The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin, he's always boasting about it"''.<ref name="COS9">{{COS|B|9}}</ref> This indicates that Nicholas was most likely a [[Slytherin]] if he attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], though it cannot be confirmed.
