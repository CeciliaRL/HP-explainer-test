{{Quote|I like [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo]]. He was the one who got us such good tickets for [[1994 Quidditch World Cup|the Cup]]. I did him a bit of a favor: His brother, Otto, got into a spot of trouble — a [[Lawn mower|lawnmower]] with unnatural powers — I smoothed the whole thing over.|[[Arthur Weasley]] on [[Ludovic Bagman|Ludo Bagman]]|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire}}
