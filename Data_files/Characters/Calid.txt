==Behind the scenes==
*This character is referenced in a block of text on the back cover of a prop book featured in {{DH|F1}}. The text in question was taken from an [[1889]] English translation of the [[French]] book ''Le livre des figures hiéroglyphiques'' (''The Book of Hieroglyphic Figures''), which was first published in [[1612]], and has been attributed to [[Nicolas Flamel]] (c. [[1330]] – [[1418]]).<ref>''[https://archive.org/stream/b24887092#page/18/mode/2up Nicholas Flammel: His Exposition of the Hieroglyphical Figures...]'' copy on the Internet Archive</ref><ref name="wiki1">"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolas_Flamel Nicolas Flamel]" on Wikipedia</ref>
*[[wikipedia:Calid|Calid]] is a legendary figure to whom [[alchemy|alchemical]] writings have been attributed. He has been associated with an actual historical figure, Khalid ibn Yazid (died [[First millennium A.D.|708 A.D.]]), an [[Wikipedia:Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[prince]] who took an interest in alchemy and helped to translate the existing body of alchemical literature into [[wikipedia:Arabic|Arabic]].<ref name="wiki2">"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calid Calid]" on Wikipedia</ref>
*As Calid was an alchemist, it is highly likely he was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], but this has not been confirmed in canon.
