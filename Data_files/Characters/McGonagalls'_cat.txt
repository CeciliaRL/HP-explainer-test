The '''McGonagalls' cat''' was a pet of the [[McGonagall family]]. [[Isobel Ross|Isobel McGonagall]] learned her daughter [[Minerva McGonagall|Minerva]] was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] when she started displaying small, but unmistakable, signs of magic, such as the cat doing the infant's bidding before she could even talk.<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|professor-mcgonagall}} (transcription available [http://forums.darklordpotter.net/showpost.php?s=4a2e751bddc00f9618a0b1bb6d9ce6fc&p=481284&postcount=443 here])</ref>

It is interesting to note that [[Minerva McGonagall]] had an affinity with cats since she was an infant; in her adulthood, both Minerva's [[Patronus Charm|Patronus]]<ref name="DH30">{{DH|B|30}}</ref> and [[Animagus]] form<ref name="PS1">{{PS|B|1}}</ref><ref name="POA6">{{POA|B|6}}</ref> was that of a cat.
