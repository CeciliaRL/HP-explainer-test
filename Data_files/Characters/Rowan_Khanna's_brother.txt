This '''individual''' was the brother of [[Rowan Khanna]]. He thought [[Christmas cracker]] jokes were terrible while Rowan thought they were funny. Rowan also mentioned getting Christmas presents for him.<ref name="HMC">{{HM}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible this individual is [[Ashok Khanna]], as he is in the correct age range to be Rowan's brother.
*In the Chinese versions of the game, he is stated to be Rowan's older brother, which would mean he was born in [[1972]] at the latest.
