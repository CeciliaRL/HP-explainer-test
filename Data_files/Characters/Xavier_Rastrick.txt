'''Xavier Rastrick''' (b. [[1750]], vanished in [[1836]]) was a lively [[wizardkind|wizard]] entertainer who is famous for unexpectedly vanishing during a performance in [[Painswick]] before the very eyes of his audience, never to be seen again.<ref name=":0">{{PS|G}}</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:XavierRastrick.png|200px|thumb|left|A younger Rastrick during one of his dance routines]]
Born in [[1750]], Xavier Rastrick became a performer in the early [[19th century|nineteenth century]]. By the [[1830s]], his exuberant personality attracted a relatively large audience to his shows.

In [[1836]], a crowd of three hundred [[wizardkind|witches and wizards]] gathered in the village of [[Painswick]] to watch one of his performances. The show, however, became infamous, as Rastrick unexpectedly vanished halfway through a tap-dance routine and was never seen or heard from again. He was subsequently declared dead, with his true fate unknown.

By the [[1990s]], Rastrick was featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]] for his mysterious disappearance.<ref name=":0" />

==Behind the scenes==
*The reason why Rastrick suddenly disappeared is completely unknown, let alone whether or not he truly [[vanishment|vanished]] into non-being. It might have been a case of [[vanishing sickness]]. Alternatively, Rastrick might have become [[un-born]] due to some time-travelling mishap (as his disappearance was before [[1899]], when the Ministry stopped conducting time-travelling experiments). 
*Based on the fact that his sudden and unexpected disappearance is similar to the recurring disappearances of [[Quidditch referee]]s, a similar situation may have happened, where an object in contact with Rastrick, such as his hat, was [[Portus|transformed into a Portkey]], whisking him away from the stage to somewhere else where he may have died or turned up far into the future.

==Etymology==
The name "Xavier" is derived from the Basque place name Etxaberri meaning "the new house". This was the surname of the Jesuit priest [[Wikipedia:Francis Xavier|Saint Francis Xavier]] (1506—1552). He was a missionary to India, Japan, China, and other areas in eastern Asia, and he is the patron saint of the Orient and missionaries. His surname has since been adopted as a given name in his honour, chiefly among Catholics.
