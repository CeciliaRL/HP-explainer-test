==Biography==
[[File:AbraxanScared.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The Abraxan scared of shadows]]
During the late [[1980s]], this [[Abraxan]] lived on the Grasslands in the [[Magical Creatures Reserve]], and [[Jacob's sibling]] would often bond with and feed this [[Abraxan]]. As a part of [[Rubeus Hagrid]]'s research on Abraxans, it was brought to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] grounds, but became afraid of its own shadows. Jacob's sibling and [[Penny Haywood]] soothed it and gave it a bucket of [[single-malt whiskey]]. They ended up finishing the research with Hagrid in the Reserve.<ref name="HA"/>
