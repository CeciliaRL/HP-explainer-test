'''Martha Steward''' (b. [[1600s]]) was a [[Squib]] and the elder twin daughter of [[Isolt Sayre]] and [[James Steward]]. Isolt and James were the founders of [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].

It was painful for Martha to grow up at Ilvermorny when she herself was unable to perform [[magic]]. She eventually married the non-magical [[Martha Steward II's husband|brother]] of a friend from the [[Pocomtuc]] tribe and lived henceforth as a [[No-Maj]].

==Biography==
Martha Steward was born in or around [[1634]] at [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]] in Massachusetts, arriving before her fraternal twin sister, [[Rionach Steward|Rionach]]. Her parents, [[Isolt Sayre]], a [[pure-blood]] [[wizardkind|witch]], and [[James Steward]], a [[Muggle|No-Maj]], were the founders of the school. She was named after her [[Martha Steward|paternal grandmother]]. She also had two adopted brothers: [[Chadwick Boot|Chadwick]] and [[Webster Boot]].

Martha was the only one in the family to be born a [[Squib]], and with no magic powers herself, she considered her upbringing at Ilvermorny painful. She was loved by her family regardless.

When she was a baby, her great-aunt, [[Gormlaith Gaunt]], attacked the family. Her parents had been put in to a deep sleep by Gormlaith, but the cries of Martha and her sister woke them. The family were saved by [[William (Pukwudgie)|William]], the [[Pukwudgie]] her mother had befriended several years earlier.

Martha went on to marry the [[Martha Steward II's husband|non-magical brother]] of a friend from the [[Pocomtuc]] tribe. She assimilated into her husband's community, living as a [[No-Maj]]. However, it is unknown whether Martha and her fraternal twin sister are the last of the Irish branch of the Gaunt family. Because Martha is the only one in the family who is married, she may have had children with her husband.

==Etymology==
*Martha comes from the Aramic ''marta ''meaning "the lady, mistress".

*The surname steward comes from Middle English ''steward'', from Old English ''stīweard'', ''stīġweard'' ‎meaning “steward, housekeeper, one who has the superintendence of household affairs, guardian”, from ''stīġ'' in the sense ''house'', ''hall'' + ''weard''  ‎“ward, guard, guardian, keeper”.

== Behind the scenes ==

* It is not known whether or not Martha had children; but if she still had descendants nowadays they most likely would be [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]], or [[Muggle-born|No-Maj born]], so ironically [[Salazar Slytherin]] may have had descendants who were in the two categories of people he hated most.
*[[Rionach Steward|Martha's sister]] chose not to marry because she didn't want the [[Slytherin family|Slytherin line]] to continue. It is possible that she did not want to impose this choice on Martha, or that she tried and failed.
**However, [[Martha Steward II's husband|Martha's husband]] did not have magical powers and the discovery that [[magic]] can awaken in the descendants of the [[squib]] is recent, so it is possible that Rionach did not oppose her sister's marriage.
