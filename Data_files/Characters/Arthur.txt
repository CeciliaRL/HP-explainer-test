==Biography==
Arthur ruled what is today [[Great Britain|Britain]] during the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="merlin" /> The [[Dark Wizard|Dark witch]] [[Morgan le Fay]] was his half-sister,<ref>[[Chocolate Frog Card|Famous Wizard Card]] (Morgan le Fay)</ref> but his [[Blood status|parentage]] is unknown,<ref>In traditional Arthurian legend, Arthur was fathered by [[wikipedia:Uther Pendragon|Uther Pendragon]], who had Merlin use magic to disguise him as his enemy, [[wikipedia:Gorlois|Gorlois]], in order to allow him to spend a night with Gorlois's wife, [[wikipedia:Igraine|Lady Igraine]]. However, Arthur's parentage has not been specified in any work in the [[Harry Potter series|''Harry Potter'' franchise]], and might differ from that found in Arthurian legend.</ref> as is whether he was a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] or not.

The great [[Wizardkind|wizard]] [[Merlin]] was a key member of [[Court of King Arthur|the Court of King Arthur]].<ref name="merlin" /> The [[Knights of the Round Table]] were also an important part of the Court, and included [[Lancelot (knight)|Sir Lancelot]], [[Bedivere|Sir Bedivere]] and [[Percivale|Sir Percivale]].<ref name="pottermore-cadogan" /> Wizards and witches commonly hold that this order included a wizard, [[Cadogan|Sir Cadogan]], who got the position by being a friend of Merlin.<ref name="pottermore-cadogan" /> Tellings of the story of King Arthur differed between the [[Muggle world|Muggle]] and [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] worlds, in that Sir Cadogan was included in wizarding versions, but absent in Muggle ones.<ref name="pottermore-cadogan" />

==Behind the scenes==
*[[Richard Harris]], who played [[Albus Dumbledore]] in the ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film)|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', played Arthur in the [[1967]] film ''[[wikipedia: Camelot (film)|Camelot]]''. Following his death in [[2002]] a statue of him in this role was erected in Bedford Row in the centre of his home town of [[Wikipedia:Limerick|Limerick]].
*[[Jamie Campbell Bower]], who played the teenage [[Gellert Grindelwald]] in {{DH|F1}}, played Arthur in the TV series ''[[wikipedia: Camelot (TV series)|Camelot]]''. [[Merlin]] was played by {{wplink|Joseph Fiennes}}, brother of [[Ralph Fiennes]] ([[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]]), and [[Morgan le Fay]] was played by former Bond girl {{wplink|Eva Green}}. ﻿
*King Arthur and [[Harry Potter]] can be seen as similar; both held swords in fights (Arthur Excalibur and Harry Gryffindor's sword), both had mentors ([[Merlin]] and [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]]) and both married women with a similar name (Guinevere and [[Ginevra Weasley|Ginevra]])
*[[J. K. Rowling]] said King Arthur from {{Wplink|T.H. White}}'s ''The Sword in The Stone'' is [[Harry Potter]]'s spiritual ancestor.
*Arthur's time of existence in the [[Harry Potter universe]] (like Merlin, Morgan le Fay etc) is paradoxical as the King Arthur of the Arthurian legends is said to have lived and reigned in the 5th or 6th century. As Merlin attended Hogwarts and was a part of King Arthur's Court and an advisor to him, then he, like the ''legendary ''version of Merlin predates Hogwarts by around 400/500 years.
