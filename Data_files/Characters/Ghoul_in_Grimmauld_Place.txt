{{Quote|Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help; Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet...|The [[Order of the Phoenix]] having discovered this ghoul at 12 Grimmauld Place|Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix}}
This '''[[ghoul]]''' was, at one point, living in one of [[12 Grimmauld Place]]'s bathrooms. Though most ghouls are simple-minded and peaceful, this one was described as "murderous" and was considerably more of a threat than normal. During their cleansing of the house in the summer of [[1995]], [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], [[Sirius Black]] and [[Weasley family|the Weasleys]] came across this ghoul. They managed to get rid of it with the assistance of [[Nymphadora Tonks]], who was visiting that day.<ref name="OOTP6">{{OOTP|B|6}}</ref>
