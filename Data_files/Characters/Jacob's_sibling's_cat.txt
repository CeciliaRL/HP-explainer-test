==Behind the scenes==
[[File:HogwartsMysteryCats.jpg|250px|thumb|left|The different available varieties of the cat]]
*Several cat varieties are available for purchase in the game. However, the player has to first purchase the cat with the default look before being able to select other varieties. This pet may be purchased before the quest begins, leading to some altered dialogue.
