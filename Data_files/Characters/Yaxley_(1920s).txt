==Biography==
{{Quote|Return, great avenger, with wings, from the water. Congratulations, Leta. Your brother lives. We all truly believe it.|Yaxley in Leta's ear|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald}}
[[File:Theseus shaking hands with Shafiq and Yaxley.png|250px|left|thumb|Yaxley with Shafiq, his wife, and Theseus]]
In [[1927]], Yaxley attended a wizarding ball and was busy socialising with [[Shafiq (1920s)|Shafiq]] when the pair was greeted by [[Theseus Scamander]]. Scamander embraced Shafiq and then shook hands with Yaxley as he introduced him to [[Yaxley's wife|his wife]]. Scamander's fiancée [[Leta Lestrange]] kept her distance from Yaxley as she disliked his behaviour of bee-lining towards her due to her [[blood status]] as a [[pure-blood]]. A short while later, as Leta was wandering the party alone, Yaxley came up to her and quoted from ''[[The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus]]'', expressing his belief that [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|her brother]] had indeed survived the sinking of the [[Unidentified ship|ship]].<ref name="COG">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE1rQCwjF_Y&t=219s Crimes of Grindelwald - Deleted Scenes]</ref>

Around a decade later, he and his kinsmen became proud members of the [[Sacred Twenty-Eight]] in the ''[[Pure-Blood Directory]]''.<ref name="PM">{{PM}}</ref>
