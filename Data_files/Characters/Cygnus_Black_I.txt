'''Cygnus Black''' ([[1829]]—[[1851]]) was a [[pure-blood]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]]. He was an early member of the [[House of Black]], and possibly the brother of [[Arcturus Black I|Arcturus]] and [[Misapinoa Black|Misapinoa]] and father of [[Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]] and his siblings ([[Sirius Black I|Sirius]], [[Elladora Black|Elladora]], and [[Iola Black|Iola]]), but his precise relationship to other known members of the Black family is unknown. He married [[Ella Max]].<ref>{{OOTP|F}} DVD (Disc 2 - menu opening sequence)</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This character appears only on the version of the Black family tree shown in {{OOTP|FA}}. He was not included on the version of the tree which [[J. K. Rowling]] gave to a charity auction in [[2006]].<ref>"[http://www.hplex.info/wizards/blackfamilytree.html Black Family Tree]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref> However, according to director [[David Yates]], Rowling provided the filmmakers with a copy of the Black family tree going back eight generations.<ref>"[http://web.archive.org/web/20071218224958/http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2007/5/24/empire-magazine-feature-on-ootp 'Empire' Magazine Feature on OotP]" from The Leaky Cauldron</ref> The filmmakers presumably received a more complete version of the tree than the one auctioned off, which only goes back six generations.
*Cygnus was probably the son of [[Licorus Black]].
*Given his placement on the tree in the film, this character may have been the older brother of [[Arcturus Black I|Arcturus I]], and the father of [[Sirius Black I|Sirius I]], [[Phineas Nigellus Black|Phineas Nigellus]], [[Elladora Black|Elladora]] (who would have been named after her mother Ella), and [[Iola Black|Iola]].
*If Iola was Cygnus' daughter, that means that he died before or after she was born, because she was born after 1850 and he died in 1851.
*Based on a statement of [[Horace Slughorn]], Cygnus may have been a member of [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. However, he attended Hogwarts c. [[1840]] - [[1847]], when Slughorn was not Potions teacher.
*If it is proven that Cygnus is the father of [[Phineas Nigellus Black]], then it can be said that the name Cygnus is, by tradition, skipped every other generation, or his descendants are named after him out of respect for him.
*Cygnus would have been quite young to have become a father (starting at 16 with Sirius I, 18 with Phineas, 21 with Elladora, and, 22 for Iola). J.K. Rowling has stated that Math was not her strong suit.

==Etymology==
Cygnus means "swan". A [[Cygnus Black II|possible grandson]] of Cygnus I is named after him. Cygnus is also the name of a constellation in the Northern Hemisphere near Lacerta and Lyra, containing the star Deneb. Also called Northern Cross and Swan.
