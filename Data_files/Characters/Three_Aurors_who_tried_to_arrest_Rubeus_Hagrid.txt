These '''three unidentified individuals''' (fl. [[1995]]) were [[Wizardkind|wizards]] and [[Auror]]s for the [[British Ministry of Magic]].<ref name="OP31"/>

==Biography==
===1995===
In [[June]] of [[1995]], these wizards came to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] along with [[John Dawlish]] and [[Dolores Umbridge]] in an attempt to forcibly remove [[Rubeus Hagrid]] from both his teaching position and his [[Hagrid's Hut|home]]. When he refused to leave, they attempted to stun him with several [[Stunning Spell]]s, but he managed to [[Spell resistance|resist]] their spells. Minerva McGonagall protested angrily against them for their excessive force, for which they retaliated by assaulting her with four stunning spells, resulting in her being hospitalised in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] for her injuries. Furious at such a cowardly attack, Hagrid attacked two of them in a blind rage, knocking them both unconscious before escaping, with the remaining one too frightened to approach the enraged Hagrid.<ref name="OP31">{{OOTP|B|31}}</ref>
