This '''[[Wizardkind|wizard]]''' taught Muggle Studies at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at least in the [[1992–1993 school year]].<ref name="year">"Harry refers to the teacher as a "he", so Burbage could not have been teaching during 1992, so she presumably began teaching in the [[1993–1994 school year]].</ref> In [[1992]], he had gained [[Male Muggle Studies teacher's student assistant|a student assistant]] to assist him and manage [[Muggle Studies Classroom|the classroom]] while he was absent.<ref name="COSG"/>

==Biography==
When [[Harry Potter]] was given a torch by a [[Non-magic people|Muggle]] student, he brought it to the professor's classroom, thinking it might be the right place for it. Instead of the teacher, he met his assistant and the torch was included in the artefact collection.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}} - {{C|GBC version}}</ref> He left at some point before the [[1996–1997 school year]], and was possibly replaced by [[Professor]] [[Charity Burbage]].

==Behind the scenes==
*It is possible that this individual was [[Arif Sikander]], as a [[Unidentified Hogwarts employees#Attendant with a moustache and goatee|teacher]] that went unidentified in {{PS|FA}} whose likeness Sikander was possibly based on made an appearance as a non-speaking background character.
