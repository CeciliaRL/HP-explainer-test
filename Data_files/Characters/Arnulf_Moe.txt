'''Arnulf Moe''' was a Norwegian wizard and the manager of the [[Norwegian National Quidditch team]] in [[2014]]. It was his decision to change the team mascot from performing [[troll]]s to the [[Selma]]. When questioned about the change after conflict the Selma had with the [[Fiji]]an [[Dukuwaqa]], Moe defended his choice, claiming that the Selma represented the "steely determination and ferocity of the Norwegian players".<ref name=PM>{{PM}} - [[DISASTROUS OPENING CEREMONY LEADS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP SECURITY]] (Archived)</ref>
