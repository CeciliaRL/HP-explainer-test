==Biography==
Sometime throughout her education, she [[teapot to ferret spell|changed a teapot into a ferret]], albeit poorly, as its nose remained being a spout. A "rather large" [[Slytherin]] boy then chased after it with a [[butterfly]] net. A [[second year]] student witnessed this incident, and eventually wrote about it in a book after becoming an author. A copy of this book eventually found its way into the [[Hogwarts Library]] by the [[1992-1993 school year]].<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>
