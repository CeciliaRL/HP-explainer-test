==Biography==
During the second match of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]], against [[Nigerian National Quidditch team|Nigeria]], Qarase and her fellow Beater [[Narinder Singh]] "lacked the ferocity" of the Nigerian Beaters, [[Aliko Okoye]] and [[Mercy Ojukwu]]. This resulted in the [[Bludger]]s doing much harm to the Fijian [[Chaser]]s, which contributed to the team's bruising defeat.<ref name="PM">{{PM}} - [[NIGERIA VERSUS FIJI]] (Archived)</ref>
