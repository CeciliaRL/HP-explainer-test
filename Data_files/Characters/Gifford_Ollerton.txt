In the [[15th century|fifteenth century]], [[giant]] numbers were relatively big in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]], when compared to today. Wizards became professional giant-slayers in order to restrict these numbers and to protect wizarding communities.

The giant [[Hengist of Upper Barnton]] terrorised the small town of [[Upper Barnton]], in [[England]], at somepoint during the fifteenth century. Gifford Ollerton, at the time a fully-fledged [[Wizardkind|wizard]] rushed to the village's aid, and famously defeated and killed the giant, becoming celebrated as that town's local hero.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>

Gifford Ollerton died in [[1441]], at the age of fifty-one.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

By the [[1990s]], Ollerton's effigy was featured on a [[Chocolate Frog Card]] that celebrated his achievement.<ref name="PSG">{{PS|G}}</ref><ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref><ref name="POAG">{{POA|G}}</ref>
