{{Quote|Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him. Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as to truly join her.|[[Beedle the Bard]], ''[[The Tale of the Three Brothers]]''.|The Tales of Beedle the Bard (real)}}
[[File:3brothers02_woman.jpg|thumb|right|Cadmus is haunted by his lost [[love]]]]
According to [[The Tale of the Three Brothers|legend]], this '''woman''' was in love with [[Cadmus Peverell]], and was set to be married to him before her untimely death. Although Cadmus attempted to use the [[Resurrection Stone]] he had taken from [[Death (The Tale of the Three Brothers)|Death]] to bring her back to the world of the living, she was unable to fully return to life, existing as "neither [[ghost]] nor truly flesh".<ref name="DH34">{{DH|B|34}}</ref> In his despair, Cadmus committed suicide in order to be with her again.<ref name="DH21">{{DH|B|21}}</ref><ref name="TBB">{{TBB|E}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*The [[House of Gaunt]] are direct descendants of [[Cadmus Peverell]], so it is certain that Cadmus had at least one child in his lifetime. It is not specified if this woman was the mother, or if Cadmus had fathered children from a previous or later relationship. If this woman is the mother of Cadmus Peverell's child/children then she is a direct relative to [[Tom Riddle|Tom Riddle Jnr]]. However, as [[Albus Dumbledore]] believed that, in reality, the [[Deathly Hallows]] had not been gifts from [[Death (The Tale of the Three Brothers)|Death]] but rather inventions of the [[Peverell family|Peverells]] themselves, it is also possible that the circumstances of Cadmus' death were embellished somewhat with the passing down of the legend. Yet, it could be true that he created the Resurrection Stone before his fiancee died, likely in childbirth with his heir, and so he committed suicide after the use of his creation taunted him with her solid, undead figure.
**It is possible that she did not exist, and her existence was simply fictionalised by Beedle to explain Cadmus' death. Because there is no way Beedle knew what was really happening, so it is safe to assume that the account in his tale are simply from Beedle's own fancy.
*In the consoles versions {{LEGO|Y2}}, the woman becomes playable only when [[Cadmus Peverell]] uses the [[Resurrection Stone]] at some dangerous events.
*The woman of the story bears some resemblance to the Ancient Greek character of Eurydice. In the myth, Eurydice hoped to marry the musician, Orpheus, but was tricked by a satyr into being bitten on the foot by a poisoned snake on her wedding day. Like Cadmus, Orpheus attempts to being her back from the dead, but sadly fails.
