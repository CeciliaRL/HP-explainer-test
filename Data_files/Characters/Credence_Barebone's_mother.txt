This '''[[Wizardkind|witch]]''' was [[Credence Barebone]]'s biological mother.<ref name="FB88">{{FB|S|88}}</ref>

==History==
Sometime in [[1901]], she gave birth to [[Credence Barebone]].<ref name="FB88"/>

At some point, [[Mary Lou Barebone]] became aware of the fact she was a witch.<ref> Mary would not have known that Credence's mother was a 'wicked, unnatural woman'.</ref>

===After death===
She was mentioned to Credence by [[Mary Lou Barebone]], seconds before getting ready to abuse him after suspecting [[Modesty Barebone]]'s [[Modesty Barebone's wand|toy wand]] was his.<ref name="FB88"/>

It is unknown what happened to her, but it is possible that she died prior to [[1926]], as Mary Lou referred to her in the past tense.<ref name="FB88"/>

While looking for his true identity, [[Credence Barebone]] searched all around [[Europe]] for his mother, with information from his [[Credence Barebone's adoption certificate|adoption certificate]].<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*If Credence was indeed a [[Dumbledore family|Dumbledore]], this woman could have been [[Kendra Dumbledore]], although this is currently unproven.
