'''President Valentina Vázquez''' was an [[Argentina|Argentinian ]][[Wizardkind|witch]] and the [[President of the Council of Magic|President]] of the [[Argentinian Council of Magic]] in [[2014]].<ref name="PM"/>

==Biography==
It was under her regime that the Council staged the disastrous opening for the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup]], which escalated into a fight between various team mascots prompted by an attempt to make the [[Fiji]]an [[Dukuwaqa]] and [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Selma]] share a lake. Vázquez issued a public statement following the event, noting that the Council had been expecting the Norwegians to bring a group of performing [[troll]]s, and as no studies had been done into the compatibility of Dukuwaquas and Selmas, no liability could be afforded to her Council.<ref name="PM">{{PM}} - [[DISASTROUS OPENING CEREMONY LEADS TO QUESTIONS ABOUT QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP SECURITY]] (Archived)</ref>

President Vázquez attended the final of the [[2014 Quidditch World Cup|427th Quidditch World Cup]], on [[11 July]]. Shortly before the match started, she was spotted by ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' reporter [[Rita Skeeter]] chatting to the Chairman of the [[International Confederation of Wizards Quidditch Committee|ICWQC]], [[Mentor Metaxas]].<ref name="the-qwc2014-final">{{PM}} - [[2014 Quidditch World Cup final]] (Archived)</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*Given that she was South American, it is possible that she attended [[Castelobruxo]] in [[Brazil]]. Alternatively, it is also possible that she was home-schooled or attended a less regulated wizarding school.
