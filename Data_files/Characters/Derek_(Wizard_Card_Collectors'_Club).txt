==Behind the scenes==
{{Quote|A football card! This is what Derek was talking about... I wonder if he would trade this for a Famous Witches and Wizards Card.|The cut line (presumably intended for Harry), that named Derek.|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)}}
*Derek is never referred to by name in the normal gameplay of all the video games he makes an appearance. The line of dialogue that mentions his name was intended to be used in the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game)|Game Boy Color version]] of {{COS}}. However, this piece of dialogue was cut and went unused, though it still appears in the game's ROM.<ref name="CRF"/>
