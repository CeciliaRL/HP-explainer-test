'''Mopsus''' was a blind [[Seer]] whose power was great enough for him to accurately predict future events.<ref name="itv">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-edinburgh-ITVcubreporters.htm 16 July, 2005 Edinburgh press conference] on Accio Quote!</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*[[J. K. Rowling]] stated at a press conference in [[2005]] that Mopsus was ''"a very, very early character"'', conceived of while she was still in the process of planning out {{PS}}.<ref name="itv"/> She said she chose to cut him because his skill at [[Divination]] was "too good", and that having such a talented [[Seer]] around during [[Harry Potter]]'s time would be detrimental to the story's drama, because it meant there would be someone who knew how things were going to turn out.<ref name="itv"/> However, it seems Mopsus may not have been discarded until after the [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets|second book]], as he is given as the [[Professor]] of Divination on a list of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] teachers which Rowling created at the time she was working on {{POA}}.<ref name="lex">"[http://www.hp-lexicon.org/about/sources/jkr.com/jkr-com-trans-jottings1.html More idle jottings (Page 1)]" on The Harry Potter Lexicon</ref>
