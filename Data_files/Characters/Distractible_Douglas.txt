'''Distractible Douglas''' was a character in [[Miranda Goshawk]]'s conundrum "[[The Sorry Story of Distractible Douglas]]", published in the ''[[Book of Spells]]''. Like all characters in these conundrums, he was based on a real [[Wizardkind|wizard]], but had his name altered to protect his identity. Douglas was easily distracted, and liked being so.<ref name="WBS">{{WBS}} - see [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QCPN3KmWEMA&feature=context-shows&list=SL this video].</ref>
