==Biography==

===Early life===
Aurélie attended [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]],<ref name="HM Beauxbatons 1"/> where she constantly felt overshadowed by her brother, [[Davet Dumont]].<ref name="HM Beauxbatons 3"/>

====Visiting Hogwarts====
At one point during the [[1985–1986 school year]], Aurélie visited [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], supposedly considering a transfer. Penny introduced her to [[Jacob's sibling]], who proceeded to give her a tour of the [[Hogwarts Castle|castle]] alongside [[Rowan Khanna]].<ref name="HM Beauxbatons 1"/> However, they soon noticed that Aurélie was acting suspicious and seemed to be searching the school for an item.<ref name="HM Beauxbatons 2">{{HM|2|Hosting the Beauxbatons|2}}</ref> When confronted by Jacob's sibling, Aurélie admitted that she came to Hogwarts hoping to find an [[Alchemy]]-related artefact.<ref name="HM Beauxbatons 3"/>

After reading about alchemy, Aurélie and Jacob's sibling realised that the artefact was most likely a [[Nicolas Flamel's chalice|chalice]] that belonged to [[Nicolas Flamel]].<ref name="HM Beauxbatons 3"/> However, they soon were asked to visit [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s office, where he encouraged Aurélie to stop comparing herself to her brother and informed her that if the chalice did exist, it was not hidden at Hogwarts. She decided to pursue Alchemy not to outdo her brother, but because she enjoyed the subject. Afterwards, she said good-bye to Jacob's sibling and Penny, and returned to Beauxbatons.<ref name="HM Beauxbatons 4">{{HM|2|Hosting the Beauxbatons|4}}</ref>
