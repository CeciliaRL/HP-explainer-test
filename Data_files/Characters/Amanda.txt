==Biography==
[[File:Amanda2.png|200px|thumb|left|Amanda's first flying lesson]]
She was [[Sorting Hat|sorted]] in [[Ravenclaw]] in [[1991]] with [[Professor]] [[Filius Flitwick]], the [[Charms Master]], as her [[Head of House]]. During her first [[Flying (class)|flying lesson]], she was personally greeted by her [[Flying Instructor]], [[Rolanda Hooch|Madam Rolanda Hooch]], at the beginning of the class.<ref name="PSF">{{PS|F}} - Chapter 15 (''New Seeker'')</ref>

It is unknown what happened to her during Harry's other years at Hogwarts or when the [[Battle of Hogwarts]] occurred.

==Behind the scenes==
*Amanda did not appear in any of the books, and appeared solely in ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'' film.
*She was portrayed by [[Christina Petrou]] in the film.
*A shortened form of the name ''Amanda'' is ''Mandy''. Also in her first year in [[1991]] was [[Mandy Brocklehurst]], a [[Ravenclaw]] like Amanda.<ref name="PS7">{{PS|B|7}}</ref> It is a possibility therefore, that Amanda and Mandy are the same person, just addressed in different ways.

==Etymology==
''Amanda'' is a feminine form of ''Amandus''. However, it was not used during the Middle Ages. In the 17th century it was recreated by authors and poets who based it directly on Latin amanda "lovable, worthy of love". Notably, it was used by the playwright Colley Cibber for a character in his play 'Love's Last Shift' (1696). It came into regular use during the 19th century.<ref>http://www.behindthename.com/name/amanda</ref>
