{{Quote|Take one ill-fated performance of Malecrit's classic wizarding play 'Alas, I have Transfigured my Feet'. History does not record the names of the actors, which is perhaps for the best since by halfway throught the first act the audience had taken to throwing pumpkins.|[[Miranda Goshawk]], ''[[Book of Spells]]''|Wonderbook: Book of Spells}}
This '''individual''' was an actor who played the part of [[Grenouille]] in a disastrous performance of [[Malecrit]]'s classic wizarding play ''[[Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré Les Pieds]]''. The names of the actors of this particular performance were not recorded and, as such, are unknown to history.<ref name="Wonderbook">{{WBS}} - Chapter 2, Part 1</ref>

This individual's performance, alongside the performance of the [[Actor who played Crapaud|wizard]] who played [[Crapaud]], was not particularly appealing and, as such, the bored audience spent much of act one throwing pumpkins at them.<ref name="Wonderbook" />

During the eponymous foot-transfiguration scene, the [[special effects wizard]] tried to liven up the play by conjuring a [[Fire-Making Spell|stream of flames]] instead of the puff of yellow smoke he was supposed to conjure. The actor playing Grenouille was on-stage at the time, and fled in panic with the rest of the cast when the curtains caught alight, setting the whole theatre ablaze.<ref name="Wonderbook" />
