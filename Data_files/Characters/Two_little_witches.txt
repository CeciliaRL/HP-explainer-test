The '''two little [[Wizardkind|witches]]''' were toddler-age sisters who attended the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]] with their parents.<ref name="GOF7"/>

==Biography==
During the [[1994 Quidditch World Cup]], [[Harry Potter]] spotted them. They looked a little older than [[Kevin]], who was about two, and were both flying around on [[toy broomstick]]s that rose only about two feet off the ground. A [[British Ministry of Magic|Ministry of Magic]] official caught sight of them and went to warn their parents — who he assumed were still in bed — against letting children display [[magic]]al abilities in plain view. It is also possible that the girls' parents were simply unaware of the presence of [[Non-magic people|Muggles]] nearby.<ref name="GOF7">{{GOF|B|7}}</ref>
