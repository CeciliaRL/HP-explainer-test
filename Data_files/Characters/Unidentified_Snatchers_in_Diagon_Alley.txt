This gang of '''[[Snatchers]]''' could be found patrolling the streets of [[Diagon Alley]] in [[1997]]-[[1998]].<ref name="DHF1"/><ref name="DHF2"/>

==History==
During the time in which [[Death Eaters]] [[Fall of the Ministry of Magic|controlled]] the [[British Ministry of Magic]] in the late [[1990s]], these Snatchers patrolled the dark and derelict streets of [[Diagon Alley]], intimidating other [[Wizardkind|wizards]] with their threatening presence. In [[1997]], [[Mundungus Fletcher]] saw them, and hid in an alleyway to avoid them spotting him.<ref name="DHF1">{{DH|F1}}</ref> 

In [[1998]], the [[trio]] and [[Griphook]] saw these Snatchers patrolling the streets of [[Diagon Alley]] as they were entering [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]].<ref name="DHF2">{{DH|F2}}</ref> It is likely, although unproven that these Snatchers participated in the [[Battle of Hogwarts]], on [[2 May]] 1998, and were killed by [[Neville Longbottom]] when he blew up the [[Wooden Bridge]] which the Snatchers tried to cross.<ref name="death"/>
