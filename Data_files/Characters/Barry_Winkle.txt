'''Barry Wee Willie Winkle''' (b. [[14 August]], [[1236]]) was the [[List of oldest wizards|oldest]] known [[wizardkind|wizard]] in the [[1990s]], when he reached the age of 755. To celebrate the occasion, he held a massive party, inviting every wizard and witch he had ever known, a total of thirty million people. It was one of the biggest parties in wizarding history. The scale of this party made ''[[Daily Prophet]]'' headlines in 1991.<ref name="PSf">{{PS|F}} - see [http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19801/lot/97/ this image].</ref>

==Etymology==
The name may be a reference to "{{wplink|Wee Willie Winkie}}", a [[Scotland|Scottish]] poem about a boy who does not want to go to sleep.

==Behind the scenes==
*How Winkle attained such an advanced age (older than even [[Nicolas Flamel]], who had access to a [[Philosopher's Stone]]) is unknown. He may have possessed a Philosopher's Stone of his own, created a [[Horcrux]] or otherwise staved off ageing through some other magical means, though this is pure speculation. It is of course possible that he was of unusually good health, even for a wizard, and reached this age naturally, though such a thing would be unheard of.
*If every wizard and witch he has ever known attended his party, it means either that there were wizards older than him or that [[ghost]]s also attended it. It can also be assumed, however, that it included only wizards and witches who were still alive.
*Giving the ''Daily Prophet'''s habit for heavily exaggerating or fluffing up details or putting in their own biased assumptions on matters to make them more intriguing, it is unknown - perhaps even extremely unlikely - whether or not the amount of individuals attending a simple party to have actually been in the millions. It is also unlikely such a number of wizards and witches exist in the world. In addition, Barry Winkle's exact age may also be an exaggeration.
