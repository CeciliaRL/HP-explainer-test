'''Moribund''' was the shopkeeper of [[Moribund's]], in [[Knockturn Alley]]. The shop is the neighbouring shop of [[The Spiny Serpent]] and is opposite [[Borgin and Burkes]]. The shop's door is kept locked at all times, despite the shop being open. This allows Moribund to have a select customer market. As the forebear of shopkeeper [[Garrick Ollivander]] did in the case of [[Ollivanders]], Moribund chose to give his establishment the family name. The shop is lit by candle light and has a rather messy exterior.<ref name="COSG">{{COS|G}}</ref>

==Etymology==
'Moribund' is of Latin origin, mori - to die and bundus being a suffix. Moribund is also an adjective having three defintions: 1.in a dying state; near death, 2. on the verge of extinction or termination, 3. not progressing or advancing; stagnant. In its modern usage, it often suggests an apathy and listlessness which preclude much hope of improvement.
