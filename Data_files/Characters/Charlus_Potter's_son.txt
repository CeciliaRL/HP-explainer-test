The '''only child and son''' of [[Charlus Potter]] and [[Dorea Black]] was a [[pure-blood]] wizard.<ref name="BFT">[[House of Black|Black family tree]] {{see image|File:JKRBlackFamilyTree.jpg}}</ref> He was a first cousin of [[Walburga Black|Walburga]], [[Alphard Black|Alphard]] and [[Cygnus Black III|Cygnus Black]] on his mother's side.<ref name="BFT"/> He was also related in some way to [[James Potter I|James Potter]] and his son, [[Harry Potter]], on his father's side.

==Behind the scenes==
*It was once speculated that [[James Potter I|James Potter]] was in fact Charlus Potter's son. However, the actual names of James's parents, [[Fleamont Potter|Fleamont]] and [[Euphemia Potter]], were revealed via {{PM}}.<ref name="PotterFamilyPottermore">{{WW|the-potter-family}}</ref> In spite of this, it is still more than likely that this individual might be a cousin of James Potter and his descendants.
*Ironically, although it was not James, this man was related to many of those close to [[Harry Potter]], for instance, being first and foremost an obvious relative on his father's side, a first cousin once removed of [[Sirius Black|Sirius]] and [[Regulus Black]] and [[Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix]], [[Andromeda Tonks|Andromeda]] and [[Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Black]], and so a cousin of [[Nymphadora Tonks|Nymphadora]] and [[Edward Lupin|Ted Lupin]] and [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]] and [[Scorpius Malfoy]] respectively, a second cousin of [[Arthur Weasley]], and a possible distant relative of [[Neville Longbottom]].<ref>He may be a descendant of [[Callidora Black]] and [[Harfang Longbottom]], though this is unconfirmed</ref>
*If Harry really didn't have any living relatives other than the [[Dursley family|Dursleys]] by [[1981]], it can be assumed that Charlus, Dorea and their son were all dead by that date, although it is not fully confirmed.
*This individual was not featured on the Potter family tree on Pottermore.
