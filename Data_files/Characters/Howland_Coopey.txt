'''Howland Coopey''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who sent a letter to the ''[[Daily Prophet]]'s'' advice column<ref name=":0">[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[1 June]], [[1999]], Problem Page</ref>. He was sick and wanted to know if the symptoms he was experiencing — a green-and-purple rash between his toes and sparks coming out of his nostrils when he sneezed — were cause for concern. In his reply, [[Helbert Spleen|Professor Spleen]] informed Coopey that he was suffering from a ''"simple case"'' of [[Dragon Pox]]<ref name=":0" />. Oddly, despite Dragon Pox being potentially fatal, Professor Spleen does not recomned he go to St Mungo's, but rather to "immerse [his] nose continually in ice cold water<ref>https://www.hp-lexicon.org/thing/problem-page/im-turning-purple/</ref>."
