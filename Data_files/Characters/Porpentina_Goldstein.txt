===Global wizarding war===
====Meeting Newt Scamander====
{{Quote|Mr Scamander, do you know anything about the wizarding community in America? We don't let things loose.|Tina regarding the opening of Newt's case|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
In [[1926]],<ref name="pottermore-everything" /> Tina was living in a [[wikipedia:brownstone|brownstone]] with her sister at [[679 West 24th Street]] in [[New York]].<ref name="macusaid" /><ref name="collider" /><ref name="entertainmentweekly1-queenie">"[http://www.ew.com/gallery/fantastic-beasts-characters/2368643_alison-sudol-queenie-goldstein 'Fantastic Beasts' Character Descriptions Revealed]" (Queenie Goldstein) from ''Entertainment Weekly''</ref> On [[6 December]] [[1926]], Tina left from work and observed Mary Lou preaching in an anti-witchcraft rally at the steps of [[Steen National Bank]]. She noticed a [[billywig]] flying above them before she met [[Great Britain|British]] [[magizoologist]] [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], who was running through the crowd in search of a [[Niffler]] that had escaped [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|his suitcase]]. Tina thought he seemed strange and decided to follow him.<ref name="wb" />

[[File:Tina Goldstein confronting Newt Scamander.jpg|250px|thumb|Tina confronting Newt Scamander after an incident within the [[Steen National Bank]]]]
Seeing Newt reveal his wand and [[Apparition|Apparate]] with [[Non-magic people|No-Maj]] [[Jacob Kowalski]], she apprehended Newt. She asked him why he caused a disruption inside the bank and whether he [[Memory Charm|Obliviated]] Jacob. He revealed that he had not, and Tina discovered that he knew very little about how things worked in America's wizarding community. Tina took him in to MACUSA headquarters on a [[Section 3A]]: failing to Obliviate a No-Maj.<ref>{{FB|S|17}}</ref>

[[File:NewtTinaGraves-WandPermitOffice.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Tina with Newt and Graves]]
Once they arrived at the headquarters, Tina interrupted a meeting being held by [[President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America|President]] [[Seraphina Picquery]], who interrupted her attempts to explain herself and then sent her away. Returning to her office, she and Newt were eventually joined by the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, [[Percival Graves]], who wanted to know about Newt's suitcase. However, when she opened it, she found it contained pastries belonging to Jacob. She and Newt then realised that he and Jacob had accidentally taken each other's cases instead of their own. The two left to retrieve Newt's suitcase from the No-Maj.

[[File:Tine and Queenie Goldstein.jpg|250px|thumb|Tina introduces her sister Queenie to Newt and Jacob]]
Arriving at Jacob's apartment, they found it in partial ruin, which Newt quickly repaired. They found Jacob unwell, having been bitten by a [[murtlap]], and discovered creatures had escaped. Tina offered them a place to stay at her home, believing it best to keep the No-Maj with them until he recovered. She introduced them to her [[Queenie Goldstein|sister]], and they shared a meal together. She later showed them to their room and left them alone. However, when she checked up on them later that evening, she found both men and the suitcase missing.

====Evading MACUSA====
{{Quote|You tipped them off?!|Tina, to Gnarlak|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:Jacob Tina Newt MACUSA.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Tina, Newt and Jacob being arrested]] 
She tracked them down to an ice rink under a bridge in [[Central Park]]. When they climbed into the suitcase, Tina locked it and took it to MACUSA where she interrupted a delegation of the [[International Confederation of Wizards]] to inform them about the creatures and the wizard who smuggled them into the country. Newt was immediately blamed for allowing one of his creatures to murder Senator [[Henry Shaw Junior|Henry Shaw Jnr]]. However, upon observing the scars and markings on Shaw's body projection, Newt stated that only an [[Obscurus]] could have left the distinct markings upon his body, which caused unrest in the room, during which President Picquery denied the existence of any Obscurus in America. Tina, Newt and Jacob were<span> soon taken under arrest and Newt's case was impounded. In the jail cell, Tina and Newt explained the meaning of an Obscurus to Jacob and how no record existed at the time of an Obscurial having existed past the age of ten. </span>

[[File:Fantastic-beasts-tina_death_cell.jpg|248x248px|thumb|Tina in the [[Death Cell]] suspended above a pool of Death potion about to be executed]]
Later, Deputy Officer [[Gellert Grindelwald|Graves]] discovered the harmless Obscurus that Newt had contained in his suitcase and, during an interrogation, accused Newt of conspiring with [[Gellert Grindelwald]]. Against Newt's protests, he sentenced both Tina and Newt to death. In the [[Death Cell]] Tina had her memories extracted and was strapped into a chair. While she was hovering above the [[death potion]], she witnessed a memory of herself attacking Mary Lou Barebone and comforting Credence. She also witnessed memories of her parents. During this time, Newt was able to free himself from his restraints with the help of his [[bowtruckle]], [[Pickett]]. Newt then used a [[Swooping Evil]] to rescue Tina. They tried to flee MACUSA but were pursued by several Aurors. They bumped into Queenie and Jacob, who managed to get Newt's suitcase; they climbed into it, and Queenie walked out of MACUSA headquarters with it, allowing them to escape undetected. 

[[File:Newt and Tina at Blind Pig.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Tina and Newt in the [[The Blind Pig|Blind Pig]]]]
The group made a plan to retrieve the last two escaped creatures. However, since one was invisible, they needed help locating it. Tina took everyone to [[the Blind Pig]] to meet [[Gnarlak]], who agreed to give them the information they desired for a price: Gnarlak wanted Newt's bowtruckle Pickett to use for picking locks. Newt reluctantly agreed to the exchange, and they received the information they were looking for. However, Gnarlak betrayed them to MACUSA. The group Apparated away in time to escape the Aurors, retrieving Pickett in the process.

====Obscurial attack on New York City====
{{Quote|Newt! Save him!|Tina|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay}}
[[File:Newt catching Occamy.gif|220x220px|thumb|Tina and Newt catching Occamy]]
Heading to a [[Macy's]] department store, they discovered Newt's [[Demiguise]] stealing things for an overlooked [[Occamy]]. After some initial difficulties, Tina helped entrap the Occamy in a teapot, bringing an end to the search for escaped creatures.

[[File:Duel in New York.gif|220x220px|thumb|left|Tina attempting to duel a disguised Grindelwald]]
They then head to the rooftop of a building where they stumbled across Credence in [[Obscurus]] form fleeing from Aurors. Newt decided to try to save him, and Tina followed him. She met Percival Graves again, and they [[Duelling|duelled]]. Tina held her own until Graves wandlessly and non-verbally threw a car at her, telling her that she always showed up at the worst time.

Tina then managed to make her way to the subway station, where Credence was. She attempted to calm him down and was nearly successful; however, the arrival of President Picquery and the MACUSA Aurors agitated him, and he was seemingly destroyed by the Aurors' attacks. This angered Graves, whom advanced on the President. He then proceeded to dispatch Aurors with unparalleled skill and speed. Fortunately for the group, Newt managed to distract him with his Swooping Evil and bind him with a spell, while Tina used a [[Summoning Charm]] to relieve him of his wand. Newt used the [[Revelio Charm]] to unmask "Graves" as [[Gellert Grindelwald]] in disguise. Grindelwald was apprehended. Afterwards, Tina witnessed the [[Thunderbird]] [[Frank (Thunderbird)|Frank]] Obliviate every No-Maj in New York. Since Jacob was a No-Maj, he needed to be Obliviated as well. Tina, along with Queenie and Newt, said goodbye to him before he lost all of his memories of their time together. Tina was also restored to the position of Auror, after Newt told Mrs Picquery some warm words about her.

[[File:FB-TRL3-89383.jpg|245px|thumb|left|Newt and Tina saying a temporary goodbye]]
One week later she bid farewell to Newt as he boarded a ship home to Great Britain. They shared a tender moment before he had to leave her, and Newt promised to meet her again to deliver his book {{FB}} to her.

====Correspondence with Newt====
Tina and Newt had corresponded by letter after their meeting in New York, but a series of missteps on Newt's part, namely his characterisation of [[Auror]]s as "career-driven hypocrites", had soured the relationship. Tina eventually read in [[Spellbound (disambiguation)|Spellbound]] a wrong account of the upcoming marriage between [[Theseus Scamander]] and [[Leta Lestrange]], becoming convinced that Newt had patched up his relationship with Leta and was ready to marry her. The belief that Newt had rekindled his relationship with Leta was too much, and Tina broke off contact with Newt, and started seeing a fellow Auror named [[Achilles Tolliver]].

====Search for Credence Barebone====
[[File:Tina talks with Skender.jpg|250px|thumb|Tina talking with Skender]]
Sometime in [[1927]], Gellert Grindelwald has escaped during his transfer to [[Europe]]. Tina learned that Credence survived the battle in New York and has been sighted also in Europe, lately in [[Paris]]. While looking for the Obscurial in Paris, she talked with [[Skender]], the [[Circus Arcanus]] owner. During the show of [[Nagini]], the [[Maledictus]], Credence released several beasts to allow himself and Nagini time to escape. Tina tried to chase him but unsuccessfully.

[[File:Tina talking with Yusuf.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Tina talking with Yusuf]]
After that Tina met [[Yusuf Kama]], a wizard and another interested in Barebone. After a short exchange of sentences in the cafe, Tina learned from Yusuf that he is somehow related to Credence, because his [[Laurena Kama|mother]] was also a mother of Leta Lestrange, which [[Corvus Lestrange (IV)|father]] in turn was a father of [[Corvus Lestrange (V)|Corvus Lestrange]], supposed to be Credence, as [[pure-blood]]'s rumours said. To prove it he took Tina to his [[Yusuf Kama's hideout|hideout]] in the sewers, and imprisoned her there.<ref name="COGS">{{COG|S}}</ref>

[[File:Tina in sewers.jpg|250px|thumb|Tina incarcerated in Yusuf's hideout]]
Shortly after, Newt and Jacob arrived to [[France]] to patch up their relationships with Tina and Queenie. They tracked Kama, which took them to the place, where he incarcerated Tina. He did the same with both men, after [[Disarming Charm|disarming]] Scamander. Then Yusuf revealed that he would let them all out when he will kill Credence. Unexpectedly, Yusuf passed out, so Newt used the situation and freed himself, Tina and Jacob with the help of Pickett, who picked the lock in the gate. Approaching the unconscious man, the three heard a roar coming from above.

After pulling Kama out from the sewer they headed to the [[Alexander III Bridge]], where Newt found the [[Zouwu]] and put it back into his suitcase. He then seized Tina, Jacob and Yusuf and apparated with them to [[Rue de Montmorency]], where they went to [[Flamel House|Nicolas Flamel's house]], the "safe house" address which [[Albus Dumbledore]] had given to Newt. Newt removed with tweezers a [[water dragon parasite]] from Yusuf's eye which had been weakening him. Both Tina and Newt deduced that traces on Kama's hands showed that he made an [[Unbreakable Vow]].

====[[Infiltration of the French Ministry of Magic]]====
[[File:Newt disguised as Theseus.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Tina with Newt, who is disguised as Theseus, infiltrating the Ministry]]
After a brief and rushed "goodbye", Tina left to find Credence, but she was pursued by Newt. Tina remained unimpressed by his apologies, until she and Newt saw that Grindelwald was [[Gellert Grindelwald's dark banners|calling]] a [[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|rally]] for his followers. Then Newt came up with an idea to infiltrate the [[French Ministry of Magic Headquarters|French Ministry of Magic]] for family box to confirm Credence's identity. However they are quickly discovered by Theseus, but managed to escape when Tina blasted him into a wall and tied him up.

[[File:Newt and Tina in the Records Room.jpg|220x220px|thumb|Tina and Newt in the Records Room]]
Introducing themselves to Melusine, the Ministry of Magic employee, as Theseus and Leta, Newt and Tina entered the Ministry's [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room|Records Room]]. Newt was finally able to explain to Tina that he was not engaged to Leta and repaired their relationship, before they were discovered by Leta searching for the box too. They discovered that the family box had been moved to the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]] in the [[Cimetière du Père-Lachaise|Père Lachaise Cemetery]]. Melusine detected Newt's and Tina's lie and sent [[Matagot]]s after them and Leta. Newt sent both women into the suitcase and with the help of the Zouwu, that he had saved earlier, he fled to the cemetery.

When Tina and Leta came out from suitcase and Newt packed the Zouwu inside, they all made their way to the Lestrange tomb where they crossed paths with Jacob, Yusuf, Credence and Nagini. Leta stopped Yusuf, her half-brother, from killing Credence, who thought he was her other half-brother, Corvus Lestrange. Leta found out the family box and revealed that she unintentionally killed her infant brother and thus Credence cannot be Corvus. 

====[[Gellert Grindelwald's Paris rally|Grindelwald's Paris rally]]====
[[File:Tina at Grindelwald's rally.jpg|220x220px|thumb|left|Tina during Grindelwald's speech]]
The trail was revealed to have been fabricated by Grindelwald, who was holding a meeting there with his followers. Reluctant, the group made their way into the meeting. At the rally, Grindelwald preached "freedom" from the rules forcing wizards to remain hidden from Muggles, and used future images of World War II to sway them. Although Theseus and other Aurors surrounded the rally, Grindelwald sent his followers forth to spread the message - and made a circle of black flame to separate friends from enemies. Many were killed, and Tina could only watch as her sister walked into the circle.<ref name="COG">{{COG}}</ref> When Grindelwald attacked Newt and Theseus, Leta stopped him and attacked him to allow Newt, Tina, Jacob, Yusuf, Nagini, and Theseus to escape, seemingly sacrificing herself. As Grindelwald escaped, the remaining heroes united alongside the immortal alchemist Nicholas Flamel to defeat Grindelwald's black fire and to save Paris.<ref name="COG" />

[[File:Hogwarts Entrance TCOG.jpeg|220x220px|thumb|Tina and others at Hogwarts]]
Having survived the rally, Tina, along with Newt, Theseus, Jacob, Yusuf, and Nagini, picked up [[Torquil Travers]] and [[Rudolph Spielman]] and travelled to Hogwarts, where Newt brought to Dumbledore the [[Gellert Grindelwald's pendant|Grindelwald's pendant]].<ref name="COG" />

===Later life===
Tina eventually married Newt and moved to the [[Great Britain|United Kingdom]].<ref name="fbb" /> The couple had at least one child, who in turn gave them a grandson, [[Rolf Scamander|Rolf]].<ref name="BWC">[http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2007/0730-bloomsbury-chat.html 30 July 2007 Bloomsbury webchat with J. K. Rowling]</ref> 

As of the late [[20th century]],<ref>The real-world book {{FB|R}} features a biography of Newt Scamander which states he retired in [[1979]]. It also features an introduction by [[Albus Dumbledore]], who, canonically, died in [[1997]]. It can thus be concluded that the information about the Scamanders living in Dorset and owning three Kneazles was current within this timeframe.</ref> she lived with her husband in [[Dorset]] with their pet [[Kneazle]]s: [[Hoppy]], [[Milly]], and [[Mauler]].<ref name="fbb" /> Following her grandson's marriage to [[Luna Lovegood]], Tina became the great-grandmother of twin boys, [[Lorcan Scamander|Lorcan]] and [[Lysander Scamander|Lysander]].<ref name="grandparent" />

Tina was still alive and living in Dorset with her husband in 2017 at the age of 116.<ref>{{FB|2017}}</ref>

==Physical appearance==
Tina Goldstein was a beautiful, slender woman with brown eyes and hair. She usually wore a dark blue jacket over a plain white shirt with long sleeves. Jacob and Newt have both acknowledged her beauty, with the latter citing that "she has the eyes of a [[Fire Dwelling Salamander|salamander]]", which was a compliment coming from the [[Magizoologist]], despite Jacob acknowledging it as a rather awkward and strange comparison.

==Personality and traits==
Tina had a practical, level-headed personality. She was described as being "grounded."<ref>"[http://www.boston.com/entertainment/movies/2015/06/17/everything-know-about-fantastic-beasts-and-where-find-them/UlfBCDS9u8f6rph3o0KOMI/story.html Everything we know about ‘Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them’]" at Boston.com</ref> However, in true [[Thunderbird (House)|Thunderbird]] fashion, Tina was also described as being "very soulful" and possessed ''"a lot of heart, strengths, and courage.''"<ref name="pottermorevideo" /> She was naturally ambitious, and had a desire to stand up for what was right<ref name="entertainmentweekly1" />, which was evident in Tina attacking the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society|Second Salemers]] leader [[Mary Lou Barebone]] after the latter brutally punished her adopted son [[Credence Barebone|Credence]], with Tina later consoling the young man. That incident got Tina a temporary demotion from [[Auror]] to [[Federal Wand Permit Officer]], but she would still keep an eye on the Second Salemers, due to her desire for justice. Another example of her sense of justice was when she turned in Newt and Jacob for unleashing the animals in the former's suitcase, considering it the right thing to do. However, Tina valued her own life, crying softly when faced with execution and fighting the culprit, [[Gellert Grindelwald]]/[[Percival Graves]], with a clear look of apprehension on her face.

Tina was also very persistent, demonstrated during the [[Obscurial attack on New York]] and again during her search for Credence, whom she was determined to protect. Her sister Queenie playfully labelled her as a "career girl". She was also shown to be vastly empathetic, as shown by her interactions with Queenie, Newt, Jacob, and Credence. However, she also had a tendency to become bossy and unnecessarily forceful when things go out of her control. 

Initially, Tina was a valiant and ambitious [[Auror]], but following her demotion, she became discontented and lost some of her nerve. However, her strong will allowed her to not only push through this but also persist with the [[Federal Wand Permit Officer|job]] she was given, but also to oppose the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society|Second Salemer]] No-Majes. Tina initially had a rather neutral opinion about [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], considering him a threat to the Statute of Secrecy. However, due to his handsome appearance, tender heart, and endearing personality, and most of all his recognised innocence and the utter sense of right and wrong they shared, she began developing tender feelings for him, which he certainly reciprocated. For Tina, their exploits together have been a journey of renewal. Her experiences before and during the [[Obscurial attack on New York]] have given her more serenity and allowed her to come to terms with her hardships and attempted to find peace and calm within herself. Having grown bolder and happier, she set her sights on finding and redeeming [[Credence Barebone]], hoping to save him from both the [[Alliance]] and himself. Unlike her sister [[Queenie Goldstein|Queenie]], Tina demonstrated an incorruptible moral code when pushed to the forefront, as she resisted [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s persuasive speech, and joined the [[Global wizarding war|war efforts]] to oppose the Dark Lord.

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Magic]]al mastery''': Tina Goldstein was an accomplished and rather powerful witch, since, as an [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]] student, she excelled in her studies enough to meet the qualifications for [[Auror training]] at the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]], becoming an Auror trusted with important assignments, such as breaking up [[New Salem Philanthropic Society|Second Salemer]] Muggle rallies in [[New York|New York City]], and apprehending [[Credence Barebone]] in [[Paris]]. Tina was also able to successfully aid her future husband, future brother-in-law, [[Yusuf Kama|Yusuf]] and [[Nicolas Flamel]] in saving Paris from the incredibly destructive [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]] conjured by [[Gellert Grindelwald]].
*'''[[Auror]] skills''': Tina was a highly skilful Auror prior to her demotion, with her effectively using [[Gnarlak]] of [[The Blind Pig]] speakeasy as an informant. Even while temporarily demoted to a [[Federal Wand Permit Officer]], Tina still maintained her Auror aptitude, as she quickly deduced that [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] was a foreign wizard with illegal magical beasts, and promptly apprehended Newt before he could react during their first meeting, and was able to later apprehend Newt and [[Jacob Kowalski]] (while they had climbed into the [[Newton Scamander's suitcase|case with magical beasts]]), and bring them before [[Seraphina Picquery|President Picquery]]. After getting reinstated as an Auror, Tina was trusted by the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] with the international assignment of helping the [[French Ministry of Magic]] to track down the [[Obscurial]] [[Credence Barebone]]. Indeed, Tina tracked Credence down to the [[Circus Arcanus]] before any of the [[British Ministry of Magic]] Aurors under [[Theseus Scamander]] did, and then went on to successfully question the gruff Circus owner [[Skender]], and to swiftly deduce that [[Yusuf Kama]] was also interested in Credence. Tina later promptly discovered the location of the [[Lestrange family]] section in the [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room|French Ministry of Magic Archives]]. 
*[[File:Tina duels.gif|thumb|220x220px|Tina duelling with Grindelwald]]'''[[Duelling]]''': As an Auror, Tina was a highly skilled duellist, since she swiftly magically restrained the very powerful fellow Auror [[Theseus Scamander]], though she notably caught him off-guard; and before hand, even without looking, Tina was able to neutralise Theseus' attempt to thwart her and Newt's fleeing from him by magically flinging sealed documents and ledgers their way. Later, Tina helped break up a rally of [[Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes]]. Indeed, Tina's skills were enough for her to temporarily hold her own against a wizard of [[Percival Graves]]' calibre (shown when she duelled [[Gellert Grindelwald]] while the latter was disguised as Graves, and suppressing his abilities enough), managing to dodge the car hurled toward her, but was ultimately defeated. Later on, when Grindelwald fought at full capability, Tina, even alongside Theseus and Newt, both very proficient duellists, was still considerably outclassed, and would have been killed easily had [[Leta Lestrange]] not interfered.
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': As an Auror, Tina was highly accomplished and skilled in this field, with her skills evident in her assistance in breaking up a rally of [[Alliance|Gellert Grindelwald's army]], in her ability to hold off the extremely powerful [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]] cast by [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]] long enough to be saved by [[Leta Lestrange]], and later in her aiding [[Nicolas Flamel]] in casting the [[General Counter-Spell]] to contain and extinguish the violent black flames.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Tina was shown to be highly capable in charms, and had a keen interest in this field, given that she owned the book ''[[Spell Casting in the Age of Rappaport's Law]]''. Tina's talent in charms was shown when she set the table for a dinner using a [[Locomotion Charm]], found the [[Lestrange family]] section in the [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room|French Ministry of Magic Archives]] with a single spell, was able to protect herself for a prolonged period of time against Grindelwald's black fire with the [[Shield Charm]] while on her own before [[Leta Lestrange]] saved her, and when Tina was later able to quickly follow [[Nicolas Flamel]]'s instructions on how to cast the [[General Counter-Spell]] necessary to contain and extinguish the expanding black fire.
*'''[[Transfiguration]]''': As an Auror, Tina was skilled in Transfiguration, notably being able to transform her clothing into a dress before entering the [[The Blind Pig|Blind Pig]] speakeasy, and later [[Incarcerous Spell|conjuring ropes]] to bind [[Theseus Scamander]].
*'''[[Divination]]''': Tina had some knowledge of the subject, as she demonstrated a familiarity with [[The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus]] in a conversation with [[Yusuf Kama]].
*'''[[Apparition]]''': Tina, like most accomplished adult wizards and witches, could Apparate, with her doing so across [[New York|New York City]] and [[Paris]] with relative ease. Indeed, Tina was more skilled at Apparating than most, since she swiftly apprehended [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]] before he could react during their first meeting and Apparated away from the [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]] left by [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]], while also saving [[Jacob Kowalski]] in the process.
*'''[[Nonverbal spell|Nonverbal magic]]''': Tina was quite skilled at casting nonverbal spells, as she set the table for dinner using a [[Locomotion Charm]], [[Transfiguration|transfigured]] her clothing into a dress, restrained [[Theseus Scamander]], duelled against [[Gellert Grindelwald]] (disguised as [[Percival Graves]]), found the [[Lestrange family]] section in the [[French Ministry of Magic Records Room|French Ministry of Magic Archives]], and later assisted [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], [[Theseus Scamander]], [[Nicolas Flamel]], and [[Yusuf Kama]] in containing and dissipating the lethally dangerous [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]] left behind by [[Gellert Grindelwald|Grindelwald]], all without uttering a single [[incantation]].
*'''Indomitable willpower''': Tina possessed immense willpower and bravery, since she persisted with her job at the [[Magical Congress of the United States of America|MACUSA]] after being demoted to a [[Federal Wand Permit Officer]], she did her best to reach out to [[Credence Barebone]] despite [[Gellert Grindelwald]] getting in her way, and she consistently found excuses to oppose the [[New Salem Philanthropic Society|Second Salemer]] No-Majes. Tina's willpower also allowed her to fairly quickly snap out of the mesmerising effect of the [[Death potion]]. Moreover, Tina, unlike her sister [[Queenie Goldstein|Queenie]], demonstrated an incorruptible moral code, as she resisted [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s persuasive speech, and joined the [[Global wizarding war]] efforts against him.

==Relationships==
===Newt Scamander===
[[File:FB CoHP Newt Tina.png|249x249px|thumb|Tina with [[Newton Scamander|Newt]] in New York]]
Newt, to say the least, was the [[love]] of Tina's life. The two initially got off to a rough start after Tina followed him around while he caused trouble in a bank, and she kept having to demand he take action since he clearly did not want to. Eventually, she turned him in to MACUSA for the threat he was unintentionally posing to New York. However, after he saved her life they began to bond while they were on the run from MACUSA as "Percival Graves" wanted to use her as a scapegoat. They also teamed up when Credence attacked the city. They temporarily parted in good spirits after the fight, with Tina promising to buy his book. Newt said she had "eyes just like a salamander". The two worked together once again when Grindelwald was summoning his followers. Later in her life, she married Newt, with the two happily living together in [[Dorset]], [[England]]. 

===Gellert Grindelwald===
[[File:Grindelwald Profile.jpg|thumb|[[Gellert Grindelwald]], an enemy]]
Tina had interacted with Grindelwald while he was disguised as Percival Graves. Her prim personality put them at odds. During Newt's interrogation, Grindelwald sentenced her and Newt to death, for her participation, without hesitation. Tina attempted to incapacitate him during the hunt for Credence in New York, infuriating him, as he angrily told her she always turned up when he least wanted her, implying she may have intervened with his attempts to find the Obscurus previously. She lost to him when he attempted to crack her skull by throwing a car at her without hesitation, but she survived. A year later, while convincing Queenie to join his ranks, Grindelwald painted Tina in a negative light by telling Queenie that it wasn't the latter's fault for having an Auror as a sister. He then ruthlessly tried to burn her alive with his dark flames and would have succeeded had Leta not interfered.

===Credence Barebone===
Tina first encountered Credence when he was being physically abused by his mother. Outraged, she rescued him and consoled him afterwards. As a result, Tina lost her job and Credence began having dreams about her. She was surprised when he was revealed to be the Obscurus that had been running rampant across New York on a few occasions and had now revealed himself openly. True to her immense compassion, however, she attempted to "save" him rather than share everyone else's objective to destroy him. In her attempts, she battled Grindelwald (Graves) and tried to soothe his intense energy, with Newt noting she was the only person capable of coming anywhere close to reasoning with the Obscurial. She cried out when he was destroyed. When Credence was revealed to be very much alive, she determinedly sought him out, fearing for the child's well-being, though sadly the enemy found him first. 

==Etymology==
''Porpentina'' is derived from the archaic word "Porpentine". Porpentine is a form of the term "porcupine", used by [[William Shakespeare]] in the play [[Hamlet]].<ref>[https://hogwartspensieve.wordpress.com/2016/11/21/name-meanings-fantastic-beasts/ Name Meanings: Fantastic Beasts] by The Hogwarts Pensieve</ref>

''Tina'' originates from the Old English "Tyne" meaning river.

''Esther'' may come from the eponymous heroine of the Book of Esther, a Jewish queen whose story of thwarting the genocide of her people is the basis of the celebration of Purim in Jewish tradition. The name has several proposed origins, including the Median word ''astra,''meaning "myrtle" (which would match Esther's Hebrew name, Hadassah, which shares this meaning); the Persian word ''setareh'', meaning "star" (as Esther was said to be "as beautiful as the Morning Star", aka the planet Venus, named after the Roman goddess of love); or a derivation of Ishtar, an ancient Mesopotamian goddess associated with love, beauty, sex, desire, fertility, war, justice, and political power. The name's root letters in Hebrew mean "hide" or "conceal", with their passive form meaning "to be hidden".

''Goldstein'' is an occupational German name and an Ashkenazi Jewish surname, meaning "gold" with Stein being translated to "stone".

==Behind the scenes==
[[File:TinaPOP.jpg|thumb|Tina Goldstein as a [[POP! Vinyl]]]]
*Tina is portrayed by [[Katherine Waterston]] in the [[Fantastic Beasts (film series)|''Fantastic Beasts'']]'' ''film series.<ref>"[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/harry-potter-spinoff-fantastic-beasts-802443?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews&utm_campaign=THR+Breaking+News_now_2015-06-15+10%3A12%3A20_ehayden 'Harry Potter' Spinoff 'Fantastic Beasts' Finds Its Female Lead]" at [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/ The Hollywood Reporter]</ref>
*Katherine Waterston was around ten years older than her role when she played Porpentina in ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''.
*Tina was the first known student of Ilvermorny introduced in the franchise, though the fact that she attended the school was not revealed until a few months before the ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'' film was released.
*Porpentina was only addressed by her surname and by her nicknames Tina and Teenie in the first film of the ''Fantastic Beasts'' series; her full name could only be read on her MACUSA Identity Card, which in turn confirmed her identity as [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]]'s future wife.
