'''Trisha Buttermere''' was a [[Hufflepuff]] [[Wizardkind|student]] at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in the [[1990s]]. She was extremely fond of [[Butterbeer]] and kept a large supply of it at Hogwarts, which allowed her to trade bottles of the beverage for [[Wizard's Chess|chess]] pieces, [[Chocolate Frog Card]]s, and [[Gobstones]] during the [[1996–1997 school year]].
