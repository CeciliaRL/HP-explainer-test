{{Quote|I am Zygmunt Budge, and I am the greatest potion-maker ever born. This is no empty boast. I invented many of the wizarding world's most powerful potions.

'''Zygmunt Budge'''<ref name="PMI">[http://insider.pottermore.com/2013/06/unveiling-wonderbook-book-of-potions.html Unveiling Wonderbook: 'Book of Potions' for PlayStation® 3 - Pottermore Insider]</ref> was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and an expert [[potioneer]], one of the most accomplished ever known. Considered an "eccentric, unstable, and vengeful wizard", he was a student at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in his youth, but left the school at the age of fourteen. After this, he would move to the remote island of [[Hermetray]] in the [[Hebrides]], where he lived in solitude, conducted experiments and wrote the ''[[Book of Potions]]'', a [[List of books|textbook]] on the brewing of various [[potion]]s.<ref name="PSBLOG">[http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2013/10/31/wonderbook-book-of-potions-arrives-on-ps3-next-month/ Wonderbook: Book of Potions arrives on PS3 next month - PlayStation.Blog]</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
Zygmunt was born somewhere in the [[Great Britain|British Isles]], in the [[16th century|16th]] or late [[15th century]]<ref name="birthyear" />.

[[File:Zygmunt Budge and Great-grandmother.png|140px|thumb|left|A young Zygmunt Budge, brewing a potion alongside his [[Zygmunt Budge's great-grandmother|great-grandmother]]]][[Zygmunt Budge's mother|His mother]] did not seem to care for him much, referring to him as 'Fungus-face', on account of his not-so-good looks.

His [[Zygmunt Budge's great-grandmother|great-grandmother]] was, however, a "''distressingly giggly''" witch, in sharp contrast of Zygmunt's temperament, even as a child (in his later years, Budge would find that laughter was ''undignified''). This great-grandmother showed an interest in [[Potion|Potion-making]], and handed him down an old recipe for the [[Laughing Potion]], which he set himself the challenge of refining in his adult years.<ref name="BoPlaughingpotion">{{WBP}} - Chapter 5 (''Laughing Potion'')</ref>

===Hogwarts years===
{{Quote|As I've said, it was my life's dream to win the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship. When I judged that I was ready I was fourteen years old, top of my year in Potions, and able to correct my Professor on the proper use of Mackled Malaclaw tails. I asked my Headmaster for permission to enter. But, alas, imagine my horror and disgust when he forbade me! Because I was not yet seventeen, and the competition was "too dangerous".|Zygmunt Budge, ''[[Book of Potions]]''|Wonderbook: Book of Potions}}He was [[Hogwarts acceptance letter|accepted]] into [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and was [[Sorting Ceremony|sorted]] sometime between the years [[1501]] and [[1594]]<ref name="YearofSorting">As he was 14 years old when a Potions Championship was held, he had to be either in his third or fourth year at the time. As it was never specified which month the Potions Championship was held in, this gives three possible options:<br/>1) The Potions Championship was held between [[September]] and [[December]] in his third year, and he had already had his birthday earlier that school year, making his sorting happen in a year two years before a Potions Championship, in the year 1503, 1510, ... 1594.<br/>2) The Potions Championship was held in the year when he finished his third year and started his fourth. He had already had his birthday in his third year, but not fourth. This makes his sorting happen three years before a Potions Championship, in the year 1502, 1509, ...1593.<br/>3) The Potions Championship was held between January and June (as the competition did not take place during the [[summer holidays]]) in his fourth year and he had not yet had his birthday that year. This makes his sorting take place four years before a Potions Championship, in 1501, 1508, ... 1592.</ref>. It is unknown what [[Hogwarts Houses|house]] he was sorted into by the [[Sorting Hat]]. 

[[File:Zygmunt Budge at Hogwarts.png|225x225px|thumb|Zygmunt Budge during his Hogwarts years]]

What Budge considered to have been the most humorous occurrence he had ever witnessed took place during his years at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]]. The incident — a rival student of his spilled [[Love Potion]] onto himself, thus becoming attracted to their [[16th century Potions Professor|ancient Potions professor]] — was one that he recollected whenever he needed a loud roar of uncontrollable laughter for his [[Laughing Potion]].<ref name="BoPlaughingpotion" />

By the time Budge was fourteen, in his third or fourth year, he was top of his class in [[Potions (class)|Potions]], and was even able to correct [[16th century Potions Professor|his Professor]] on the proper use of [[Mackled Malaclaw]] [[Mackled Malaclaw tail|tails]] in potion-making. Having decided he was sufficiently prepared, he asked the Headmaster for permission to enter the [[Wizarding Schools Potions Championship]]. The Headmaster, however, forbade him, because he had not reached the age of seventeen and the competition was too dangerous for him. Furious, Budge decided to drop out of school at once, in protest. Budge considered Hogwarts to have been "''the school that sought to stifle'' [his] ''brilliance as a potioneer''", and never regretted his decision.<ref name="BoPsleepingpotion">{{WBP}} - Chapter 4 (''Sleeping Potion'')</ref>

===Living in seclusion===
{{Quote|Please, understand, some have suggested disappointment warped me. This is nonsense! I enjoyed a long and full life... alone, on Hermetray, working on this, my masterwork, my legacy — the ''Book of Potions''. I always dreamt that one day, this book might accompany a great potioneer to victory at the Championship, and now it feels as though it is in reach!|Zygmunt Budge, ''[[Book of Potions]]''|Wonderbook: Book of Potions}}[[File:Hermetray.png|240x240px|thumb|left|An adult Zygmunt Budge on [[Hermetray]]]]

Zygmunt Budge, however, soon found out that only contestants representing [[wizarding school]]s were permitted to enter the Championship, and that since he had left Hogwarts, he had ceased to be eligible.<ref name="BoPsleepingpotion" />

Angered and embittered, he moved to a remote island, [[Hermetray]] in the [[Hebrides|Outer Hebrides]], where he occupied a [[rat]]-infested [[Zygmunt Budge's house|shack]], and only had [[Zygmunt Budge's sheep|a flock of sheep]] for company (and for occasional potion testing). He lived there the rest of his long life, conducting experiments, perfecting formulae, and creating new concoctions. He also wrote the ''[[Book of Potions]]'', his masterpiece, that he intended to become his legacy for future generations of potioneers.

After his death, some of his personality lingered in his ''Book of Potions'', and was capable of acting like a guide to whoever read the book — in the hopes that, one day, he would be able to aid a budding potioneer to win the [[Wizarding Schools Potions Championship]].

==Magical abilities and skills==
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Zygmunt Budge was a remarkably brilliant [[Potioneer]], with him being considered as one of the most accomplished of his profession in [[Wizarding world|wizarding]] history. Budge showed his remarkable talent from a young age as a [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] student, with his excellent performance in [[Potions (class)|Potions class]] and his superior knowledge of potions and their ingredients, even compared to his [[Potions Master]]. His exceptional skills in potions allowed him to find and invent new and innovative ways of brewing potions as well as outright create his own brews, which were deemed to be among the most powerful potions in the world, with him even writing his own book, the [[Book of Potions|Book'' of Potions'']], as a showcase of his superb knowledge and skills in this field of [[magic]].
*'''[[Herbology]]''': Budge was also very familiar with the magical plants used as ingredients for potions, and capable of thoroughly explaining to the one he chose as his champion their functions.
*'''[[Magizoology]]''': Budge was quite knowledgeable in magical [[creature]]s, as while aiding the one he chose as his champion, he was capable of quickly identifying the weaknesses of the monsters in the way of winning the [[Wizarding Schools Potions Championship]] and figuring out the potion needed to be brewed to overcome them.
*'''[[Charm]]s''': Budge appeared to be considerably skilled in charm-work, as he was capable of enchanting his [[Book of Potions]] to contain some of his personality inside the book and adding several powerful enchantments inside the book to aid the one he chose to represent him as champion for the [[Wizarding Schools Potions Championship]]. He was also capable of sealing inside the book a [[Portkey]] that can take the reader of his book into the [[Enchanted garden (Book of Potions)|Enchanted Garden]] said event was held in.

==Etymology==
*'''[[Wikipedia:Zygmunt|Zygmunt]]''' is a Polish name, adapted from the German '''[[Wikipedia:Sigismund|Sigismund]]''', which, along with its variants '''Sigmund''' and '''Siegmund''' means ''"protection through victory."''
*'''[[Wikipedia:Sigmund|Sigmund/Siegmund]]''' is also the name of a hero from Norse mythology, the father of the [[dragon]]-slayer Sigurd.
*'''Budge''' is an English verb, meaning "to move", often from a state of inactivity. It has been the surname of several prominent persons, including Egyptologist [[Wikipedia:E.A. Wallis Budge|E.A. Wallis Budge]] .'''<nowiki/>'''
