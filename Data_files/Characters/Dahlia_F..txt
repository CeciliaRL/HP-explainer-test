'''Dahlia F.''' was a [[Wizardkind|witch]] who apparently worked as an opera singer. In her childhood, she attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]], and was singled out for membership in the [[Slug Club]]. [[Horace Slughorn]] kept a picture of her in a Viking maiden costume on his shelf, which she had inscribed, "Best wishes."

==Behind the scenes==
*Based on her signature, her surname appears to begin with the letters ''Fl-'', followed by either an ''-a-'' or an ''-e-''. The very last part of the name is Peri.
**It is possible that her name is Dahlia Fleur-Peri.
*It is possible, as a former [[Slug Club]] member, that she attended the [[Slug Club Christmas party|Christmas party]] in [[1996]].
