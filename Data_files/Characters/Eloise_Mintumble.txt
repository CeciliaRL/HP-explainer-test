{{Quote|All attempts to travel back further than a few hours have resulted in catastrophic harm to the witch or wizard involved. It was not realised for many years why time travellers over great distances never survived their journeys. All such experiments have been abandoned since 1899, when Eloise Mintumble became trapped, for a period of five days, in the year 1402. Now we understand that her body had aged five centuries in its return to the present and, irreparably damaged, she died in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries|St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]] shortly after we managed to retrieve her.

'''Madam Eloise Mintumble''' (d. [[1899]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and [[Unspeakable]] in the [[Department of Mysteries]] who died as a result of an experiment to travel back in [[time]] for more than a few hours.<ref name="PM">{{WW|time-turner}}</ref>

==Biography==
Madam Mintumble was trapped, for a period of five days, in the year [[1402]]. When she was finally retrieved to the present, her body had aged five centuries, and, irreparably damaged, she [[Death|died]] in [[St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries]]. Her excursion to the past provoked a great disturbance to the [[life path]]s of all those she met, changing the present so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been "[[un-born]]". Moreover, there were a few more alarming signs that time itself had been disturbed: Tuesday following her reappearance lasted two and a half days, whereas Thursday shot by in the space of four hours.<ref name="PM"/>
