'''Chieftainess Elfrida Clagg''' ([[1612]] - [[1687]]) was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|witch]] and the Chieftainess of the [[Wizards' Council]] either in the [[14th century|fourteenth]]<ref name="FBaWtFT">{{FB|R}} - ''What is a Beast?''</ref> or [[17th century|seventeenth century]].<ref name="JKRS" /> Either way, she was [[Burdock Muldoon]]'s immediate successor of the post.<ref name="FBaWtFT" />

==Biography==
===Early life===
It is debated whether Clagg was born in [[1612]] or about one or two centuries earlier. She presumably attended [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] in her youth, like so many other [[Wizardkind|witches]].

===As Chieftainess of the Wizards' Council===
[[File:Elfrida Clagg POA.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Elfrida Clagg, as depicted in her [[Chocolate Frog Card]]]]
Clagg was [[Burdock Muldoon]]'s successor on the post of Chief of the [[Wizards' Council]]. Madame Clagg attempted to redefine the classification of [[Being]]s and [[Beast]]s by declaring that all those magical creatures that could speak the human tongue were Beings. However, this once more caused problems with the beings meeting as the [[Troll]]s were again classified as Beings and destroyed the meeting chamber, [[Jarvey]]s were in attendance and tore as many Council members' ankles as they could, and the [[Centaur]]s boycotted the meeting as the [[Merpeople]] were not invited. A large delegation of [[ghost]]s also attended, but left in disgust of what they later called "the Council's unashamed emphasis on the needs of the living as opposed to the wishes of the dead".<ref name="FBaWtFT" />

Also, due to the declining numbers of [[Golden Snidget]]s, Clagg made them a protected species, and outlawed both their hunting, and their use in [[Quidditch]] matches.<ref name="QTA4">{{QTA|R|4}}</ref>

==Etymology==
"Elfrida" is from the Old English name Ælfþryð [http://d-k-e.euro.ru/elfsaga.htm meaning "elf strength"] from the element ''ælf'' combined with ''þryð'' "strength". Ælfþryð was a 10th-century queen of England. This name was rare after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 19th century.

==Behind the scenes==
*In {{OOTP}}, a [[portrait]] of a witch called "[[Elfrida Cragg]]" is said to be stationed in the [[British Ministry of Magic Headquarters]].<ref name="OOTP22">{{OOTP|B|22}}</ref> It is possible that this individual's name is a misspelling of Elfrida Clagg.
