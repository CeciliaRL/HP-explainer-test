This '''individual''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]], whose portrait hung at [[Hogwarts Castle]] in the [[1990s]], below a [[portrait of three young ladies]], on the seventh-floor level of the [[Grand Staircase]]. He was bald, very pale and dressed in black robes, flowing as though rushed by a strong wind.<ref name="PA13">{{POA|F}} - Chapter 13 (''Flight of the Fat Lady'')</ref>

==Behind the scenes==
*This portrait bears an uncanny resemblance to [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]], in his appearance from {{GOF|FA}} onwards. However, it seems rather unlikely a portrait of him would have been hung at Hogwarts under the supervision ofÂ [[Albus Dumbledore]].
