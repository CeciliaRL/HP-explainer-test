'''Jeremiah Garnet''' was a [[Great Britain|British]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and radio reporter for the [[Wizarding Wireless Network]].

==Biography==
He was investigating a [[fire]] at the [[Boathouse]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] and believed it to be caused by a [[dragon]]. His zealousness to develop this story led him to fake a [[Jeremiah Garnet's photograph|photograph]] of a dragon flying over Hogwarts. This forgery was discovered by [[Mathilda Grimblehawk]] and [[Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner|her partner]] during their investigation of the fire.<ref>{{FBC|7}}</ref>

Garnet managed to capture the beast responsible for the fire and sent it to the [[Wizarding Wireless Network]] for an exclusive report, but Mathilda and her partner managed to rescue the beast and relocate it.
In addition to reporting, Garnet was also working on ''[[Hogwarts Castle: A History of Cultivated Fungus]]''.
