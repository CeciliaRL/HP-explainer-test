==Behind the scenes==
*Although [[J. K. Rowling]] initially said in interviews that McGonagall was "getting on a bit" and that Hogwarts had a new Headmaster by the time of the Epilogue in {{DH}} (set in [[2017]]), this was later retconned in {{CC}}, which has McGonagall in office as late as [[2020]].
*[[Jack Thorne]]'s original draft of the {{CC}} script featured this individual, and first named him as "Professor Marazion". Rowling herself vetoed this character by saying "''I think Marazion doesn't fit. I think we need Professor McGonagall.''"<ref name="CCJ"/><ref name="TLC2019"/>
