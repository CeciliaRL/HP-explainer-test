{{Quoteurl|Nicolas Flamel is a historical character. Flamel lived in France in the fourteenth century and is supposed to have discovered how to make a Philosopher's Stone. There are mentions of sightings of him through the centuries because he was supposed to have gained [[immortality]]. There are still streets named after Flamel and his wife Perenelle in Paris.|[[J. K. Rowling]] on Nicolas Flamel.|url=https://therowlinglibrary.com/jkrowling.com/textonly/en/faq_view_id=102.html}}
'''Nicolas Flamel''' (c. [[1326]]<ref name="birthyear" />–c. [[1992]]<ref name="death" />) was a [[France|French]] [[Wizardkind|wizard]] and famed [[Alchemy|alchemist]] who was the only known maker of the [[Philosopher's Stone]], a legendary substance with incredible powers. He was a close friend and partner with former [[Hogwarts Headmaster]] [[Albus Dumbledore]]. He owed his considerable age to the [[Elixir of Life]], which was produced from the Stone, along with his wife [[Perenelle Flamel|Perenelle]]. He was well over six hundred years old as of 1992,<ref name="birthyear" /> being one of the [[List of oldest wizards|oldest wizards]] in history.

Flamel was briefly mentioned on [[Albus Dumbledore (Chocolate Frog Card)|Albus Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog Card]].<ref name="PS6">{{PS|B|6}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life {{C|Early 14th century}}===
Nicolas was born in the early [[14th century]]. In his youth, Nicolas attended [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic]] in the [[Pyrenees]] Mountains of [[France]], and it was there that he met [[Perenelle Flamel|Perenelle]], his future wife. It is said that he later funded both the academy's chateau and grounds, and a [[Nicolas and Perenelle Flamel Fountain|fountain]] on the grounds was named after the couple.<ref name="PM">{{WW|beauxbatons-academy-of-magic}}</ref>

===Gaining immortality {{C|Late 14th century–1926}}===
Flamel became a noted alchemist of considerable talent.<ref name="PS13">{{PS|B|13}}</ref> At some point, he created the [[Philosopher's Stone]], an item of immense [[magic]]al power. With the Stone, he created the [[Elixir of Life]], a [[potion]] that made the drinker functionally immortal as long as it was regularly ingested. He and Perenelle regularly used the potion after that time. 

Although it is clear that he used the Elixir to greatly extend his life, it is not specified whether he used the Stone's powers to make himself wealthy, as the Stone is also capable of [[Chrysopoeia|turning any metal into gold]].<ref name="PS13" />

Nicolas was implied to have been in personal combat, but had become inactive in this field by the [[1720s]].<ref>In 1927, Nicolas claimed that he had not "seen action" in about 200 years. 200 years before the 1920s is the 1720s, to say it is a rough approximation.</ref> In 1762 he was spotted at an opera house in Paris.<ref>"''Very early page of Philosopher's Stone''", by [[J. K. Rowling]] {{See image|File:Very early page of Philosopher's Stone.jpg}}</ref>

In the [[1890s]], Nicolas first came into contact with the brilliant teenager [[Albus Dumbledore]].<ref name="DH2">{{DH|B|2}}</ref>

===Gellert Grindelwald's revolution {{C|1927–1945}}===
{{Dialogue a-b|Jacob Kowalski|Are you a ghost?|Nicolas Flamel|No, I'm an alchemist, so therefore I am immortal.|Nicolas regarding what he is to a confused Jacob|Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay}}
When Albus Dumbledore began to take action to stop [[Gellert Grindelwald]], Nicolas Flamel, as his friend, decided to help him in this, and agreed to let him use his [[Flamel House|home]] as a safehouse for any potential allies should the situation require it, and gave him a [[Nicolas Flamel's card|card]] leading to the home. Albus gave [[Newton Scamander]] the card as Albus was unable to participate in the fight.<ref name="COGS30">{{COG|S|30}}</ref> 

In [[1927]], the [[Magizoologist]] [[Newton Scamander]] decided to take advantage of the invitation and arrived at the Flamel House alongside two [[United States of America|Americans]] by the name of [[Porpentina Goldstein]] and [[Jacob Kowalski]], as well as [[Yusuf Kama]]. The three were attempting to track down [[Credence Barebone]], a young wizard important to Grindelwald's plans, though for different reasons. 

Kama, who was attempting to assassinate Barebone, had tried to take Newt and his friends captive in his [[Yusuf Kama's hideout sewers|sewers]], allowing him to track down his target unhindered. However, he had suddenly lost consciousness due to his exposure to the [[Water dragon parasite]] venom. 

Once they had arrived safely at the Flamel House, which was by then well protected by various [[Protective enchantment]]s, Scamander was able to remove the [[Water dragon parasite]] from Kama's eye. Soon after, while Yusuf recovered from the procedure. Newt and Tina travelled to the [[French Ministry of Magic Headquarters|French Ministry of Magic]] to retrieve the [[Lestrange family tree box]].
[[File:Flamel behind Jacob.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Flamel standing behind Kowalski]]
Flamel stood behind a just awokeke and hungry [[Jacob Kowalski]] which he thought was a [[ghost]], to which he replied that he was an alchemist and therefore he was immortal. Kowalski quipped that he did not look more than 375 years old and attempted to shake his hand. Because of Nicolas' frail state due to his extremely advanced age, Jacob's firm grip hurt him and he screamed from the pain. The No-Maj apologised and he was okay.<ref name="COGS86">{{COG|S|86}}</ref>
[[File:Jacob and Flamel watching crystal ball.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Flamel and Jacob Kowalski watching the future events of the day in the alchemist's crystal ball]]
After the greeting, Flamel looked over at his [[Nicolas Flamel's crystal ball|crystal ball]], which showed, among other things, that Grindelwald was about to host a rally for his followers at the [[Lestrange Mausoleum]] at [[Cimetière du Père-Lachaise|Pere Lachaise Cemetery]]. They also saw [[Credence Barebone]] and [[Nagini]] heading there, along with [[Queenie Goldstein]], Tina's sister and Jacob's fiancee. When Jacob saw, he asked Flamel where the place in the ball was located, and requested Nicolas to look after Kama, however when Jacob looked at the place where Yusuf should have been laying, Yusuf was gone, making the request obsolete. While Jacob was running out of the house, Flamel demanded that Jacob went to the Cimetière.<ref name="COGS86"/>
[[File:Flamel talking with Hicks.jpg|250px|thumb|Flamel talking with Eulalie Hicks]]
A moment after Jacob left, the vision in the crystal ball changed and presented the upcoming tragic events at Grindelwald's rally. While watching, the alchemist became scared and wanted to warn Albus with the help of his [[Nicolas Flamel's phoenix-embossed book|book]], he was shocked to see that Dumbledore was not available, so he panickedly flipped a few more pages and found that [[Eulalie Hicks]] was there, who advised him to go immediately. Nicolas had doubts, because he had not been in active battle for two hundred years. However, she declared that everyone believed in him, which made him go.<ref name="COGS86"/>

[[File:Flamel fighting with flames.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Flamel fighting the flames conjured by Grindelwald]]
Flamel arrived as Grindelwald had escaped and unleashed [[Protego Diabolica]] in an attempt to destroy Paris, [[Dark Arts|dark magic]] so powerful and unstable that none of the assembled wizards opposed to the [[Dark Wizard]] knew how to counter it. When Newt, Tina, Jacob, Yusuf, Nagini and [[Theseus Scamander]] ran out of the fire consuming everything, Nicolas ordered them to form a circle, plant their wands in the ground and use the [[General Counter-Spell]]. This created a cleansing orange fire which, directed nonverbally by Flamel and the other, eliminated the effect of Grindelwald's spell and saved the whole of city from destruction.<ref name="COGS115">{{COG|S|115}}</ref>
[[File:Flamel comforting Jacob.jpg|250px|thumb|Nicolas comforting Jacob]]
After containing the flames, Nicolas comforted a tearful Jacob Kowalski, whose fiancée, Queenie, had just left him.<ref name="COGS115"/>

===Death {{C|1990s}}===
{{Quote|To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but to Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going to bed after a very, very long day. After all, to the well-organised mind, death is but the next great adventure.|Albus Dumbledore about Nicolas Flamel's death.|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
By the [[1990s]], Nicolas had moved to [[Great Britain]] with his wife and enjoyed a quiet life in [[Devon]].<ref name="PS13"/> However, the danger of the Stone's existence was brought to light when [[Tom Riddle|Voldemort]], with the help of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]] [[Professor]] [[Quirinus Quirrell]], was nearly successful in stealing it. 

Voldemort, disembodied after his initial attempt to kill [[Harry Potter]] backfired, intended to use the Elixir to restore himself to physical form. Fortunately, his plan was barely thwarted by the efforts of [[Trio|three children]]: [[Harry Potter]], [[Hermione Granger]], and [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]]. 

After consulting with [[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]], Flamel agreed that the stone should be destroyed. Though they had enough [[Elixir of Life|Elixir]] to set their affairs in order, it was expected that they would die shortly thereafter as their supply ran out. When Dumbledore informed Harry of this, the young wizard initially took the news to be terrible. However, Dumbledore assured him that, for them, it would be like "going to bed after a very, very long day", implying that when Nicolas and his wife passed on, their deaths would be dignified and peaceful.<ref name="PS17">{{PS|B|17}}</ref>

At the time of his death, Flamel was over 665 years old.<ref name="Flamel">{{PS|B|13}} - "Mr Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon with his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty-eight)."</ref> 

==Personality and traits==
A kindly old man with a polite disposition, Nicolas Flamel warmly welcomed [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], [[Jacob Kowalski]], [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]], and [[Yusuf Kama]] when they arrived at his home in [[Paris]], treating Dumbledore's "friends" like his own. 

In spite of his advanced age, Nicolas was happy to do what he could to help put an end to the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Gellert Grindelwald]]'s seemingly unstoppable rise to power, and agreed to let his home be used as a safehouse for those who opposed him. Although he appeared to have had some doubts about his own abilities, Nicolas nevertheless proved himself to be a very brave and selfless individual, as he arrived to help Newt Scamander and the latter's allies to fight Grindelwald at the [[Lestrange Mausoleum|Lestrange family Mausoleum]] when called upon to do so by [[Eulalie Hicks]]; though he had not been entirely certain that he was up to the task. 
Although he arrived too late to help fight Grindelwald himself, Nicolas nevertheless displayed great courage both by his timely arrival, and by his help in containing the incredibly powerful, rampant [[Protego Diabolica|black fire]] their foe conjured, and was, as such, instrumental to the efforts to save [[Paris]] from it.
Despite making efforts to hide his [[Philosopher's Stone]] from the wrong hands (first in [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]], then in [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]), Nicolas by the age of 690, much like his friend [[Albus Dumbledore]], ultimately viewed death as "but the next great adventure". Hence, after [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] very nearly succeeded in capturing his Philosopher's Stone, Nicolas willingly had it destroyed, having collected enough [[Elixir of Life]] to set his and his wife's affairs in order.<ref name="PS17"/>

Flamel was also well known for his love of [[Opera]].<ref name="PS13">{{PS|B|13}}</ref>

==Magical abilities and skills==
{{Quote|The ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the Philosopher's Stone, a legendary substance with astonishing powers.|Flamel accomplished what no other alchemist had|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
[[File:Alchemycard.jpg|200px|thumb|Nicolas Flamel studying Alchemy]]
Belying his frail exterior, Nicolas Flamel was a very powerful and accomplished wizard. Rich in learning and experience, testaments to Nicolas' considerable abilities were his proficiency in [[alchemy]], held to be some of the most difficult [[Magic|magic]] known to [[Wizardkind|wizardkind]], and Nicolas helping to save the city of [[Paris]] from the rampant, destructive black fire unleashed by [[Gellert Grindelwald]], the most powerful [[Dark Wizard]] of the early [[20th century]].<ref name="COGS115"/>
*'''[[Alchemy]]''': Nicolas Flamel was perhaps the greatest alchemist the world had ever seen, being the only known person to successfully create a [[Philosopher's Stone]], the ultimate goal of alchemy. With this, Flamel was able to render himself and his wife Perenelle [[Immortality|immortal]] for centuries, until he chose to destroy the stone of his own volition in [[1992]].<ref name="PS13"/>
*'''[[Potion]]s''': Flamel was also an exceptionally gifted [[potioneer]], as by using his alchemical knowledge of the properties of the Philosopher's Stone, he created the [[Elixir of Life]], an incredible potion to make the drinker immortal. The effects of this potion were so extraordinary that by drinking it, he managed to remain alive and well for hundreds of years.<ref name="PS13"/>
*'''[[Defence Against the Dark Arts]]''': Although the exact extent of his skills is uncertain, it is evident that Nicolas Flamel had extensive knowledge of the [[Dark Arts]] and was extremely adept at defending himself from them, as he instantly recognised and knew how to stop the incredibly dangerous and volatile [[Protego Diabolica|fire]] conjured by [[Gellert Grindelwald]], and, along with [[Newton Scamander|Newt]] and [[Theseus Scamander]], [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]], and [[Yusuf Kama]], successfully contained it by means of a combined powerful [[General Counter-Spell]], thus effectively preventing the destruction of [[Paris]]. Nicolas' home was also described by Dumbledore as being heavily warded by various powerful [[protective enchantment]]s after he turned his home into a safehouse for Dumbledore's friends and allies, showing he was very proficient in the casting of them. Furthermore, Nicolas Flamel claimed that he had not "seen action" in about two hundred years, suggesting that prior to [[1927]], he used to be both an active and highly accomplished [[Duelling|duellist]]. Despite his long absence from using [[martial magic]], however, and initial doubt that he would be of any help in fighting [[Gellert Grindelwald]], [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]] professor [[Eulalie Hicks]] had great faith in his defensive abilities, and urged him to go to the [[Lestrange Mausoleum|Lestrange family Mausoleum]] to save Newt and his friends, which he did with great success, showing his impressive talents in this field.<ref name="COGS115"/>
*'''[[Divination]]''': Nicolas Flamel apparently had some ability in Divination, as he could gaze into [[crystal ball]]s and see events unfold elsewhere, such as when he saw [[Credence Barebone]], [[Nagini]], and the upcoming [[Gellert Grindelwald]] rally at the [[Lestrange Mausoleum|Lestrange family Mausoleum]].<ref name="COGS86"/>
*'''[[Wandless magic|Wandless]]''' and '''[[Non-verbal magic]]''': Nicolas Flamel proved capable of using both wandless and nonverbal magic, both of which is advanced and highly difficult to perform even individually, yet Nicolas used both simultaneously when he unlocked the padlock on his [[Nicolas Flamel's phoenix-embossed book|phoenix-embossed book]] by simply touching it.<ref name="COGS86"/>
*'''[[Immortality]]''': Having drunk the Elixir of Life on a continuous basis, Nicolas remained alive for over 600 years.<ref name="PS13"/> However, while this extended his lifespan, his body continued to age, leading to a frail and ancient appearance. His life became completely reliant on the Elixir and the Stone used to brew it. Once he agreed to destroy the Stone and depleted the potion, Nicolas died.<ref name="PS17"/>
*'''Social networking''': Due to having lived over 600 years thanks to the [[Philosopher's Stone]]'s [[Elixir of Life]], Nicolas Flamel has a vast network of international contacts in the whole [[Wizarding world]], communicating with them via his [[Nicolas Flamel's phoenix-embossed book|phoenix-embossed book]]. Notable among his contacts were [[Albus Dumbledore]] of [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Hogwarts]], and [[Eulalie Hicks]] of [[Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry|Ilvermorny]].<ref name="COGS86"/>
*'''Bilingualism''': Nicolas Flamel spoke his native French, as well as fluent English, with only a slight accent in the latter.<ref name="COGS86"/>

==Possessions==

The [[Beauxbatons Academy of Magic|Beauxbatons]] student [[Aurélie Dumont]] sought this chalice in the hopes it could make her a great Alchemist and believed it was hidden at [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]].<ref name="HM2">{{HM|2|Hosting the Beauxbatons}}</ref>

==Relationships==
===Perenelle Flamel===
[[Perenelle Flamel]] was the wife of Nicolas Flamel. Nicolas Flamel shared the [[Elixir of Life]] with Perenelle, making them both functionally immortal until the Stone was destroyed in [[1992]]. <ref name="PS17"/> They lived happily together for the over 600 years that they were together. 

===Albus Dumbledore===
[[File:600full-Albus-Dumbledore-the-prisoner-of-azkaban-photo.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Albus Dumbledore]], his good and long-time friend]] 
{{Quote|Well, Nicolas and I have had a little chat, and agreed it's all for the best.|Albus Dumbledore and Flamel's agreement to destroy the stone|Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone}}
Albus Dumbledore was a close friend to Nicolas. During the [[Global wizarding war]], Flamel let him use his home as a safe house for allies that opposed the [[Dark Wizard]] [[Gellert Grindelwald]], and helped protect [[Paris]] from certain destruction at the hands of said revolutionary leader alongside [[Newton Scamander|Newt Scamander]], [[Theseus Scamander]], [[Porpentina Goldstein|Tina Goldstein]] and [[Yusuf Kama]].<ref name="COGS"/> The faith and trust he had in Dumbledore was evident, and highlighted by his allowing Albus to put the Stone in [[Gringotts Wizarding Bank]] in London in [[1991]] to prevent [[Tom Riddle|Lord Voldemort]] from stealing it. It was also Albus who moved the stone to [[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]] for further protection later the same year.<ref name="PS17"/>

==Etymology==
*''Nicolas'' is the French form of the Greek name ''Nikolaos'' meaning "victory of the people".
*The name ''Flamel'' means in Old French "flame". Such meaning can be associated to Flamel's work as an alchemist.

==Behind the scenes==
*{{wplink|Nicolas Flamel}} was a real French scribe believed in legend to have been an alchemist who created the Philosopher's Stone. He was born about [[1330]] and died in [[1418]]. There is no proof that the historical Flamel and his wife {{W|Perenelle Flamel|Perenelle}} achieved immortality, though a few have claimed to have seen him throughout the centuries, or that he was even involved in alchemy at all. According to the legend, another of Flamel's goals was to turn ordinary lead into pure gold. However, while the Flamels had a reputation as generous benefactors, Nicolas's will did not indicate the fantastic wealth later ascribed to him. Historically that wealth was generally derived from Nicolas's businesses and Perenelle's inheritance from two previous husbands.
*The legend of Flamel as an immortal alchemist probably dates to 17th century. The reference to Flamel marks one of the few occasions in which a real person has been referenced as a character in the Potter books.
*In {{PS|FA}}, Flamel's first name is spelled as Nicholas, adding an ''h'' in the subtitles and in the book [[Hermione Granger]] reads.
*Also in the film, [[Harry Potter]], [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]], and [[Hermione Granger]] discover the link to Nicolas Flamel and the stone through a book, rather than [[Albus Dumbledore]]'s [[Chocolate Frog Card]]. In a deleted scene you see them discovering the connection through a chocolate frog card, but this was switched when edited.
*''Nicolas Flamel'' is the title of chapter 13 in {{PS}}.
*In a deleted first draft of {{PS}}, Harry says that Nicolas Flamel was spotted in a Parisian [[Parisian opera house|opera house]] in [[1762]]. Whether this is [[canon]] is unknown.<ref name="early">''"Very early page of Philosopher's Stone"'', by [[J. K. Rowling]] - {{see image|File:Very early page of Philosopher's Stone.jpg}}</ref>
* Nicolas was the first known Beauxbatons student introduced in the series, though the fact that he attended Beauxbatons was only revealed on Pottermore.
*Nicolas Flamel appeared in the [[Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald|second film]] of the ''[[Fantastic Beasts (film series)|Fantastic Beasts]]'' [[Fantastic Beasts (film series)|series]], portrayed by [[Brontis Jodorowsky]].<ref>[https://www.pottermore.com/news/next-fantastic-beasts-film-reveals-new-characters-including-nicolas-flamel Pottermore: Nicolas Flamel Cast]</ref>
*The pronunciation of Flamel's first name varies by canon source. While the s is articulated in the Harry Potter films, in {{COG}}, Nicolas himself uses the French pronunciation with a silent s.

=== Author's comments===
[[J. K. Rowling]] related that several months into the writing of {{PS}}, she had a highly detailed and exceptionally vivid dream about Flamel, which was like "''a renaissance painting come to life''". Flamel was leading her around his cluttered laboratory, which was bathed in golden light, and showing exactly how to make the Stone.<ref name="pottermore">{{WW|nicolas-flamel}}</ref>
