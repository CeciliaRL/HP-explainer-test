==Behind the scenes==
[[File:Screenshot 1065.png|165x165px|thumb|left]]
*'Mulpepper' seems to be a reference to [[Wikipedia:Nicholas Culpeper|Nicholas Culpeper]], an English botanist and pharmacologist who was accused of witchcraft after angering his fellow physicians by condemning their greed and their use of harmful practises such as toxic remedies and bloodletting. A revolutionary, Culpeper was able to provide his services for free. This, and a willingness to examine patients in person rather than simply examining their urine created an affray between him and the Society of Apothecaries, who were similarly incensed by the fact that he suggested cheap herbal remedies as opposed to their expensive concoctions.
