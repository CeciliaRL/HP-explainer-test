'''Galvin Gudgeon''' was a [[Wizardkind|wizard]] who was the [[Seeker]] for the [[Chudley Cannons]]<ref name="DP" /> [[Quidditch]] [[Quidditch team|team]] in the [[1990s]]. Whilst playing in a match against the [[Tutshill Tornados]], Gudgeon fell off his [[Broomstick]] trying to catch a passing bumble-bee.<ref name="DP" />

In [[1998]] he performed terribly when the Cannons were defeated by the [[Appleby Arrows]]. During the game, the [[Golden Snitch|Snitch]] bounced off his nose twice. Cannons manager [[Ragmar Dorkins]] felt he had to tell the team's fans that "turning him into a toad will not help his game."<ref name="DP">''[[The Daily Prophet (real-world)|Daily Prophet Newsletters]]: [[31 July]], [[1998]], Page 2''</ref>
