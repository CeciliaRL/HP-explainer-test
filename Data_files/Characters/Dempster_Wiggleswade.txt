{{Quote|Dear Buckley,<br>No, the Ministry of Magic would not turn a blind eye if you turn your nieces and nephews into blood-sucking ferrets. We will arrest you and you will probably find yourself in Azkaban. I advise you to call a halt to this feud before somebody gets hurt. In the meantime, contact the Office for the Removal of Curses, Jinxes and Hexes, who will take care of both the broomstick and your brother.|Dempster Wiggleswade's reply on the Problem Page of the Daily Prophet.|Daily Prophet Newsletters}}
