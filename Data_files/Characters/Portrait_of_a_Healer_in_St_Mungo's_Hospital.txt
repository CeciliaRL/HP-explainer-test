==Biography==
He diagnosed [[Ronald Weasley|Ron Weasley]] with [[Spattergroit]] during a visit to the hospital at [[Christmas]] in [[December]] [[1995]], given the "unsightly blemishes" on his skin that would leave him uglier than he already was. The portrait suggested that Ron "take the [[Toad liver|liver of a toad]], bind it tight about his throat and stand naked by the full [[moon]] in a barrel of [[Eel eye|eels' eyes]]" as a [[Cure for Spattergroit|cure]]. Ron took this diagnosis as a great offence, and countered that they were only freckles.<ref name="OOTP23">{{OOTP|B|23}}</ref>
