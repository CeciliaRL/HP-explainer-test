This individual was a British wizard who owned the Broom Shop in Diagon Alley by 1991.
He was a blond man with blue eyes and a moustache, and often wore blue robes. He was a polite man, as he would let first year students browse around his shop, even though he refused to sell them anything, as broomsticks are contraband for first years at Hogwarts.
