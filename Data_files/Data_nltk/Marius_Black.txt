Marius Black was the third child of Cygnus Black II and Violetta Bulstrode, and brother of Pollux Black, Cassiopeia Black, and Dorea Black. Marius was disowned and removed from the Black family tree tapestry for being born a Squib, a wizard-born person with no magical abilities. The Blacks were likely ashamed of his status, as Squibs are considered second-class citizens in the wizarding world and disregarded.
Marius's date of birth is unknown, but given when his siblings were born, Marius was likely born between 1915 and 1920.


== Etymology ==
Marius is a Roman name derived from Mars, the Roman god of war. It was the name of several Roman generals, a philosopher, and an emperor. One of those Roman generals was renowned for his revolutionary military reforms and for being elected consul an unprecedented seven times. The name is also sometimes used as a masculine version of the name Maria, which is derived from the Hebrew name Miriam, the meaning of which is usually theorised to be "sea of bitterness", or, alternatively, derived from the ancient egyptic mry; beloved, or mr; love. Marius is also the name of one of the main characters in Victor Hugo's Les Mis√©rables.
Marius is also the name of a moon crater , which fits in with the Black family tradition of naming children after stars.
