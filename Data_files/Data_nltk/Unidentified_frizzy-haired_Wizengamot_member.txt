This individual was a witch and member of the Wizengamot in the mid-1990s. She had frizzy-hair. On 12 August, she was present at Harry Potter's disciplinary hearing, appearing sceptical of Arabella Figg's testimony, smirking and nodding to the wizard sitting next to her's whispers. She and her neighbour later voted in favour of Harry's conviction.
