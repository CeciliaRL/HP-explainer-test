The Troll in the Underground Chambers was a mountain troll used by Quirinus Quirrell to guard the Philosopher's Stone during the 1991â€“1992 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


== History ==
It was the obstacle of Quirinus Quirrell in the Underground Chambers. It was in between Minerva McGonagall's giant chess set and Severus Snape's potion riddle.
On 4 June 1992, after Harry Potter and Hermione Granger mastered the Chessboard, they entered the room containing this troll, only to find it completely knocked out with a bloody stump on its head. They were both very glad to have avoided facing the troll themselves, allowing them to continue with their quest.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the book and GBC video game, the troll has already collapsed on the floor when Harry and Hermione get there, courtesy of Quirrell. However, in the PS1 game adaptation, the troll wakes up when Harry and Hermione get there. The troll is still groggy so while Hermione tries to unlock the next door, Harry levitates the litter present in the room from out of the troll's way, without making noise. The troll doesn't notice a hole on the floor and falls into it.
The troll and the room it guards is completely omitted from the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
