Angus Fleet was a Muggle who lived in Peebles, Scotland. On 1 September, 1992, the Daily Prophet reported that Fleet spotted a Ford Anglia in flight, and informed the police of the sighting.


== Behind the scenes ==
Angus Fleet was presumably one of the Muggles that Molly Weasley mentioned to her son Ron, saying that he caused Arthur Weasley to face an inquiry at work.
In the Norwegian translation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets he's from Glasgow.


== Etymology ==
The name "Angus" possibly means "one strength" derived from Irish Ã³en "one" and gus "force, strength, energy". Aonghus (sometimes surnamed Mac Og meaning "young son") was the Irish god of love and youth. The name was also borne by an 8th-century Pictish king and several Irish kings.
