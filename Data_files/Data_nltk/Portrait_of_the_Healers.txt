A group of six medieval Healers was immortalised on a portrait hung at the Grand Staircase at Hogwarts Castle. A human skeleton was also included in the portrait. The portrait was placed near the Fat Lady, on the seventh-floor level.


== History ==


=== Attack of the Fat Lady ===

On the 31st of October 1993, Sirius Black attacked Fat Lady's portrait on a failed attempt to gain entrance to Gryffindor Tower. The Healers most likely witnessed the attack, as they had horrified looks on their faces afterwards.


=== Dolores Umbridge as Headmistress of Hogwarts ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Filch removing the portrait from the Grand Staircase 		 	 
Dolores Umbridge replaced Albus Dumbledore as Head of Hogwarts School in 1996. One of her first actions as Headmistress was getting rid of all the portraits at the Grand Staircase. The Healers' was one, if not the last, to be removed. Argus Filch, the caretaker, removed the portrait off the wall, and carelessly handled it, causing the group of Healers to fall as he laughed. With the reinstatement of Dumbledore as Headmaster at the end of the school year, all the portraits were hung again, including the Healers'.


== Behind the scenes ==
The Healers were portrayed by David Heyman, David Barron, Lionel Wigram, Tim Lewis, Lorne Orleans, and John Trehy in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
These individuals may have died sometime prior to 1993, as many portraits hung at Hogwarts Castle depict deceased individuals.
David Heyman, the producer of the Harry Potter film series played as one of them in a cameo.
