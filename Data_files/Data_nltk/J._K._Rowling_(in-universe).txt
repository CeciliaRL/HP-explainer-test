J. K. Rowling authored Wizards' Book and the 2008 edition of The Tales of Beedle the Bard. Along with Comic Relief, she set up a fund in Harry Potter's name for proceeds from the sales of special copies of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages to be used to help struggling children worldwide.
