Nellie Lo Russell was an American No-Maj woman in the early 20th century.
Mrs Russell testified during the trial of Mrs Hall for the 14 September 1926 murders of her husband Reverend Hall and Mrs Mills. She stated that, on the night of 14 September, Mrs Gibson had visited her, and had also spent time at her own home.  This seemed to disprove Mrs Gibson's claim to have sighted Mrs Hall in De Russey Lane with a male companion, presumed to have been her accomplice, on the night of the murders. However, testimony from George Sipel apparently discredited Mrs Russell's alternate testimony. The trial was reported on in the 6 December 1926 issue of the New York Chronicle.


== Behind the scenes ==
The text of the article mentioning Nellie Lo Russell in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was taken from the real 21 November 1922 issue of The Evening World. This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in 1926, but the actual events referenced occurred in 1922.
