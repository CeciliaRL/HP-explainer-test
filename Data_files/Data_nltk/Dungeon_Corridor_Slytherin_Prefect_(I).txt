This wizard attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was a member of Slytherin House.


== Biography ==
In his fifth year, he was made a Prefect, and, during the 1993â€“1994 school year, he often patrolled the Dungeon Corridor outside the Potions Dungeon with a fellow Slytherin Prefect.
He was in on Draco Malfoy's plan of stealing the Quidditch crate from Rolanda Hooch's office and switching it with one with jinxed balls. He informed Malfoy after a Potions lesson that Marcus Flint and Peregrine Derrick that they had acted on his plan and hidden the real crate in the Clock Tower Courtyard. They then proceeded to the Quidditch stadium.


== Behind the scenes ==
As Draco implied that the prefect was part of the Slytherin Quidditch team, as well as the fact that he knew about Draco's plan and that Flint and Derrick had acted upon it, it is possible that he was Adrian Pucey or Graham Montague, whom he was similar in appearance to.
The prefect was voiced by Lewis MacLeod in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
