The father of Kevin was a wizard. He attended the Quidditch World Cup final in 1994 with his wife and two-year-old son named Kevin, staying in a large, pyramid-shaped tent. Early in the morning, his young son got hold of his wand, and played with it outside the family's tent. His wife caught the boy in the act, and, from the way she scolded him, it was apparent that this was not the first time something like this had happened.
