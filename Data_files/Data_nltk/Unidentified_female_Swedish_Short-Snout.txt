This unidentified Swedish Short-Snout was the female dragon that Cedric Diggory had to get by in the First Task of the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. 
He Transfigured a rock into a dog to distract the dragon and allow him to retrieve the golden egg that it was guarding. Unfortunately the dragon changed its mind partway through Diggory's attempt and attacked. He escaped with the egg but was burned by dragon fire and needed to be healed by Madam Pomfrey in the Hospital Wing.
