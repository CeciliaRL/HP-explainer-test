An African prince allegedly gifted Quirinus Quirrell with a turban as a token of his gratitude after the professor had rid him of a bothersome zombie. However, Quirrell's first year Defence Against the Dark Arts students in the 1991â€“1992 school year were unsure if they believed his story or not.


== Behind the scenes ==
Although Quirinus Quirrell claimed to have received his turban from this individual, Quirrell used the turban to hide the face of Lord Voldemort on the back of his head. Therefore, it is possible that this individual does not exist, particularly as there are no wizarding princes, and it would be odd if a Muggle prince knew about a zombie. Additionally, zombies are known to be native to the United States of America, as opposed to the continent of Africa.
