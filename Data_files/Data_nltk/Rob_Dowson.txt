Rob Dowson was a wizard reported missing along with his relative, Ellie, on the Potterwatch radio programme in 1997. His disappearance was most likely linked to a Death Eater attack.


== Etymology ==
The name "Robert" is from the Germanic name Hrodebert meaning "bright fame", derived from the Germanic elements hrod "fame" and beraht "bright". The Normans introduced this name to Britain, where it replaced the Old English cognate Hreodbeorht. It has been a very common English name since that time.


== Behind the scenes ==
This character is presumably a tribute to a relative of Mike Dowson, a sound mixer who worked on the final three Harry Potter films.
