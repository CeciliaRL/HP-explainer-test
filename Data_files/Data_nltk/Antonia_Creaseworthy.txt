Dame Antonia Creaseworthy was a witch who lived in the 17th century.. There were two portraits of her at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She served as Headmistress of Hogwarts at an unknown point in time.


== Biography ==
Creaseworthy lived during the 17th century. During her life, she earned the title "Dame," the female equivalent of the honour of knighthood in Great Britain.
Her name was carved into a wood panel on the wall of Professor Trelawney's Divination classroom at some point.
In the winter of 1993, Creaseworthy's name appeared on the Marauder's Map, possibly indicating that she was still alive at this point, or lingering at Hogwarts as a ghost.
Two portraits of Creaseworthy were hung within Hogwarts Castle sometime after her death. One was a full-body portrait painted in 1624, in which Creaseworthy was depicted as wearing an orange robe and leaning on a chair. The other was a small portrait in which Creaseworthy was depicted as wearing a blue dress, green shawl/robe, and feathered headdress.
