President Emily Rappaport was an American witch who served as President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America in the late 18th century.


== Biography ==
Rappaport was the fifteenth person to be elected to the office of President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America.
Rappaport's term saw one of the greatest ever breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy. Dorcus Twelvetrees, the daughter of Rappaport's Keeper of Treasure and Dragots, Aristotle Twelvetrees, revealed the locations of both the MACUSA headquarters and Ilvermorny, as well as information on how the wizarding community sought to hide itself, to a No-Maj with whom she was infatuated, Bartholomew Barebone. Barebone, a Scourer descendant, firmly believed in the existence of magic, and that witches and wizards should be destroyed. He thus stole Dorcus's wand and sought to publicise all of the details about the wizarding world which she had told him.
The fallout of this incident was profound. The MACUSA was forced to relocate its headquarters because of all the No-Maj attention drawn to it and faced "humiliating" censure by the International Confederation of Wizards. Rappaport was required to testify before the ICW at a public inquiry, and admitted to them that she could not be certain that all No-Majs exposed to the leaked information had been Obliviated.
In 1790, Rappaport enacted Rappaport's Law, which created total segregation between the magic and non-magic communities in the United States by banning wizards and witches from marrying or befriending No-Majs, restricting them to interactions "necessary to perform daily activities."
