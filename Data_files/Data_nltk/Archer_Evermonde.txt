Minister Archer Evermonde was Minister for Magic from 1912 to 1923. He was ultimately elected at least twice.


== Biography ==
During Minister Evermonde's term, the Muggle world became involved in a large-scale military conflict that became known as the First World War. Evermonde was responsible for passing emergency legislation forbidding wizards and witches to get involved, in an attempt to prevent mass breaches of the International Statue of Secrecy. 
This did not prevent thousands of wizards from aiding Muggles discreetly and where they could. For these actions, Minister Evermonde earned Wizengamot member Henry Potter's public condemnation, which caused a minor stir at the time.
Some wizards, like Theseus Scamander directly served, in apparent defiance of Evermonde's legislation.
