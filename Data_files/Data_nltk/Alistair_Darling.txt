Alistair Darling was a British politician and Chancellor of the Exchequer in the mid-to-late 1990s. In July of 1996, Darling announced "controversial changes" to the capital gains tax. As the protests grew louder, shadow chancellor George Osborne said his party would be campaigning to overturn this measure. These events were covered by The Guardian. He was also one of the many people who attempted to have the portrait in the Prime Minister's office removed, although he like all of the others failed to do so.


== Behind the scenes ==
The listing of Alistair Darling as the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1996 is anachronistic, as Darling was only appointed to the office in 2007. Indeed, at the time, was a member of Tony Blair's Shadow Cabinet as the Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
