Eduardus Limus was a Ministry of Magic employee, who worked as Exotic Symbol Analyst for the Minister for Magic's Support Staff.


== Behind the scenes ==
Eduardus Limus is named after Eduardo Lima, one of the graphic artists that produced many of the paper props seen in the Harry Potter films.
If Rufus Scrimgeour took any notice of the sign of the Deathly Hallows in Albus Dumbledore's old copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard upon confiscating the objects the late Headmaster left to the Trio in his will, he presumably tasked Mr Limus with figuring out its meaning. If this is the case, it was presumably to no avail, seeing as Scrimgeour would primarily focus on opening the Golden Snitch. Alternatively, Mr Limus did indeed recognise the symbol for what it was, with Scrimgeour dismissing "The Tale of the Three Brothers" and its associated artefacts as superstition and myth.
