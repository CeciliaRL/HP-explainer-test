These two women were the older Squib sisters of Gilderoy Lockhart.


== Biography ==
They are the daughters of Mr Lockhart, a Muggle, and Mrs Lockhart, a witch. Their mother doted on Gilderoy due to his magical powers and treated him as her unashamed favourite, which implies she neglected her daughters to some degree; being Squibs may have influenced her thoughts on them, as squibs are commonly looked down on in the wizarding community.
The Healer who looked after Lockhart, Miriam Strout, stated in December 1995 that he never got visitors at St Mungo's. This could mean that Lockhart's sisters were either deceased by then, or simply did not wish to see their brother.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is rare for squibs, even one, to be born into a magical lineage. The fact that these two out of three Lockhart siblings are squibs is noteworthy.
