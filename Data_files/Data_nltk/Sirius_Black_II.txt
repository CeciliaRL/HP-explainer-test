Sirius Black II (1877 â€“ 1952) was a pure-blood wizard, the eldest son of Phineas Nigellus Black and Ursula Flint, and brother of Phineas, Cygnus Black II, Belvina and Arcturus; husband of Hesper Gamp, father of Arcturus Black III, Lycoris, and Regulus, and great-grandfather of Sirius Black and Regulus Arcturus Black (and namesake of the former).
He was depicted on the Black family tree tapestry.


== Behind the scenes ==
Based on a statement by Horace Slughorn, Sirius may have been a member of the Slytherin House. That would make him the only Sirius Black who was sorted into Slytherin house; his uncle Sirius Black I died before going to Hogwarts and Sirius Black III was sorted into Gryffindor house. However, he attended Hogwarts c. 1888 - 1895, when Slughorn was not the Potions teacher. However seeing that Slughorn was born somewhere between 1882 and 1913 and if he was born in the former, Slughorn and Sirius would have been in school together with Sirius being in his third or fourth year.
Sirius II had the same name as his paternal uncle who died very young.
Sirius II named his son Arcturus, the same as his brother and his great uncle.


== Etymology ==
Sirius is the name of the Dog Star (Alpha Canis Majoris), which with an apparent magnitude of -1.46 is the brightest star in the night sky.
