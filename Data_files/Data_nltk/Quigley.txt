Quigley was an Irish wizard who played as the Beater for the Irish National Quidditch team during the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.


== Biography ==
He played in the final against Bulgaria in which he struck a Bludger towards Bulgaria's Viktor Krum, breaking the Seeker's nose. His side won and he and Troy lifted the Quidditch World Cup aloft in the stadium's Top Box.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is possible that this Beater is Finbar Quigley, who plays for the Ballycastle Bats, as they share the same last name and Ballycastle could refer to either the small town in Northern Ireland or the village in the Republic of Ireland. If so, it is likely that he plays Beater for the Ballycastle Bats.
