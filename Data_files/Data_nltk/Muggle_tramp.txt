This Muggle tramp was killed by Tom Marvolo Riddle in order for him to turn Salazar Slytherin's locket into a Horcrux.


== Behind the scenes ==
Albus Dumbledore speculated that Voldemort was reserving the creation of his Horcruxes via significant murders. This means that this individual played an important role in Voldemort's life, or that Dumbledore's speculation was incorrect (as he admitted he was not perfect, proven with his incorrect belief that Voldemort used Frank Bryce's murder to create his final Horcrux when it was in fact Bertha Jorkins).
