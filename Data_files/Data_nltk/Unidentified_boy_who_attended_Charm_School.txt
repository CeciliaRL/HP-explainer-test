=== Early life ===

This individual was born somewhere in the British Isles in around 1979 or 1980, to a former Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts. He was apparently born into a half-blood family, as he appeared to have some contact with the Muggle society. Sometime in his childhood, he attended Charm School.


=== Hogwarts years ===

He started at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991, and hoped to be Sorted into his father's old house, but was Sorted in Slytherin instead. In his first week of classes, he commented that his old Charm School was nothing like Professor Flitwick's Charms classes.
