This individual was a wizard and a former Head of Gryffindor House who had a portrait of himself hung in the Gryffindor Common Room.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
This individual was born in either Great Britain or Ireland, sometime before 1974. He attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth, and was sorted into Gryffindor House.


=== Later life ===
Sometime after his graduation, he returned to Hogwarts and became the Head of Gryffindor House. He had a portrait of himself hung in his house's common room, depicting him wearing a navy-blue coat and standing against a red background, with the Hogwarts crest printed beside his head. He had, unfortunately, died by 1991.


=== Post-mortem ===
The wizard's portrait remained, and in 1994, he was terrified by Harry Potter opening his wailing gold egg, holding his hands over his ears in agony. 
The next year, he wondered what Godric Gryffindor would say if he were still alive, perhaps indicating a dislike for that generation.


== Physical appearance ==
This wizard was tall and had a serious face; it was quite tan. He had dark, narrow eyes similar to Phineas Nigellus Black's, and a long black beard with matching hair, both having silver streaks in them.


== Personality and traits ==
He was, if his house indicated his personality, a brave man, who was very loyal, nervous, and chivalrous. He had plenty courage and daring, and obviously was deemed to be worth following, given his appointment as Head of House. However, he was also slightly snide and critical, telling sarcastic jokes about the Fat Lady, even though she did not like this and asked him not to.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, he was credited as GCR Portrait Male 3, and was voiced by Jonathan Kydd. His portrait also appears in the Gryffindor Common Room in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, but does not speak.
