Professor Benedita Dourado was a South American witch and a former Headmistress of Castelobruxo.


== Biography ==
She went on an exchange visit to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry sometime during Professor Armando Dippet's tenure as Head of Hogwarts. When Dippet complained of Peeves, the resident poltergeist, Professor Dourado laughed heartily and offered to send him some Caipora for the Forbidden Forest "to show [him] what trouble really is." Professor Dippet did not take her up on this offer.


== Etymology ==
Benedita is the feminine form of Benedito, which is the Portuguese form of Benedict. "Benedita" comes from the Latin "bene" (well) and "dicere" (to speak), and it means "(she who is) blessed"; the same etymon also originated the English word "benediction".
"Dourado" means "golden" in Portuguese, and it is not a fairly common surname in either Brazil or Portugal.
