George III (full name George William Frederick; 4 June, 1738 â€“ 29 January, 1820), was King of Great Britain and Ireland from 25 October, 1760 to 29 January, 1820.
He ruled the United Kingdom during the Revolutionary War, a notable military conflict between the non-magical peoples of Britain and (what would eventually become) the United States; neither wizarding government (British Ministry of Magic, led by Minister Crowdy, or the MACUSA, led by President McGilliguddy) officially intervened.
King George suffered from mental illness in his later years. In 1782, the Prime Minister at the time, Lord North, confidentially reached out to then-Minister for Magic Porteus Knatchbull to see if he could help with the king's condition. However, this resulted in a rumour spreading that Lord North believed in wizards, triggering a motion of no confidence that forced his resignation.
