This family was a Muggle one, comprised of a couple and two children. They resided in a house in Budleigh Babberton.


== History ==
In 1996, while these Muggles were on holiday in the Canary Islands, Horace Slughorn hid in their home from Death Eaters attempting to recruit him.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the novel, the narrator tells us that "If Harry had not known who lived there, he would have guessed at a rich, fussy old lady", given the contents of the house: soft chairs and footstools, drinks and books, boxes of chocolates and plump cushions. It is unknown if the furniture belonged to these Muggles or if it was Slughorn's, as he was known to bring at least some furniture with him (i.e. the grand piano).
