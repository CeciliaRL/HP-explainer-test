Mrs Polkiss was the mother of Piers Polkiss.


== Biography ==
She brought her son to 4 Privet Drive for a birthday outing with Dudley Dursley in 1991. In 1995, Dudley told his mother, Petunia, that he was going out for tea at the Polkisses', when in fact he was planning to cause trouble with his gang of friends.
As Vernon Dursley's initial reaction to the aftermath of Dudley's Dementor attack was that Mrs Polkiss had served something foreign for tea, it is a possibility that Mrs Polkiss has a fondness for international dishes. However, it is more likely that this comment was merely an example of Vernon's ignorance, and completely unrelated to anything that Vernon may have known about Mrs Polkiss.
