This wizard (d. 2 May 1998) was a Death Eater that fought during the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998 and was killed during the battle. Before that, he was seen as the Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort first attacked the castle and broke down the defences. He was also seen towards the end of the battle. He was one of the Death Eaters who had tied up Hagrid while he held the "dead" body of Harry Potter. He was killed later during the second part of the battle.
