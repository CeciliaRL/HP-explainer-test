Arcturus Black (1835 – 1893) was a pure-blood wizard. He was an early member of the House of Black, and it is possible that he was the brother of Cygnus and Misapinoa, and uncle of Phineas Nigellus (and his siblings Sirius, Elladora, and Iola).


== Etymology ==
Arcturus is a name of the fourth brightest star in the sky and the brightest star in the constellation Boötes, it is approximately 36 light-years from Earth. There were other Blacks with the name Arcturus, Arcturus Black II and Arcturus Black III.

== Behind the scenes ==
Based on a statement by Horace Slughorn, Arcturus may have graduated at Hogwarts and was sorted into Slytherin house. However, he attended Hogwarts c. 1846 - 1853, when Slughorn wasn't even born.
This character appears only on the version of the Black family tree shown in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. He was not included on the version of the tree which J. K. Rowling gave to a charity auction in 2006. However, according to director David Yates, Rowling provided the filmmakers with a copy of the Black family tree going back eight generations. The filmmakers presumably received a more complete version of the tree than the one auctioned off, which only goes back six generations.
Cygnus Black I was possibly his older brother. It's possible that Arcturus' great nephew is named after him.
