Emeric the Evil was a short-lived but exceptionally aggressive Dark Wizard from the Middle Ages.


== Biography ==
During his lifetime, he was once the master of the Elder Wand. With it, he terrorised the south of England in the early Middle Ages. He was "slaughtered" in a ferocious duel against Egbert the Egregious.
During their History of Magic lessons with Professor Binns at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, first year students often mixed up Emeric the Evil with Uric the Oddball. The seventh year History of Magic curriculum also covered Emeric the Evil, at least in the 1990â€“1991 school year.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Dark Arts: Emeric the Evil was a profilic Dark Wizard who would have been accomplished with dark magic, likely including the casting of dark charms. It is said that he terrorised Southern England in the early Middle Ages, which he likely did using the Dark Arts.
Duelling: Having gained ownership of the legendary Elder Wand, Emeric was an aggressive wizard with a proclivity for duelling and martial magic; however, he was defeated and killed in a duel with Egbert the Egregious, meaning he was an inferior duellist to him.
Care of Magical Creatures: Emeric was capable of flying a dragon-like creature, an extremely dangerous looking magical beast, showing he was to an extent skilled with taming and controlling it.


== Etymology ==
The name "Emeric" is a Germanic name, in which the second element is ric meaning "power". The first element may be ermen "whole, universal" (making it a relative of Ermenrich), amal "work, labour" (making it a relative of Amalric) or heim "home" (making it a relative of Henry). It is likely that several forms merged into a single name.


== Behind the scenes ==
In The Tales of Beedle the Bard: Illustrated Edition, Chris Riddell depicts Emeric the Evil riding an unnamed dragon-like creature, which is unnamed in the text, it is only shown in the illustration of him. This is not stated in the original version of The Tales of Beedle the Bard either. The nature of this dragon is also unknown.
