Agatha Timms was a witch who owned an eel farm.


== Biography ==
At the Quidditch World Cup in 1994, she bet Ludo Bagman that the match would last a week, wagering 50% co-ownership of her farm.
Ludo referred to her as "little Agatha Timms," presumably indicating that she was either diminutive in stature, or much younger than him.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the early German translation, Agatha owns an owl farm, in later editions corrected to eel farm.


== Etymology ==
The name "Agatha" is the Latinized form of the Greek name Αγαθη (Agathe), derived from Greek αγαθος (agathos) meaning "good". Saint Agatha was a 3rd-century martyr from Sicily who was tortured and killed after spurning the advances of a Roman official. The saint was widely revered in the Middle Ages, and her name has been used throughout Christian Europe (in various spellings). The mystery writer Agatha Christie (1890-1976) was a famous modern bearer of this name.
