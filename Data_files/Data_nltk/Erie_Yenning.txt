Erie Yenning (fl. 2003) was a British wizard or witch who worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office at the Ministry of Magic.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Born somewhere in the British Isles, Erie Yenning was the scion of a family of unknown wizarding descent. Like most other magical children born in the wizarding community of Great Britain, they presumably attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during their formative years, and may have chosen to take Muggle Studies, given their future occupation.


=== Working for the Ministry ===
Sometime after they turned seventeen, Erie joined the Ministry of Magic in London and became an Officer in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, in which capacity they worked for the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office along with others such as Myra Curio. While not as involved with the Statute of Secrecy Task Force as said colleague, Erie did become friendly with at least one of its members, whom they encountered at the Ministry during working hours. At some point, Yenning gifted this Calamity Investigator with a set of Dragon-fire tampered, Muggle-made cauldrons that allowed for super-heated potion-making, which, while they normally would destroy most potions during the brewing process, proved to increase the effectiveness of the Potent Exstimulo Potion.
