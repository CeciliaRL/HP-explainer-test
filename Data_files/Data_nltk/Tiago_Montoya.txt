Tiago Montoya was a Spanish wizard who played as a Beater on the Spanish National Quidditch team in 1994.
During the 1996–1997 school year, Montoya's Chocolate Frog Card could be won by beating Gladys Prescott at a Quidditch challenge.


== Etymology ==
Tiago is Portuguese for "James". Montoya is a common Spanish surname derived from "monte", the Spanish word for hill.
Together with teammate Iñigo Fuente, this character's name may be a reference to Íñigo Montoya from the fantasy comedy romance novel (and film) The Princess Bride.
