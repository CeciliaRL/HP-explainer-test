Loxias was a Dark wizard who became Master of the Elder Wand after he murdered Barnabas Deverill. Loxias gave it the name of "the Deathstick", and used it to vanquish his enemies. It is unknown who killed him, as - according to Albus Dumbledore - many claimed to have finished him off, including his own mother, but from Xenophilius Lovegood's understanding of history, either Arcus or Livius seems to have done it, and thus became the next master of the Elder Wand.
