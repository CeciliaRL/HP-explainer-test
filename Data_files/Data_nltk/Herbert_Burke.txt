Herbert Burke was a wizard who married the pure-blood witch Belvina Black. Given that Belvina was not disowned by her family, who believed strongly in blood purity, it is likely that Herbert was a pure-blood. The couple had two sons and one daughter. Herbert may be related to Caractacus Burke of Borgin and Burkes.


== Etymology ==
"Herbert" is derived from the Germanic elements hari, "army" and beraht, "bright". The Normans introduced this name to England, where it replaced an Old English cognate Herebeorht. In the course of the Middle Ages it became rare, but it was revived in the 19th century.
There was a real person with this name, J. Herbert Burke.
Burke means "fortified hill".
