Father Christmas (also known as Santa Claus or simply Santa) is a mythological figure associated with Christmas, who is typically portrayed as a jolly old man with a long, white beard.


== History ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			A Father Christmas statue on display at Ginzberg Delaunay in December 1926 		 	 
A statue of Father Christmas was on display at the Ginzberg Delaunay department store in New York in December 1926.
Ronald Weasley remarked that the Muggle perception of garden gnomes resembled traditional depictions of Father Christmas while real gnomes looked quite different.
Rubeus Hagrid was described as presenting his idea of having the students in Care of Magical Creatures class come down on alternate evenings to observe the Blast-Ended Skrewts and make notes about their extraordinary behaviour "with the air of Father Christmas pulling an extra-large toy out of his sack."
In December 1995, while Harry Potter was staying at 12 Grimmauld Place at over the Christmas holidays, an enchanted father christmas toy on a broomstick flew around the house. The stuffed house-elf heads on the walls of the stairs leading to the upper floor were also adorned with "Father Christmas hats and beards."


== Behind the scenes ==
The U.S. edition of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets published by Scholastic uses the name "Santa Claus".
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 the 12 Grimmauld Place model has LEGO-Albus Dumbledore like traits.
There is a widely-discussed theory (attributed to redditor TheSortingSombrero) that Father Christmas is a wizard, that he uses Floo Powder to get down the fireplaces, that he uses a Time-Turner to get his presents delivered in one night and has the Philosopher's Stone to be immortal and to pay for the presents.
