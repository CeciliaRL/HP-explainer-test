Richard Washburn Child (5 August 1881 â€“ 31 January 1935) was an American No-Maj author and diplomat.
He had been appointed as the U.S. ambassador to Italy by 1926. On 6 December of that year, he spoke at the plenary session of the Near East Peace Conference, explaining that the U.S. was "much interested" in observing settlement of the Near East, but was not authorised to join committees, sign reports, or vote on decisions.


== Behind the scenes ==
Richard Washburn Child served as the U.S. ambassador to Italy from May 1921 to February 1924 in real life. This makes the reference to him in an article in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them anachronistic, as the film is set in December 1926, two years after his ambassadorship ended. However, it can be presumed that Child's ambassadorship lasted longer in the Harry Potter universe, as did Harding's presidency.
The text of the article mentioning Child in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle was taken from the real 21 November 1922 issue of The Evening World and documents an actual historical event (albeit anachronistically).
