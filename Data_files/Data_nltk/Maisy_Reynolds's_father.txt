Mr Reynolds was the father of Maisy Reynolds.
At some point during the 1997-1998 school year, her daughter Maisy disobeyed Alecto Carrow, then a teacher at Hogwarts School, which made the Death Eater "pay a visit" to her father. Alecto Carrow would, afterwards, threaten to do it again if Maisy challenged her.
