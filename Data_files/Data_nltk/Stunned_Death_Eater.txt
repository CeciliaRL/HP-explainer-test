This Dark Wizard was a Death Eater who served Lord Voldemort during the Second Wizarding War.


== Biography ==
Born in or before the 1980s, most likely to a pure or half-blood family, he procured a wand and was trained in the magical arts, possibly at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
He met Tom Riddle sometime before May, and formally became a Death Eater and one of his loyal servants.
On the 1 May in 1998, this Death Eater was called upon to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts in Scotland.
Sometime throughout the battle, he was stunned by Harry Potter in the Viaduct Courtyard.
His fate is unclear, though it is probable that he was killed in battle, abandoned the battle or else captured and imprisoned in Azkaban for his crimes as a Death Eater.


== Physical appearance ==
This man had a small black moustache, short black hair, and narrow eyes. He was of an average height and build, with Caucasian skin flushed from the battle. He wore a pair of black boots and a black cape, as well as a shirt that, right before he was Stunned, shone brightly.


== Personality and traits ==
If his membership as a Death Eater reveals his personality, he was a cruel, sadistic individual and a pure-blood supremacist, with him also being cunning, yet not entirely as intelligent as other Death Eaters, as he was easily stunned by Harry Potter off-guard, implying he was perhaps somewhat inattentive.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Dark Arts: Being a Death Eater, he would have been an accomplished Dark Wizard who was highly proficient in dark magic and with the casting of dark charms, most likely including the Unforgivable Curses.
Duelling: As this Death Eater fought in the Battle of Hogwarts against the defenders of Hogwarts, he would have been a fairly competent duellist with some skill in martial magic, but he was not skilled enough to avoid being stunned off-guard by Harry Potter, a far superior duellist.
