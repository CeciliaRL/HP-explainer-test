The peasant woman's granddaughter was a character in the tale The Wizard and the Hopping Pot by Beedle the Bard. She was afflicted by a crop of warts. A kindly old wizard used to make a special poultice for her warts but, when he died, his son rudely refused to give her the potion. Later, when the Wizard could bear no more of his father's lucky cooking pot, he Vanished the little girl's warts in her sleep.
