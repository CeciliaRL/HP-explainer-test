Dean Thomas had several Muggle half-siblings. They were the children of Mr and Mrs Thomas, and grew up in London, England with their parents and half-brother.


== Biography ==
When Dean was forced to go on the run after the Muggle-Born Registration Commission was created in 1997, his parents and sisters were very worried about him. Potterwatch asked its listeners to pass on any news they might have about him.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is unknown how many half-siblings Dean had or any of their names. J. K. Rowling has only said that he has "a number of half-brothers and sisters."
Contrary to what J.K says, in the Deathly Hallows Lee Jordan says on Potterwatch that "his parents and sisters are desperate for news" meaning he could only have female half-sibling or that Lee knew only of his sisters and not his brothers. Or that his half-brothers do not know he's missing due their age.
