Radulf (fl. 12th century) was a wizard blacksmith who lived in the same village as Goodwin Kneen. After Gunhilda Kneen got a touch of Dragon Pox, Radulf was called in to play Catcher (Chaser) in a game of Kwidditch (Quidditch) against a team from Ilkley. During the game, he took a Blooder (Bludger) to the head when old Ugga failed to intercept it.
