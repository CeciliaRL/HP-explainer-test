Professor Valeria Myriadd was a witch and Head of Gryffindor House during her life. After she died, numerous portraits were hung of her at Hogwarts Castle.


== Biography ==


=== Life ===
Valeria was born someplace in either Great Britain or Ireland, and when she was eleven years old began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where she was sorted into Gryffindor House.
She graduated at the end of her seventh year with good enough grades that she could return as a professor, and eventually rose to the position of Head of Gryffindor House. She died sometime prior to September 1991.


=== 1991â€“1992 school year ===
By 1991, several portraits of Valeria hung at the main halls of Hogwarts Castle, such as the Grand Staircase. In Gryffindor Tower, one of her portraits guarded a secret passage to a disused bathroom. The password for said passage was "Pig Snout".


=== 1992-1993 school year ===
By the next school year, her place in the Gryffindor Tower had been taken by Oraclitus Spheer. Her portrait was moved to the Hogwarts Library Annexe, hiding a shortcut to a section containing the original hand-written manuscript of Hogwarts: A History, by Chroniculus Punnet. The password was "Bibliophile".


== Etymology ==
"Valeria" is the feminine form of the name "Valerius", who was a Roman saint in the second century. "Myriad" means "countless" or "extremely great in number".


== Behind the scenes ==
For reasons currently unknown, Myriadd's portrait was painted depicting her standing by some snowy mountains, with her wearing a dark blue, fur-lined cloak and holding a fairy.
