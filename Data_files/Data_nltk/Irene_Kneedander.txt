Irene Kneedander was an American witch and the Head of the Body for Protection of Magical Species during the late 1800s. She was deemed responsible for the Great Sasquatch Rebellion of 1892 by historians as her interpretation of her job title had involved attacking any Sasquatch that "stepped out of line."
