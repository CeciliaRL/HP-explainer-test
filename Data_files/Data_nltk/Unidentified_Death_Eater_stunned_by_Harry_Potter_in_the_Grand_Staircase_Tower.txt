== Biography ==
On 2 May 1998, this wizard was one of the first Death Eaters to break into Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry after the protective enchantments were broken. He was seen flying through the tower of the Grand Staircase, but was stunned by Harry Potter. The Death Eater subsequently collided with the pillars, possibly knocking himself out. It is unknown if he participated in the rest of the battle or if he survived. If he did, he would have likely been put in Azkaban for aiding Voldemort.
