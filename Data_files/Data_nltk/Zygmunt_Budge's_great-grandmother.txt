This witch (fl. c. 1500s) was the great-grandmother of Zygmunt Budge, one of the most accomplished Potioneers ever known. She was remembered by her great-grandson as a "distressingly giggly" persona, in sharp contrast to his own personality.
Budge's great-grandmother had an old recipe for the Laughing Potion that she handed down to him as a child. In his adult years in reclusion in the Isle of Hermetray, Budge set himself the challenge of refining that recipe. He later used it on a Muggle neighbour from the Isle of Harris who thought himself funny and was determined to make fun of him â€” a drink from Budge's potion made him laugh for a week straight, after which he retired to a silent monastery, having developed an aversion for all things funny.
