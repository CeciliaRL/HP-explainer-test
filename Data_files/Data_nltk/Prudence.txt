Prudence (fl. 1269), nicknamed Pru by her sister, was a Scot who lived in Aberdeen, Scotland during the 13th century. She was the sister of Modesty Rabnott, who she had received a letter from after she lost her home.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is possible her surname is "Rabnott" since this was her sister's surname and there was no mention of Modesty having a husband come with her. It is possible, however, that Prudence was married.
In 1269, the Statute of Secrecy did not exist, meaning that it is possible for Prudence to be a Muggle who knows about magic.
