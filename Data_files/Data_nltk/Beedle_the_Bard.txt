Beedle the Bard (fl. 15th century) was an English wizard and author of wizarding fairytales. Beedle was born in Yorkshire, England. At some point in his life he wrote The Tales of Beedle the Bard. Beedle wrote in ancient runes, which were later translated to English.
Taking his stories as an indicator of his opinions, he seemed to have held Muggles in higher esteem than most of his contemporaries. He also valued traits such as: kindness, common sense, and ingenuity.
