Thaddeus Thurkell (1632—1692) was a wizard who fathered seven sons who were all Squibs. He transfigured them into hedgehogs out of disgust.
The birth of a single Squib to a magical parent was known to be a rare event. This would seem to indicate that the case of the Thurkell family was quite exceptional, especially as it merited mention on a Chocolate Frog Card.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Transfiguration: Thaddeus successfully transformed his sons into Hedgehogs out of disgust for their Squib statuses. Given how both Human Transfiguration and Trans-Species Transformation are both highly advanced and complex forms of transfiguration, this is proof of skill in this field.


== Etymology ==
The name "Thaddeus" comes from Θαδδαιος (Thaddaios), the Greek form of the Aramaic name Thaddai. It is possibly derived from a word, meaning "heart", but it may in fact be an Aramaic form of a Greek name such as Theodoros.
