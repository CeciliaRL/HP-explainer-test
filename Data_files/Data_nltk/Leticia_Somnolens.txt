Leticia Somnolens was a Medieval hag known for conspiring against a princess, and apparently served as a source of inspiration for the Muggle fairy tale, Sleeping Beauty.

A spiteful and vicious creature, Somnolens was jealous of the daughter of the local King and tainted a spindle with the Draught of Living Death. She then tricked the young princess into pricking her finger on it, sending her into a deep sleep. Her plan was foiled, however, by a young wizard who smeared his lips with Wiggenweld Potion, and then kissed the princess, curing her and bringing her out of the sleep.
