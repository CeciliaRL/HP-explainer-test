Lucy Evans (born c. 1939) was a Muggle housewife, and a witness of the Millennium Bridge disaster in 1996, aged 57. She was standing on the riverbank directly beneath the bridge when the collapse took place. She later asserted to The Guardian that those responsible were, without a doubt, foreigners.


== Behind the scenes ==
Lucy Evans is presumably named after Lucy Evans, who worked as an assistant music supervisor on Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and as an assistant to David Barron on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.
Much like Mark Evans, Lucy is most likely not related to Lily Evans despite sharing a surname.
