Darren Floyd was a Welsh wizard and a Beater for the Welsh National Quidditch team in the 2014 Quidditch World Cup. During their match against Brazil, he single-handedly prevented at least seventeen Brazilian goals. 
After Brazil's victory, he had to help fellow Beater Iefan Rice drag their manager Gwenog Jones off the pitch after she attacked Brazilian manager Jos√© Barboza in retaliation for calling the Welsh Chasers "talentless hags".
