== Biography ==
In 1711, shortly after the change in colour of the Quaffle, Daisy invented a charm to slow the target's descent and used it on the Quaffle, allowing Chasers to retrieve the ball while it was still in the air rather than having to dive to the ground. These enchanted Quaffles became known as "Pennifold Quaffles" and are still used in modern times.
