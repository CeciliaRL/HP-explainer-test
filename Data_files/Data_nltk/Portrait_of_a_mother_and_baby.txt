This Portrait of a mother and baby hung beside the portrait of the Fat Lady at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The baby cried when the school found out what Sirius Black did to the portrait of the Fat Lady when he broke into the castle. Both mother and child were also distressed by the Fat Lady's horrible singing at the beginning of the school year.


== Behind the scenes ==
The portrait of the mother and baby in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was in fact a cameo appearance. The mother was portrayed by Annalisa Bugliani, and the baby by Tess Bu Cuarón.
