This individual (fl. 1996) was a wizard. He may have been a former member of the Slug Club, as in 20 December, 1996, he attended Professor Slughorn's Christmas party. He was most likely acquainted with a female Hogwarts teacher, as he stood with her at the party.


== Behind the scenes ==
This individual was played by an unknown actor in film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
Given that the female Hogwarts teacher, whom he stayed with during the Slug Club Christmas party, is depicted as wearing a wedding ring, this individual may be her husband. This is, of course, backed by no canon information, and should not be treated as fact.
