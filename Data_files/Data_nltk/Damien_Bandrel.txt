Damien Bandrel, also known by the nickname Black Scorpion, was an American wizarding criminal who operated in the 1920s.
In or around 1926, the Magical Congress of the United States of America issued a wanted poster for Bandrel, which stated that he was wanted for forging potions and spells and offered a 2500 dragot reward for his arrest.
