Alderton was a wizard living somewhere in the British Isles during the Second Wizarding War. Despite his claims to be half-blood, Alderton was 'interviewed' by the Muggle-Born Registration Commission on 2 September, 1997, and was either sent to Azkaban or stripped of his wand and job.


== History ==


=== Early life ===
According to Alderton, he was the son of William Alderton, a wizard, making him a half-blood. The Ministry of Magic, however, determined he was a Muggle-born wizard.
He most likely attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth.


=== Second Wizarding War and Prosecution ===
In 1997, after the infiltration of the Ministry of Magic by Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters, he was singled out as being Muggle-born by the Muggle-Born Registration Commission and was tried. He was found guilty during the trial and was therefore led away by two Ministry guards afterwards, either to await imprisonment or to be stripped of his wand and job. As he left the courtroom, he desperately tried to convince the guards that he was a half-blood by claiming that his father was a pure-blood wizard, but was unsuccessful. It is unknown what happened to him afterwards.


== Behind the scenes ==
He is played by Ned Dennehy and is credited as "Scared Man".
