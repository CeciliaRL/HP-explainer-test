Professor Fortinbras was a witch and Charms professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at some point between the 15th and 19th centuries.


== Biography ==
Fortinbras was a former Charms Master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, who taught sometime vaguely between the 15th century and 19th century. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington knew her, and she sometimes talked about the Cursed Vaults while he was listening. Sir Nicholas told Jacob's sibling and Angelica Cole about her in 1987. At some point in her teaching career, she came to believe (correctly) that the fabled Cursed Vaults were real and wrote her fears and suspicions about them in a folio that she left behind in her old classroom. At the time, teachers and students alike formed a 'circle of trust' that worked together in researching the vaults, with the Potions Master of the day, Professor Bartholomew, being her closest confidant. Her loyalty to him was such that she even sought to conceal his identity so that her colleague would not be implicated in the conspiracy.


== Etymology ==
Fortinbras is the name of a fictional character in William Shakespeare's tragedy Hamlet; Fortinbras is a Norwegian crown prince who, at the end of the play, is to be crowned ruler of Denmark following the death of nearly all the major characters.
