== Biography ==


=== 1995–1996 school year ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Dolores Umbridge inducting her, Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe and several other students into the Inquisitorial Squad 		 	 
She was in her sixth year in the 1995–1996 school year. During that year, she became a member of the short-lived Inquisitorial Squad, an organisation created that year by the newly appointed Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor and High Inquisitor Dolores Umbridge. Her involvement in the discovery of Dumbledore's Army in 1996 is unknown, although along with all the other squad members, she would have used her power abusively to discriminate against other non-Slytherin students.
In June 1996, when Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ginevra Weasley, Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood tried to use the fireplace in Umbridge's office to communicate with Sirius Black via the Floo Network, Umbridge and several squad members, including herself, caught them. She managed to restrain Ginny by grabbing hold of her and holding both her arms in a tight-grip. However, she and the squad failed to keep the Dumbledore's Army members restrained for very long, as once Umbridge had left with Harry and Hermione to the Forbidden Forest, all the present squad members were attacked with various offensive spells by Ginny, Neville and Luna in revenge, such as with Ginny's particularly powerful Bat-Bogey Hex. She was presumably incapacitated during the incident.


=== Post-Inquisitorial Squad ===
The Inquisitorial Squad was disbanded following the suspension and departure of Umbridge from Hogwarts, following the British Ministry of Magic's long awaited (but still reluctant) acceptance that Lord Voldemort had indeed returned. Her activities after the disbandment are unknown.
