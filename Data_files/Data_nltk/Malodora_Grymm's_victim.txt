This girl was said to have been the most beautiful in the kingdom. After the Hag Malodora Grymm, wife of the King, became aware of her beauty through her talking mirror, she used a poisoned apple which she gave to her, which put her into a deep sleep. She appears to have been inserted into the Muggle fairy tale, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
