This rabbit was owned by Billy Stubbs sometime in the 1930s. After Billy got into an argument with Tom Riddle, Riddle used magic of some form to hang the rabbit from the rafters of Wool's Orphanage. Mrs Cole would later recount the story of this happening to Albus Dumbledore when he came to inform Riddle of how he was in fact a wizard and of the existence Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
