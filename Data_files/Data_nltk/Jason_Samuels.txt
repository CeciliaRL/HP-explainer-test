Jason Samuels was a wizard and Ravenclaw student who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was a Beater for the Ravenclaw Quidditch team during the 1993–1994 school year.


== Etymology ==
The name "Jason" comes from the Greek name Ιασων (Iason), which was derived from Greek ιασθαι (iasthai) "to heal". In Greek mythology Jason was the leader of the Argonauts. After his uncle Pelias overthrew his father as king of Iolcos, Jason went in search of the Golden Fleece in order to win back the throne. During his journeys he married the sorceress Medea, who helped him gain the fleece and kill his uncle, but who later turned against him when he fell in love with another woman.
