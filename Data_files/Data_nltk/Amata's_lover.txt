Amata's lover is a character in the story of The Fountain of Fair Fortune by Beedle the Bard.
He was a wizard who had deserted his lover, a witch named Amata, and this caused her to believe that her broken heart would never mend, for she had loved him dearly.
Hence, Amata went on a journey to the Fountain of Fair Fortune to relieve herself of the grief and longing that his desertion had caused her. However, by the time she reached the fountain, she had realised that he had been cruel and faithless, and it was actually a joy to her to be rid of him.
