Blodwyn Bludd (b. 1923), also known as the Vampire from the Valleys, was a vampire singer from the Valleys region of Wales. He was famous for his bass-baritone voice and for singing to his victims before sinking his fangs into their necks.


== Behind the scenes ==
This character's name was clearly constructed primarily as a play on the word "blood," since Blodwyn is actually a girl's name, and means "white flowers" in Welsh. The surname, using correct Welsh pronunciation, would lose its vampiric connotations, as it would be pronounced "Bleeth" (th as in 'the', not as in 'teeth').
