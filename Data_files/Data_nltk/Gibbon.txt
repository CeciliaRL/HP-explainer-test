On 30 June 1997, Gibbon fought in the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, along with fellow Death Eaters Alecto and Amycus Carrow, Corban Yaxley, Thorfinn Rowle, Draco Malfoy, Severus Snape, and Fenrir Greyback. Gibbon was the Death Eater who set the Dark Mark above the Astronomy Tower. It is supposed that he did not like the idea of staying at the tower and waiting for Albus Dumbledore alone, so he ran downstairs. He died shortly afterwards, when a stray Killing Curse cast by Thorfinn Rowle that missed Remus Lupin struck Gibbon instead. It is unknown what happened to his body after the battle.


== Personality and traits ==
Almost nothing is known about Gibbon's exact personality, except the fact that he feared Albus Dumbledore and that he did not want to stay at the Astronomy Tower and wait for him alone.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Dark Arts: Being a Death Eater, Gibbon would have been proficient in dark magic, including the casting of Dark charms and likely the Unforgivable Curses. Gibbon was capable of creating the Dark Mark above Hogwarts, during a battle, something that only a skilled and experienced dark wizard could create, according to Arthur Weasley.
Duelling: As a Death Eater, he was a competent and experienced duellist, as he fought against the Order of the Phoenix and escaping in order to go to the Astronomy Tower, meaning he had some skill in martial magic.


== Etymology ==
A "gibbon" is a type of primate. Gibbon is also a 15th century diminuative form of Gilbert. [1] [2] [3] [4]. See Gilbert Wimple and Eleanor Sarah Gibbs for further details.


== Behind the scenes ==
During the Battle of the Astronomy Tower he was recognised by Remus Lupin, suggesting that the two have encountered each other in the past, or at least that he was a known Death Eater to the Order prior to the battle.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the Battle of the Astronomy Tower did not take place, meaning Gibbon was not killed by a stray Killing Curse.
