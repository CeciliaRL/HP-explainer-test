In the short skit The Queen's Handbag, Brodwin was sent to Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger at Hogwarts when the Queen's Handbag went missing. The owl landed on a chair in the Gryffindor common room with the letter about the disappearance. Ron initially believed the letter came from the Minister for Magic, however Hermione realised it actually came from the Muggle Prime Minister. After watching Harry and Ron attempt to use a Summoning Charm to retrieve the handbag, the owl was given a letter from Hermione granting Buckingham Palace a temporary allowance of magic so they could summon the handbag themselves.
Although this owl looks similar to Harry's owl Hedwig, since Harry did not recognise it, it would seem to be a different owl. In the beginning of the skit, however, the owl is referred to as "Brodwin".
