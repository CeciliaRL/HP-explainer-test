 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Ragnok's office at Gringotts Wizarding Bank 		 	 
Ragnok worked at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in the 1990's , and had an office next to Griphook in the main offices at Diagon Alley. Ragnok was acquainted with Bill Weasley, and seemingly known to Remus Lupin as well.
It seems that Ragnok's leanings were such that Professor Lupin thought he might be amenable to helping the Order of the Phoenix, though when Bill tried to convince him to do so in 1995, Ragnok declined, as he was feeling a lot of hostility toward wizards at the time. Ludo Bagman had recently failed to pay some goblins winnings to which they felt they were entitled, and Ragnok believed that the Ministry of Magic had conspired to hide evidence of this. He expressed his thoughts on the matter very vehemently.
