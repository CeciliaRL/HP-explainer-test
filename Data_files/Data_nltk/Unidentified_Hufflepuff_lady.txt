This Hufflepuff lady had portraits hung at Hogwarts Castle.


== Biography ==


=== 1991–1992 school year ===
In Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she was guarding a secret room in the Castle's Grounds, concealing a Chocolate Frog Card. The password required to gain entrance was "Catweazle".


=== 1992–1993 school year ===
A year later, her portrait had been moved, and now guarded the way to the Hufflepuff Duelling Turrets. Another portrait was also created which guarded a lever room inside a secret area behind a bookcase in the Knights' Room. She was kept with company by the Slytherin knight.


== Behind the scenes ==
This witch may have passed away sometime prior to 1991 as many portraits hung at Hogwarts Castle depict deceased individuals.
Catweazle was a British children's television series in the 1970s that featured an eccentric, time-travelling wizard.
In the Danish version of Philosopher's Stone there is a mistake when Harry uses the password: Fred and George Weasley tell Harry to say "Katvæsel" (Catweasle), but Harry says "Katvæsen" (Catcreature) to the portrait. This appears to be a typo.
