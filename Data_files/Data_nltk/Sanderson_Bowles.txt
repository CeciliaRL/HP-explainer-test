== Biography ==
By at least the 2010s, Bowles became a member of the St. Troglodous Order of Labours. As part of this organisation, he proposed that blended Dragon dung Fertiliser increased the potency of Leaping Toadstools. He shared this advice with a member of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, who brought it back to the rest of the organisation and used it to great effect when using Leaping Toadstools to brew Baruffio's Brain Elixir.
