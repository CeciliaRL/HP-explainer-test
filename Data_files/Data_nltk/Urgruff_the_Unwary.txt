Urgruff the Unwary was a British Goblin, who was deemed to be one of the finest smiths in Goblin history.


== Biography ==
Urgruff boasted that he could make a perfect replica of a Dragon egg in solid gold. True to his word, he was indeed able to accomplish this feat, only for it to be stolen by a mother Dragon that mistook it for one of her own, torched his workshop and retrieved the priced treasure from the ashes of the smithy.
At some point during the 1989â€“1990 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Gringotts Wizarding Bank received intelligence suggesting this dragon had been captured and confined to a famous Dragon Sanctuary in Romania, and tasked one of their Curse-Breakers, Bill Weasley, with retrieving it, having even obtained a portkey to send him on his way.
