Melody Fawley was the daughter of Grim Fawley and Penelope Fawley, who were Aurors. She had a brother, Addison Fawley.
In 2015, her mother Penelope went missing and a subsequent investigation overseen by the council of which Gareth Greengrass was a member, was called off. Her father began searching for her, leading Constance Pickering to suspect he had unleashed the Calamity through the use of the Foundables Spell.
Melody was said to have inherited her mother Penelope's nose.
