Caractacus Phelps (b. 1937) was a wizard from Staines, Surrey. On 1 April, 1979, he (a forty-two year-old, at the time) exploded no less than eight-hundred Stink Pellets, by dropping them en-masse from the roof of the Daily Prophet building in Diagon Alley. The resultant gas cloud caused untold discomfort throughout London, and approximately five-hundred cases of Stinkitus were reported. The Muggle authorities explained the stinking cloud away as an unpleasant emission from a nearby factory.


== Etymology ==
Caractacus comes from Gaelic origin, the name for a British hero who fought the Roman invaders. Caer means "a castle or city"; eacht "an exploit"; and cios, "a tribute". Phelps is related to "Philip", meaning "lover of horses" in Greek.


== Behind the scenes ==
This wizard is only mentioned in the GameCube - Game Boy Advance Link of the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Harry reads about him on a Hint Book, at Gringotts.
He shares the same surname as James and Oliver Phelps, the actors who play Fred and George Weasley in the films. Note that his incident with the stink pellets took place during the Weasley twins' first birthday.
