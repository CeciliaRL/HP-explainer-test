== Etymology ==
The name "Ralph" is contracted form of the Old Norse name Rádúlfr (or its Norman form Radulf). It was introduced into England by Scandinavian settlers before the Norman conquest, though afterward it was bolstered by Norman influence. In the Middle Ages it was usually spelled Ralf, but by the 17th century it was most commonly Rafe, reflecting the normal pronunciation. The Ralph spelling appeared in the 18th century. A famous bearer of the name was Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-1882), an American poet and author who wrote on transcendentalism.
See Radulf, its Latin form Radolphus [1][2]) and its Spanish form Raul Almeida.
