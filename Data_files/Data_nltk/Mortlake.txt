Mortlake (fl. 1992) was a British wizard who kept ferrets.


== Biography ==
In 1992, a Ministry of Magic raid on his home confiscated his ferrets, because they appeared to have experimental charms placed on them. The case was referred to the Committee on Experimental Charms.


== Etymology ==
Anglo-Saxon origin, habitational name for residents of Mortlake in Surrey. “Mort” in Anglo-Saxon means “young salmon”, not to be confused with other historical and current translations of “Mort”. “Lake” may have been derived from “lacu” which translates to “stream”; hence “stream frequented by young salmon”.
Mortlake was home to John Dee, a mathematician, astronomer, astrologer, alchemist and adviser to Queen Elizabeth I. Dee is frequently portrayed as a magician in modern works of fiction.
