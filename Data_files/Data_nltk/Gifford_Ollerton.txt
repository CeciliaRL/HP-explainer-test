In the fifteenth century, giant numbers were relatively big in the British Isles, when compared to today. Wizards became professional giant-slayers in order to restrict these numbers and to protect wizarding communities.
The giant Hengist of Upper Barnton terrorised the small town of Upper Barnton, in England, at somepoint during the fifteenth century. Gifford Ollerton, at the time a fully-fledged wizard rushed to the village's aid, and famously defeated and killed the giant, becoming celebrated as that town's local hero.
Gifford Ollerton died in 1441, at the age of fifty-one.
By the 1990s, Ollerton's effigy was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card that celebrated his achievement.
