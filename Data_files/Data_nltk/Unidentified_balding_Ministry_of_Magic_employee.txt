This individual was a wizard and a Ministry of Magic worker in the late-1990s.


== Biography ==
On the morning of 2 September, 1997, this wizard ran into "Albert Runcorn" (actually Harry Potter in disguise) while entering the Ministry headquarters through the fireplaces in the Atrium. At first he seemed annoyed, but he excused himself and hurried away nervously when he noticed who he had bumped into.
Later, when there were intruders detected in the Ministry, this wizard was sent to the Atrium in order to seal all exits and stop everyone from leaving. When "Albert Runcorn" (actually Harry Potter), "Mafalda Hopkirk" (Hermione Granger) and "Reginald Cattermole" (Ronald Weasley) were leading Muggle-borns in for questioning out to freedom, the wizard seemed aprehensive as to let them pass, but was intimidated by "Runcorn"'s threats and let them pass as Yaxley emerged from one of the lifts. Harry, impersonating Runcorn, then told Yaxley that the balding wizard was trying to get the Muggle-borns out of the Ministry and punched him sending him flying through the air just before he jumped into one of the fireplaces and left the Ministry.
