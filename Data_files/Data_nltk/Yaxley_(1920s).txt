Yaxley was a British wizard born into the prominent Yaxley family, and a proponent of pure-blood values. 


== Biography ==

 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Yaxley with Shafiq, his wife, and Theseus 		 	 
In 1927, Yaxley attended a wizarding ball and was busy socialising with Shafiq when the pair was greeted by Theseus Scamander. Scamander embraced Shafiq and then shook hands with Yaxley as he introduced him to his wife. Scamander's fianc√©e Leta Lestrange kept her distance from Yaxley as she disliked his behaviour of bee-lining towards her due to her blood status as a pure-blood. A short while later, as Leta was wandering the party alone, Yaxley came up to her and quoted from The Predictions of Tycho Dodonus, expressing his belief that her brother had indeed survived the sinking of the ship.
Around a decade later, he and his kinsmen became proud members of the Sacred Twenty-Eight in the Pure-Blood Directory.

Yaxley is played by Adam Ewan in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald. By an apparent transcription mistake, some sources, including Ewan's IMDb profile, list the character's name as "Yarwood".
