Lady Wimborne (fl. 1899) was a witch who was president of the Witches' League.


== Behind the scenes ==
This character is mentioned only on an award certificate seen in the "Lockhart's Office" feature on Disc 2 of the Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets DVD. The prop award certificate appears to be partially constructed from a membership certificate for a real historical organisation called the Ladies' League for the Defence of the Reformed Faith of the Church of England. This group was founded in 1899 by a Lady Wimborne and advocated against ritualism in the Anglican Church.
