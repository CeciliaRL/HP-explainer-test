The 2-Headed Baby was a name given to a set of ischiopagous conjoined twins. They were part of the Circus Arcanus, a travelling wizards' freak show, and visited the United States with it for the first in November-December 1926.


== Behind the scenes ==
Their performance in a wizarding circus may suggest that 2-headed wizards had special magical abilities that one-headed wizards did not have, or their inclusion may be based on just their unusual physique.
The 2 headed Baby is an example of conjoined twins.
