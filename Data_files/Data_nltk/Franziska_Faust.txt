Franziska Faust was a German witch and the manager of the German National Quidditch team in 2014.


== Biography ==
On 22 May, 2014, during the final match of the first round of the 427th Quidditch World Cup between Wales and Germany, German Seeker Thorsten Pfeffer nearly died after failing an attempt at the life-threatening Wronski Feint. Pfeffer collided with the ground at what onlookers estimated to be sixty miles per hour, and his death was only averted by the quick action of the Healers present. Neither players nor crowd were in a celebratory mood, even as Wales won, and only once manager Franziska Faust revealed that Pfeffer would be likely to recover did Welsh manager Gwenog Jones tell the press she was "bloody delighted".
