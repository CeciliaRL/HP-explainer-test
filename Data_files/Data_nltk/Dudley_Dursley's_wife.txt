Mrs Dursley was the wife of Dudley Dursley: the couple had two children. When her husband's cousin Harry Potter visited them with his family, their children would play while Dudley and Harry sat together quietly.
She is related to the Dursley family, and the Evans family, who are the maternal family of her mother-in-law, Petunia. She is related to the Potter family, due to her marriage to Dudley Dursley, whose cousin is Harry Potter, and is related to her own maternal and paternal family.
It is unknown as to whether she knows about her husband's cousin being part of the wizarding world.
