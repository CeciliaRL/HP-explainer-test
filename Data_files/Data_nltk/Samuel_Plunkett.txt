Samuel Plunkett was a wizard who was famously persecuted by a Muggle village at some point in history. To avoid persecution he poured Shrinking Solution into the village well and spent his entire birthday chasing the shrunken villagers around in hobnail boots. Author Zygmunt Budge wrote about this incident in his Book of Potions.
