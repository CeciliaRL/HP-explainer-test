 	 	 	 		 		 		 			The Daily Prophet reports the disappearance of Riya Patel, among others 		 	 
They were one of the Aurors who mysteriously vanished during the London Five sometime during the mid-to-late 2010s. Their disappearance occurred within a few hours of the other four Aurors. It was the first instance of people having gone mysteriously missing since the Second Wizarding War, and hence came as a great shock to the wizarding community of Great Britain at large. An investigation was launched by the British Ministry of Magic to try and locate Patel and their fellow victims. As time passed, however, the Ministry met a dead end when the trail went cold, and it was generally felt by many that the chance of finding Patel grew increasingly smaller, causing the despair of their family to increase and turn into outrage when the case was closed. As Gareth Greengrass indeed speculated, it is very likely that Patel was deceased, as of 2018, though there was a small chance they were still alive.
