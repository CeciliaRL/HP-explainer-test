These Mooncalves lived in the Forest Grove at least in the 1980s.


== History ==
During the 1980s, these Mooncalves witnessed a dance of the Mooncalf from the Magical Creatures Reserve and Jacob's sibling, after which they welcomed the Mooncalf into the herd.


== Behind the scenes ==
In a trailer for Hogwarts Legacy, set in the late 19th century, a student was shown feeding a group of Mooncalves in a forest. If the forest was the Forbidden Forest, this may have been the same herd.
