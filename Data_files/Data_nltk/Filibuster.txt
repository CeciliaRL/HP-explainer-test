Dr Filibuster was a wizard or witch that created the Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, which the Weasley twins were known to use, or at least purchase, from time-to-time. Harry Potter once predicted that the Weasley twins' line of fireworks would put Filibuster out of business, though whether this actually happened or not is unknown.
