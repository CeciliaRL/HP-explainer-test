This ghost attended Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday party on 31 October, 1992. He was described as portly. He floated through spoiled food and claimed that he could almost taste it.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is unknown if this ghost resided at Hogwarts Castle or if he only came there to celebrate Sir Nicholas's Deathday.
If the knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead is Harold II and the ragged man wearing chains is Jacob Marley and connects to the fact that Sir Nicholas served the royal family in his lifetime it could mean that Nick only invited important people, which again could mean this is Daniel Lambert; a portly man, known for his unusually large size, and who had become a popular character after his death.
