A book about Elfric the Eager 		 	 

Elfric the Eager was an individual responsible for a revolt. His actions were taught in History of Magic, a course at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


== Behind the scenes ==
Elfric the Eager's species is not established, but since he was responsible for a revolt, and is covered in a History of Magic class, it is likely he was a goblin. The icon of the History of Magic class about Elfric the Eager in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery also supports this speculation. However, this has not yet been confirmed.
