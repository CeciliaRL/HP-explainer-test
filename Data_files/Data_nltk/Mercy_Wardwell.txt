Mercy Wardwell was an American witch who played as the Chaser for the American National Quidditch team, and competed in the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.


== Biography ==
During the America-Brazil semi-finals taking place on 4 July and 5 July, the nerves got to Wardwell and after her fifth fumble with the Quaffle, she began to repeatedly hit her head against her broom handle before being stopped by fellow teammate and Seeker, Darius Smackhammer.
During the play-offs for third place against Japan on 9 July, she and her fellow American Chasers, Arsenia Gonzales and Quentin Kowalski, scored twelve goals. The Japanese Seeker, Noriko Sato, went into a spectatular dive and grabbed the Snitch from under Wardwell's heel, allowing Japan to win with a score of 330-120.
