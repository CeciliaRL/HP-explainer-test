Lars Lundekvam was Norwegian wizard who played as a Chaser for the 2014 Norwegian National Quidditch team.


== Biography ==
During the first match of the 2014 Quidditch World Cup against the Ivory Coast, Lundekvam twice suffered jinxes cast at him from members of the crowd, leading the match to be halted while security wizards located the culprits. These unprovoked attacks were presumably due to the crowd's distaste at the Norwegian team, as their mascot, a Selma, had instigated a fight against the Fijian Dukuwaqa that escalated into a chaotic riot amongst the mascots that left three hundred wizards injured.
