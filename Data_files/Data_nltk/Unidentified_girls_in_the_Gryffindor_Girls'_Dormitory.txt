These two girls were witches and students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They were both members of Gryffindor house.


== Biography ==


=== Early lives ===
These two girls started their first year of magical education at Hogwarts in 1991, and were both Sorted into Gryffindor house. They shared a dormitory with Hermione Granger, Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown, who were also Gryffindor girls in their year.


=== Third year ===

Throughout the 1993â€“1994 school year at Hogwarts, their third year, these two girls often hung around in the Gryffindor Girls' Dormitory in Gryffindor Tower, and talked amongst each other.

This year at Hogwarts, the time Dementors were standing guard at every entrance. Neither one of these girls liked the Dementors. After the brown haired-girl heard that she was doing the same subjects as Draco Malfoy, she was highly displeased, and wished she did not have any classes with him. Her friend felt the same about having Care of Magical Creatures with Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabbe.

The brown-haired planned on trying out for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. As she had a Beater's bat by her bed, she presumably liked playing Beater, but the team already had two; Fred and George Weasley. However, it is possible that she hoped she could replace one of them, or was simply confused.
The two girls, as well as Parvati and Lavender, were up and ready for their first day before Hermione was, though Parvati and Lavender had already left. While Hermione rushed to her class, the two friends remained in the dormitory, talking for a while. In the lesson, they were taught about Boggarts by Remus Lupin, the new teacher as of Professor Lockhart's departure, and had a practical lesson on how to banish them. The girls faced the Boggart, and it turned into either a rat, rattlesnake or bloody eyeball for them.
After Sirius Black broke onto Gryffindor Tower, the girls slept with the rest of the school in the Great Hall in squashy purple sleeping bags that Professor Dumbledore conjured. However, she returned to her normal bed the day after, and spent most of her time talking with her friend in their dormitory.


== Personality and traits ==

The brown-haired girl was more outgoing than her blonde-haired friend, openly shouting "go away!" one morning when Hermione rushed passed her, while her friend just exclaimed "hey!". She was the only girl in her dormitory who liked Quidditch, and was unashamed at saying that Cedric Diggory was the most handsome boy in the school. She was also rather lazy at times, staying in the dormitory while everyone else ran off for Defence Against the Dark Arts.


== Behind the scenes ==
The identities of these girls are unspecified in the third video game. It is also possible that they are the two unidentified Gryffindor girls who appear in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
