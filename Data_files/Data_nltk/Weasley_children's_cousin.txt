This individual was the son of an uncle of the Weasley children. His father got drunk and mistook Harry Potter (who was disguised as a redheaded Muggle boy from Ottery St Catchpole) for him at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour.


== Behind the scenes ==
As it is known that Arthur Weasley had two brothers and no sisters, it is widely assumed that the unnamed "uncle of Ron's" mentioned in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is one of Arthur's brothers, and thus a Weasley. However, since it is unknown whether Gideon and Fabian Prewett were Molly Weasley's only siblings, it is possible the unnamed uncle was another brother of Molly or the husband of an hypothetical sister of Molly's. This means that the unnamed uncle's son could be a Weasley, a Prewett (if the son of Molly's brother), or a member of another family (if the son of Molly's sister).
