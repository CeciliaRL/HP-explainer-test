These colleagues of Charlie Weasley were Dragonologists that worked with Charlie.


== Biography ==
A rather cheery lot, in 1992, four of them helped to fly the Norwegian Ridgeback Norbert to their Romanian Dragon Sanctuary. In 1994, about twenty or thirty of them helped bring the dragons for the 1994 Triwizard Tournament.


== Behind the scenes ==
The narrator's dialogue on the PC version of the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone implies that Charlie himself came to Hogwarts to collect Norbert rather than sending his associates. Despite this, at least two figures on broomsticks are seen flying around the Astronomy Tower, and the scene is too shadowy to distinguish any features of the people in question.
