William Topaz McGonagall (c. 1825â€”29 September, 1902) was a Scottish Muggle celebrated as the worst poet in British history. A buffoonish man, McGonagall may be distantly related to Minerva McGonagall, through her Muggle father, Robert McGonagall.

William McGonagall was a real British poet, who lived in the nineteenth century. He is widely acclaimed as the worst poet in British history, based on his spontaneously amusing and inappropriate rhythms, weak vocabulary, poor scansions, and ill-advised imagery.
