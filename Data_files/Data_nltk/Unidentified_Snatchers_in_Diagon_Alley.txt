This gang of Snatchers could be found patrolling the streets of Diagon Alley in 1997-1998.


== History ==
During the time in which Death Eaters controlled the British Ministry of Magic in the late 1990s, these Snatchers patrolled the dark and derelict streets of Diagon Alley, intimidating other wizards with their threatening presence. In 1997, Mundungus Fletcher saw them, and hid in an alleyway to avoid them spotting him. 
In 1998, the trio and Griphook saw these Snatchers patrolling the streets of Diagon Alley as they were entering Gringotts Wizarding Bank. It is likely, although unproven that these Snatchers participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, on 2 May 1998, and were killed by Neville Longbottom when he blew up the Wooden Bridge which the Snatchers tried to cross.
