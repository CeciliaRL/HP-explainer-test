This Dark Wizard was a Death Eater and a servant of Lord Voldemort during the Second Wizarding War.


== Biography ==
He was one of the many Death Eaters who were present at the meeting in Malfoy Manor. He was sitting next to Corban Yaxley and appeared to be the youngest of the Death Eaters present with the exception of Draco Malfoy. When Lord Voldemort asked one of his followers to hand over their wand, he remained silent with his head down, in fear of his master's deeply malign and terrifying presence.
He later fought during the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May, 1998. He survived the first round, and after Harry Potter sacrificed himself to Lord Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, he guarded the captured Rubeus Hagrid back to the castle along with other Death Eaters, while Hagrid carried Harry's believed dead body.
After Harry revealed that he was actually alive, is possible that he fled the battle, along with other Death Eaters. It is also highly possible that he was killed during the final stages of the battle, or arrested and sent to Azkaban for his crimes as a Death Eater.


== Behind the scenes ==
