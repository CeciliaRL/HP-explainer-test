Inigo Fuente Marrero was a Spanish wizard who played as Seeker on the Spanish National Quidditch team in 1994.
In the 1996–1997 school year, Marrero's Chocolate Frog Card could be won by beating Fay Dunbar in a Gobstones challenge.


== Etymology ==
The name "Íñigo" is a Medieval Spanish form of Eneko, which means "ardent" or "fiery". Together with teammate Tiago Montoya, the name may be a reference to Íñigo Montoya from the romantic comedy fantasy novel (and the film adaptation) The Princess Bride. It was also the birth name of Saint Ignatius of Loyola, who changed it in honour of Saint Ignatius of Antioch. As such, this name is sometimes regarded as a form of Ignatius.
"Fuente" means "Fountain" in Spanish, and "Marrero" is an occupational name for a stone breaker ("marrero"), a derivative of "marra", which means "hammer".
