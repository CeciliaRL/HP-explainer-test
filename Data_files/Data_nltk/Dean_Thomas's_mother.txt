Mrs Thomas was the mother of Dean Thomas. Though she was a Muggle, her first husband was a wizard, but he never told her so, believing that not knowing the truth would keep her safe. He deserted Mrs Thomas when their son was still a small boy and was eventually murdered by Death Eaters.
Mrs Thomas remarried a Muggle man and had several children with him. The family lived in London and were described as having "a very happy home life".
When a letter arrived for Dean from Hogwarts in 1991, Mrs Thomas considered the possibility that her first husband might have been a wizard, but, like her son, was never able to confirm this suspicion.
In 1995, Dean opted not to let his parents know about the murder of Cedric Diggory, presumably because he worried they would withdraw him from Hogwarts.
Dean had to go into hiding in 1997 because he was unable to prove he was a half-blood to the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. Mrs Thomas and her second husband were not sure where their son had gone, and were deeply concerned, so the radio programme Potterwatch asked its listeners to contact the Thomases if they knew anything about Dean.
