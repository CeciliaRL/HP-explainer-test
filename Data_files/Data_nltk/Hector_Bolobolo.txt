Hector Bolobolo was a Fijian wizard and the manager and trainer of the Fijian National Quidditch team in 2014.


== Biography ==
On the second match of the 427th Quidditch World Cup, Fiji against Nigeria, his team suffered a blistering defeat due to Seeker Joseph Snuka's choice to catch the Snitch when his team was losing 400 to 10. Amid the bewilderment of the commentators, the fury of the Fijian supporters and the jeers of the Nigerians, Bolobolo's only comment was "I am going to kill him".
