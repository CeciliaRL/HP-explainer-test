 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Liz Tuttle meeting this Augurey in the Magical Creatures Reserve 		 	 
During the 1988â€“1989 school year, Albus Dumbledore asked Rubeus Hagrid to procure a feather of an Augurey to make a special quill for a special book. Jacob's sibling wanted to help him with the feather, so they started to bond with this Augurey, taking it hunting for a meal in Hagrid's garden, but the Augurey turned to be incapable of catching insects and fairies due to its inability to fly.
Professor Kettleburn gave it an examination and reached the conclusion that there was nothing wrong with it. He explained that there was an evolutionary purpose behind Augureys' cries, which, contrary to common misbelief, could predict rain, and they could only fly when it was raining.

Jacob's sibling and Liz Tuttle brought the Augurey to the Herbology Classroom and asked Professor Sprout to create a local rainstorm so it could fly. After having received some help spraying Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent on Mandrakes, Sprout created the rainstorm and the Augurey took off, leaving one of its feathers to the students.

They presented the feather to Dumbledore, who believed Hagrid had misunderstood him and thought the feather was for the Quill of Acceptance, while in fact it was only for a quill to write his diary.
