The grandmother of Barnaby Lee (whom he called his "grandmum") was a witch who owned a collection of Dark Artefacts. Since she never bought him toys as a child, Barnaby used to play with her artefacts instead. She also owned a crup, although her grandson suspected she only did to scare Muggles.


== Physical description ==

Barnaby's grandmother was described by him as looking a bit like a Dementor; therefore her appearance can be assumed to be somewhat frail, with a skeletal appearance.
