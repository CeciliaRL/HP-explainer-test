This Muggle woman was on the Millennium Bridge when it was destroyed by Death Eaters in 1996. As the bridge collapsed, the woman ran for her life. It is unknown what happened to her afterwards.


== Behind the scenes ==
She was portrayed by Ninette Finch in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, there were no Muggles on the Millennium Bridge during its destruction, so the woman was omitted from the game.
