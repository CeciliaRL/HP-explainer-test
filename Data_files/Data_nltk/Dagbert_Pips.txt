Dagbert Pips was a British wizard, who was the owner of Pumpkins R Us. He stated to a Daily Prophet reporter that the latest Ministry-imposed restrictions on Hallowe'en celebrations would affect pumpkin-growers  like himself extremely harshly.
Magical pumpkins cultivated by Pips included luminous pumpkins, flying pumpkins, singing pumpkins and exploding pumpkins.
