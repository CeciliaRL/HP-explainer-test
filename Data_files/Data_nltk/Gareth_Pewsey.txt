Gareth Pewsey was a Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. He competed in the school Gobstones tournament during the 1996–1997 school year.


== Etymology ==
The meaning of the name "Gareth" is unknown. It first appears in this form in Thomas Malory's 15th-century compilation of Arthurian legends Le Morte d'Arthur, in which Gareth was a knight of the Round Table, the brother of Sir Gawain. Malory based the name on Gahariet, which was the name of a similar Arthurian character in French sources. It may ultimately have a Welsh origin, possibly related to gwaredd meaning "gentleness".
