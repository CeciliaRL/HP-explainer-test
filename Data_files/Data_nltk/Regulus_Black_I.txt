Regulus Black (1906 â€“ 1959) was a pure-blood wizard, the youngest child of Sirius Black II and Hesper Gamp and brother of Arcturus Black III and Lycoris. Regulus never married and never had children.


== Etymology ==
Members of the House of Black and their history seem to have made a tradition of naming their children after stars and constellations. In Latin, regulus means "little king" and was one term for a basilisk. As a name, it has also been applied to the star Alpha Leonis, which is situated at the heart of the lion in the constellation Leo. Regulus was also the family name of a Roman general, Marcus Atilius Regulus, who was known for his honour and self-sacrifice.


== Behind the scenes ==
Based on a statement by Horace Slughorn, Regulus may have been a member of the Slytherin House. However, he attended Hogwarts c. 1917 - 1924, when Slughorn may not have been Potions master.
Regulus was the granduncle of another Black called Regulus.
