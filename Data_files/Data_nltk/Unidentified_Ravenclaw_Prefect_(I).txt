This unidentified Ravenclaw student began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the late 1980s and eventually became a Prefect in the 1990s. He led the first-year students to their common room in 1991.


== Behind the scenes ==
He goes down towards the Dungeons, despite the Ravenclaw common room being in a tower. However, the complex layout of the Grand Staircase is revealed with detail on the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and it could be possible for them to get down one floor to get to a stairway closer to the Ravenclaw common room and climb the stairs once more. Alternatively, it is possible for them to have gone through a shortcut in the Dungeons, or to use one of the secret passages guarded by portraits. This is explained shortly after as they are seen going upstairs when Percy Weasley said to keep an eye on the staircases, and the screen moves upwards.
The prefect is portrayed by Richard Reid in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
It is possible that this individual is Robert Hilliard as this boy looked very much like a fifth-year and they were both Ravenclaw Prefects, and it was known that Hilliard welcomed the Ravenclaw first-years in Harry's year.
