Gilbert P. Bingley was an American No-Maj man who worked as a loan officer at the Steen National Bank branch in New York in the 1920s. He was described as "imposing" and "impeccably suited."


== Biography ==

On 6 December 1926, Bingley conducted an in-person review of Jacob Kowalski's application for a loan to open a bakery. He summarily rejected the application when it became clear that Kowalski had insufficient income or assets to offer collateral.
Shortly thereafter, Bingley wandered down to the basement of the bank and found Jacob standing in front of an opened vault, in which Newt Scamander was trying to recapture his escaped Niffler. Thinking that Jacob was trying to steal the money he needed, Bingley activated the alarm, but was swiftly paralysed with the Full Body-Bind Curse by Newt, allowing the wizard and his unlikely No-Maj companion to escape.
Two days later, Newt Scamander had Frank the Thunderbird disperse swooping evil venom over New York by creating a rainstorm, in order to erase the memories of a recent magical catastrophe from the minds of the city's No-Maj population. At the time, Bingley was taking a shower in the bathroom while his wife brushed her teeth at the sink, the water erasing his memories as it washed over him.
He likely took a sudden retirement due to the strange activities he experienced at his bank.
