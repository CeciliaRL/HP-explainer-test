This witch was born sometime before 1927 into a wizarding family. In early September of 1927, she witnessed Grindelwald calling upon his followers in Paris, and was receptive to his call. That same day, she attended Grindelwald's rally in the Lestrange Mausoleum on the PÃ¨re-Lachaise Cemetery.
When Aurors infiltrated the rally, she turned to attack an Auror that stood behind her after becoming enraged at the Aurors' presence. This outburst of anger resulted in not only the Auror in question raising his wand to defend himself, but also her own demise with the Killing Curse which the same Auror cast; which in turn caused Grindelwald to shout out in fury of her slaying.
