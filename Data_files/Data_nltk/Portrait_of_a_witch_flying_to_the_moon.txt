This individual was a witch whose portrait hung at Hogwarts Castle in the 1990s, on the seventh-floor level of the Grand Staircase, next to a portrait of wailing Egyptians and the Staring Portrait. She was depicted in black robes, and seemed to have befriended a portrait of a man on a flying carpet.
