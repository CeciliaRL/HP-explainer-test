Astor Bellchant was a British wizard and member of the Bellchants, a prominent wizarding family.


== Biography ==
Astor was born at some point into the respectable wizarding Bellchant family. In his adult life, he had at least one son, Albert, who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
In an investigation concerning the disappearance of a wizard named Bilius Finbok, Astor Bellchant was suspected to have blackmailed Finbok into brewing an illegal potion.


== Possessions ==
Owl: Astor owned an owl to deliver his mail. Astor Bellchant used this owl to send a blackmail note to Bilius Finbok, who was hospitalised at the Muggle St David's Hospital. Michael Babatola, who was a nurse there, noted that Finbok had run away from the hospital shortly after an owl landed on his window in the middle of the day.


== Etymology ==
Astor, rarely used as a given name, derives from a surname derived from Occitan astur, meaning "hawk". The Astor family was a very prominent family in business and politics in the United States and the United Kingdom during the 19th and 20th centuries; famous members include John Jacob Astor I, the first multi-millionaire in the United States; William Waldorf Astor, the first Viscount Astor; and John Jacob Astor IV, the richest passenger aboard the RMS Titanic.
