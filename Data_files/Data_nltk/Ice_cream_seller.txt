There was an ice cream salesclerk at the zoo entrance, selling ice creams in her van.
On 23 June, 1991, she sold two chocolate ice creams to Dudley Dursley and Piers Polkiss and a cheap lemon ice lolly to Harry Potter, only because she asked him what he wanted before Vernon Dursley could hurry him away.
