The Goshawk sisters were the nine sisters of the Goshawk family. They included the renowned author Miranda Goshawk as well as Diadema Goshawk, Romilda Goshawk, Tangwystl Goshawk and five other sisters of unknown name.
Miranda was the youngest of the nine and in their youth, the sisters would often play pranks on Miranda by giving her incorrect incantations for spells. Miranda, as the youngest, also often ended up wearing her sisters' hand-me-down robes.
Miranda was eventually able to turn the tables on her sisters when she wrote Book of Spells and her sisters "somehow" ended up with copies featuring misprints.
