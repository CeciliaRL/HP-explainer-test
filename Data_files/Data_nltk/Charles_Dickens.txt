Charles Dickens was an English author who wrote David Copperfield.


== Etymology ==
The name "Charles" comes from the Germanic name Karl, which was derived from a Germanic word which meant "man". However, an alternative theory states that it is derived from the common Germanic element hari meaning "army, warrior".


== Behind the scenes ==
Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort) portrays Dickens in the 2013 film The Invisible Woman, which he also directs. Michelle Fairley (Mrs Granger) also appears as Caroline Graves. 
An 1839 portrait of Charles Dickens by Daniel Maclise appears to be the basis of a portrait of Podric Batworthy used in the Harry Potter films.
