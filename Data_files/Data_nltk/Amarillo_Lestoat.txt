Amarillo Lestoat (1776â€”1977) was a flamboyant American vampire. He wrote a book, A Vampire's Monologue, which was intended to bore readers out of their minds and render them easier to bite. For his infamy, he was immortalised onto a Chocolate Frog Card.


== Etymology ==
"Amarillo" is Spanish for "yellow", "le" is French for "the" and a stoat is an animal related to the weasel. Consequently, his name appears to translate to "the yellow stoat".


== Behind the scenes ==
His surname and overall character might be based on the character Lestat de Lioncourt, a vampire in Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles, who has a similar appearance and lived within the same time frame.


== Appearances ==
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (video game) (Appears on a Famous Wizard Card)
