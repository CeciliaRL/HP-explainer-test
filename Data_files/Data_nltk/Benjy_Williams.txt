Benjy Wiliams was an English wizard who played as the Seeker for Puddlemere United. His catch of the Snitch, amidst the chaos of the riot during a 1999 match against the Holyhead Harpies, won the game and brought it to a close. He and other team members had to be escorted to safety by Hit-Wizards from the Magical Law Enforcement Squad.
