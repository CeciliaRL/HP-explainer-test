An unidentified individual was the uncle of a wizard, Eustace Fawley. Eustace spoke fondly of him, and how he lived in Fiji.


== Behind the scenes ==
It's unknown what side of Eustace's family he belonged to. Since the Fawley family was included in the Pure-Blood Directory in the 1930s, it's unlikely (but not impossible) that they would marry into a Muggle family. He was likely a wizard.
If he was a Fawley, he would have been part of a well-known wizarding family.
