Mr Trelawney was a wizard. He was the great-grandson of the famous Seer Cassandra Trelawney. However, along with the two generations of Trelawneys preceding him, he did not possess the gift of Second Sight. He married a Muggle woman, and together they had a daughter, Sybill, who turned out to have limited Sight.
