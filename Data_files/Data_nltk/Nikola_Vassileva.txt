Nikola Vassileva was a Bulgarian witch and a Chaser for the 2014 Bulgarian National Quidditch team. During the second quarter-final match of the 427th Quidditch World Cup, against Norway, Nikola Vassileva scored both of Bulgaria's goals, which Norwegian Chaser Lars Lundekvam soon equalised. Seeker Viktor Krum, soon after, caught the Snitch, making Bulgaria the victor.
