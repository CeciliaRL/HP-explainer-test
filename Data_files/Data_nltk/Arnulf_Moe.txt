Arnulf Moe was a Norwegian wizard and the manager of the Norwegian National Quidditch team in 2014. It was his decision to change the team mascot from performing trolls to the Selma. When questioned about the change after conflict the Selma had with the Fijian Dukuwaqa, Moe defended his choice, claiming that the Selma represented the "steely determination and ferocity of the Norwegian players".
