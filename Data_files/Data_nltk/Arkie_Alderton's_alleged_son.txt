Alderton was a Muggle-born or half-blood wizard who was sent to Azkaban for "stealing magic" by the Muggle-Born Registration Commission in 1997, while Lord Voldemort was in control of the Ministry of Magic during the height of the Second Wizarding War. He told Dolores Umbridge and Yaxley that he was the son of Arkie Alderton, who was a wizard known for designing broomsticks, but he was not believed. Alderton only stopped screaming desperately when he was threatened with the Dementor's Kiss, but his "dry sobs echoed through the corridor" as he was dragged away to prison. He was likely released after Lord Voldemort's final defeat.
