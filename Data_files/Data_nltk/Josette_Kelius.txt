Josette Kelius was an American wizarding criminal who operated in the 1920s.
In 1926, the Magical Congress of the United States of America issued a wanted poster for Josette Kelius, stating that she was wanted for "atrocities against the wizarding community," and describing her as a "vicious wizard" and a "malicious killer." A reward of 4500 Dragots was offered for information leading to her capture.
