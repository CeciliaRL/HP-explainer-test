Mr McLaggen was the father of Cormac McLaggen. On 1 September, 1997, when Death Eaters stopped the Hogwarts Express en route to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and boarded it to search for Harry Potter, Cormac threatened them that his father would hear about their actions. Death Eaters, however, completely ignored Cormac and continued their search.
