Harvey Ridgebit (1881 â€“ 1973) was a wizard and the first dragonologist to catch a Peruvian Vipertooth. He also established the world's largest dragon sanctuary in Romania, where Charlie Weasley worked and where Rubeus Hagrid's dragon, Norberta (a.k.a. Norbert) was eventually sent to live.


== Etymology ==
The name "Harvey" comes from the Breton given name Haerviu, which meant "battle worthy", from haer, "battle" and viu, "worthy". This was the name of a 6th-century Breton hermit, who is the patron saint of the blind. It was introduced to England by settlers from Brittany after the Norman conquest. During the later Middle Ages it became rare, but it was revived in the 19th century.
