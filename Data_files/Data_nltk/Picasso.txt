Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Clito Ruiz y Picasso was a Muggle artist. His works are known in both the Muggle and the Wizarding world. However, it is also possible that Severus Snape only knew about him because he was a half-blood, and therefore had more knowledge of the Muggle world than the average wizard.
