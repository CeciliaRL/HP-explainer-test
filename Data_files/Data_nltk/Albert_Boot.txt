Minister Albert Boot was Minister for Magic from 1747 to 1752. He was considered a likeable Minister, but also an inept one. After mismanaging a goblin rebellion, he resigned from the post.  He was first elected Minister by the Wizarding population of Great Britain and Ireland after the death of Eldritch Diggory.
