Ogg was the gamekeeper at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during Arthur Weasley and Molly Prewett's time at the school.


== History ==
After Rubeus Hagrid was expelled in 1943, Albus Dumbledore convinced Armando Dippet to keep Hagrid and train him as gamekeeper. Hagrid presumably served as Ogg's assistant before Ogg left the position and Hagrid was promoted.
In 1995, Molly became intrigued by the Whomping Willow when she visited Harry Potter during the third task, and she reminisced at length about Ogg.
