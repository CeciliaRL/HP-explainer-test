Humphrey Balsamo was a British wizard and shop assistant working at Slug & Jiggers, a shop specialising in potions and their ingredients in Diagon Alley.


== Biography ==
At the time of Balsamo's employment at Slug & Jiggers, the apothecary was broken into and wrecked by what seemed to be a magical beast, thus prompting investigation by Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner from the Ministry of Magic's Beast Division.


== Etymology ==
In Latin, "balsamo" is a declension of the noun "balsamum", meaning balsam or balm, a sweet-smelling oil or soothing ointment derived from plants; it's a rather fitting surname for someone who works in an apothecary.
Giuseppe Balsamo (1743â€“1795), who is more commonly known by the assumed pseudonym and self-conferred title of "Count Alessandro di Cagliostro", was a noted charlatan and impostor who infiltrated several royal courts of Europe as a quack and self-styled magician.
