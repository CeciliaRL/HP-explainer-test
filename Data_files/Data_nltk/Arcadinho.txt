Arcadinho was a local wizard guide to Brazilian jungles.


== History ==
At some point during the Calamity, a Calamity Investigator serving as part of the Ministry of Magic's Statute of Secrecy Task Force travelled to the jungles of Brazil in search of pure Angel's Trumpet with which they could brew Tonic for Trace Detection. After discovering a massive supply, they coordinated an export strategy with Arcadinho.


== Behind the scenes ==
The Portuguese word "arcadinho" is the masculine singular diminutive noun form of "árcade", referring to a member of the Arcádia Lusitana, an 18th-century literary society (modelled after the Italian Accademia dell'Arcadia) that introduced Neoclassicism to the possessions of the Portuguese Empire (which included Brazil).
