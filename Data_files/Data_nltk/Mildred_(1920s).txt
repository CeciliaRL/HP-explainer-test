Mildred was an American No-Maj woman who lived in New York city in the 1920s.


== Biography ==
She was engaged to Jacob Kowalski in 1926. She left him after he returned from Steen National Bank without a loan to open his bakery.


== Physical appearance ==
Mildred in late 1926 was an attractive young woman with blonde hair, blue eyes and light skin.


== Personality and traits ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Mildred breaking up with Jacob 		 	 
While little is known about Mildred's personality, it can be assumed she was very money-oriented and selfish, and that she did not genuinely love Jacob Kowalski whilst engaged to him, as she immediately broke off their engagement when he failed to get a bank loan, showing she only really appeared to be interested in the financial side of their relationship.


== Behind the scenes ==
Mildred was portrayed by Sinead Matthews in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Her role was cut from the final version, but her scenes were included in the film's deleted scenes.
The scene had Jacob returning from the bank to 435 Rivington Street to find his fianc√©e waiting for him. Mildred runs to Jacob and asks how did it go and if he got the loan. He says that the bank did not give it to him, and she takes off their engagement ring and leaves him.
We do not know much about Mildred other than that she was engaged to muggle Jacob Kowalski and she was very poor.
