This individual (born c. 1974-1976) was a witch who, in the early 1990s was one of the Hufflepuff Prefects at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


== Biography ==

She attended breakfast in the Great Hall on the day of the Gryffindor vs. Ravenclaw Quidditch match, where she commented that Cedric had taken her writing quill.

She was patrolling the Third-floor corridor on the night of 4 June, 1992. When Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger passed by Peeves, she heard something and went to investigate.

She admired Harry Potter and, whenever she caught him sneaking around at night, she was surprised to find him there, breaking school rules just like "any other student" and even assuring him that the fact that she had to deduct him house points did not change the fact that she looked up to him as a hero.


== Behind the scenes ==
This NPC has the distinction of being one of the only Prefects that deducts House points whenever she is the target of a stray spell during the daytime hours â€” the other such Prefect is Percy Weasley.


== Appearances ==
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) (First appearance) (GBA version)
