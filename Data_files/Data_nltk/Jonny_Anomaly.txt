Jonny Anomaly was a Muggle magician in the early 20th century.
In 1926, posters were put up around New York's harbour promoting a series of twelve performances staged by G. Forbes Productions, which were slated to begin on Saturday 11 December. This included a show featuring the "amazing skills" of Jonny Anomaly. Another poster was put up advertising a performance by the "magnificent" Anomaly at the Packer Theatre on the same day.
