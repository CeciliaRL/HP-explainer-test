Mrs Abbott (d. 1996) was the mother of Hufflepuff student Hannah Abbott.


== Biography ==
During the Second Wizarding War, Mrs Abbott was found dead in her home. She was murdered by Death Eaters, followers of Lord Voldemort. When Hannah was informed of this during a sixth year Herbology class, she was removed from Hogwarts.


== Behind the scenes ==
Mrs Abbott may have been a Muggle or Muggle-born, as the Abbott family is a known pure-blood family yet Hannah was a half-blood, which would explain why she was killed by Death Eaters. However, it is possible that it was instead one of Hannah's grandparents that had the Muggle ancestry.
Alternatively, she may have been a supporter of Muggles or refused to assist the Death Eaters.
