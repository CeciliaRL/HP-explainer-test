Kouta Ohnishi was a wizard and Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s.


== Biography ==
During the 1996–1997 school year, he had to brew a Draught of Peace for Potions, but could not do so because he lacked the horned slugs that were one of the ingredients required to make the potion. He traded syrup of Hellebore with Harry Potter in order to get the horned slugs he needed. He was also a member of the Duelling Club.


== Etymology ==
The name "Kouta" is from Japanese 康 (kou) "peace" and 太 (ta) "thick, big".


== Behind the scenes ==
It is most likely that Kouta was in his fifth year in the 1996–1997 school year, as the Draught of Peace is usually brewed in that year.
Given his name, he is most likely of Japanese descent.
