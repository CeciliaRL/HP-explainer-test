This girl was a witch who fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. She was injured in an unknown manner, probably from a spell. During the hour long break in which the Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort ordered his Death Eaters to stop fighting, the girl was comforted by Ginny Weasley. She was scared and wanted to go home.


== Behind the scenes ==
As the girl is not known to be a member of Dumbledore's Army or the Gryffindor Quidditch team, it can be assumed that she was at school prior to the event.
In the second video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows during Surrender, Harry Potter came across some students while walking through the Viaduct Courtyard. One of them was a blonde-haired Hufflepuff girl with brown skin who says the same as this individual said. It is unknown if this is her, as she was not comforted by Ginny.
