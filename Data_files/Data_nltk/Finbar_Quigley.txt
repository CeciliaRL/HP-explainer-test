Finbar Quigley was a Quidditch player for the Ballycastle Bats. Finbar did not dare disagree with Gwenog Jones when she commented on the ever-increasing number of fans of the Holyhead Harpies for the Daily Prophet, for he feared being turned into a Wood lice.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is possible that Finbar Quigley is the Beater for the Irish National Quidditch team as they share the same last name and Ballycastle could refer to either the small town in Northern Ireland or the village in the Republic of Ireland. If so, it is likely that he plays Beater for the Ballycastle Bats.
