Kevin Hopwood was a wizard who was made the Gobstones World Champion at some point. Due to the lack of popularity the game of Gobstones has been having in latest years, the National Gobstone Association has attempted a recruitment campaign, "Give Gobstones A Second Glance", and issued a poster with an accompanying picture of Hopwood being squirted with an eyeful of gunk.
