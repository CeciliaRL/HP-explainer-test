The two brothers of Arthur Weasley were English pure-blood wizards. Their parents were Septimus and Cedrella Weasley (n√©e Black). At least one of them appears to have had children, as there were mentions of various Weasley cousins at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour in August of 1997.


== Behind the scenes ==
J. K. Rowling stated that Arthur had two brothers. They have not been named thus far.
In addition, an uncle of the Weasley children who attended Bill and Fleur's wedding, may have been one of Arthur's brothers.
When Harry Potter attended Bill and Fleur's wedding disguised as a red-haired Muggle boy, one of the Weasley uncles, who was intoxicated at the time, wondered if Harry was his son. This may mean that one of Arthur's brothers has at least one son, or he may have simply been extremely drunk.
Ron has an uncle Bilius who could be one of Arthur's brothers, or Molly might have another brother that we don't know about.
These individuals were not featured on the Weasley family tree shown on  Pottermore.
