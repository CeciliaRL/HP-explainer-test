Thornton Harkaway was an American wizard and the President of the Magical Congress of the United States of America.


== Biography ==
He opted to have the headquarters for the Magical Congress of the United States of America moved to his hometown of Williamsburg, Virginia in 1760. He was described as flamboyant. He bred Crups and unfortunately his pack savagely attacked several No-Majs, who afterwards were only able to bark for a period of 48 hours. This breach of the Statute of Secrecy led to him leaving office in disgrace.
It may not be a coincidence that the first dedicated psychiatric hospital was established in Williamsburg as odd sightings the Harkaway residence might account for many No-Majs who were admitted, but who were actually sane.
