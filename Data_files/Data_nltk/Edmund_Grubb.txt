Edmund Grubb was a ghost at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
He lived in the Victorian era, and died in the doorway of the Great Hall at Hogwarts Castle after ingesting poisonous berries. After his death, he returned as a ghost to haunt the Castle, sometimes stopping people from getting into the Great Hall out of spite.
