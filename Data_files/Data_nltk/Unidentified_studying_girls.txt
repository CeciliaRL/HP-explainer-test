These three girls were witches and students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They were seen studying and poring over books while they stood by the statue of the first Headmaster of Hogwarts. Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington then passed them, and they looked up briefly before returning to their reading. Percy Weasley and Penelope Clearwater then passed them as well.
