Cassiopeia Black (1915–1992) was a pure-blood witch, the eldest daughter of Cygnus Black II and Violetta Black (née Bulstrode) and sister of Pollux, Marius and Dorea. Cassiopeia never married or had any children.


== Behind the scenes ==
Based on a statement by Horace Slughorn, Cassiopeia may well have been a member of the Slytherin House.  She attended Hogwarts c. 1926–1933. Slughorn became Potions Master in 1931 when she would likely have been in her fifth or sixth year. She also would have been one of the first ever Slytherin students that Horace Slughorn taught when he joined in 1931.
Since Cassiopeia and Callidora were born in the same year, it is likely that they were classmates at Hogwarts.
Cassiopeia is a queen in Greek mythology, and her daughter is Andromeda. Another relative was Andromeda Tonks, a grand-niece of Cassiopeia Black.
Cassiopeia died two years after her brother Pollux and one after their cousin, and the same year as two other members of the Black family. At that time, Cassiopeia's grand-nephew (Sirius Black III) was in Azkaban.
On the family tree featured in the film, her first name is misspelt "Cassiapeia".


== Etymology ==
Like many members of the House of Black, Cassiopeia is named after a constellation. The constellation is in turn named after Queen Cassiopeia of Greek mythology, a beautiful but vain woman whose arrogant boasting led to her downfall. The name is derived from the Greek Κασσιόπη, meaning "she whose words excel".
