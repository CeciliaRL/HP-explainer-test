This Princess was the daughter of a monarch of a land during the Middle Ages. Leticia Somnolens, the local Hag, was jealous of this princess and tricked the Princess into pricking her finger on a spindle tainted with a Draught of Living Death, sending her into a deep sleep. A young wizard smeared his lips with Wiggenweld Potion, and then kissed the princess, curing her and bringing her out of the sleep. Her story appears to be the source of inspiration for the Muggle fairy tale, Sleeping Beauty.
