This individual was a Dark Wizard and Death Eater who fought at the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998.


== Biography ==
Upon procuring a wand and learning the Dark Arts, this wizard joined the Death Eaters and became a loyal follower and servant of Lord Voldemort. On 2 May 1998, he was called upon to fight in the Battle of Hogwarts, along with all his fellow Death Eaters. After the protective enchantments around the castle were broken, he came smashing in through a window in The Quad battlements to attack the defenders within via flight. Before he could harm anybody, he was hit by Momentum-reversing spell used by Kingsley Shacklebolt, which halted him right in his tracks then sent him flying back out the window, likely killing him in the subsequent fall.
