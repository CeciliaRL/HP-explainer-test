This individual was a Dark Wizard and Death Eater who guarded Hogsmeade Village in 1998 when Voldemort took control over the Ministry.


== Biography ==
He and another Death Eater were searching for Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger when the trio tried to find a safe place in the village.
He later fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, where he was seen participating in the Onslaught at the Viaduct, where he casts the Cruciatus Curse. He was later called back to the Forbidden Forest. He was also present at Voldemort's speech of Harry Potter's "dead" body. After Harry revealed himself to be alive, he was seen apparating away, although he was later seen inside the Great Hall, implying he was only transporting to the inside of the castle.
After Voldemort's defeat and death, he was possibly killed or imprisoned in Azkaban for his crimes as a Death Eater.
