Millford Quisling was a wizard and magical author and theoretician. Quisling published a treatise on the subject of spell-casting, where he posited the idea that a witch or wizard could draw energy from within themselves to augment their spellwork in a time of dire need. This treatise was ultimately discredited.
There was a copy of Quisling's work at the Restricted Section of Hogwarts Library. It was eventually found by a Calamity Investigator of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force that aspired to pursue a career as a Professor. Applying several of Quisling's ideas, they were successfully able to improve their use of the Inn Charm.
