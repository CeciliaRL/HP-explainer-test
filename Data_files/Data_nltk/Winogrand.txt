Sir Winogrand was a wizard and a herbologist who kept a wide collection of water plants in the African Lakes.


== Biography ==
Sometime before 1964, Selina Sapworthy accessed his collection and based on its large magical and scientific potential, wrote a book called Winogrand's Wondrous Water Plants. The book has been awarded the Herbology Book of the Year by the Herbology High Commission, and it has been part of the required reading at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for at least twenty-five years.
