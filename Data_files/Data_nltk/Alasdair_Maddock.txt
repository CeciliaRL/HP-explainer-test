Alasdair Maddock was a wizard and former Chaser for the Montrose Magpies who had what some people believed to have been a rather unsettling obsession with Muggle sports. He once tried to play football "for a laugh" and tried to incorporate it into Quidditch. Once, he tried to dribble the Quaffle like a basketball, and on another occasion, tried to hit the Quaffle with his head like a football player. He was later fired by the manager, Cormack McLeod, for playing golf in the summer of 1999.
