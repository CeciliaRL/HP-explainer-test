This individual was an ancestor of Daphne and Astoria Greengrass who was cursed with a blood malediction. The curse resurfaced after several generations in Astoria, and was responsible for her lifelong frailty and untimely death.


== Behind the scenes ==
The reason for the Astoria's ancestor being cursed with a blood malediction causing death and passed down to their descendant is unknown, nor is it known whether they deserved it or if they were killed by it.
Daphne Greengrass, Astoria Malfoy, and Scorpius Malfoy are the only confirmed descendants of this individual. However, in Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, it is revealed that Cereus Greengrass suffers from a blood malediction as well. It is unknown if this is the same blood malediction passed on by this common ancestor.
