William III (14 November 1650 â€“ 8 March 1702) was King of England, ruling jointly with his wife Queen Mary II from 1689 until her death in 1694, and thereafter as sole monarch until his own death in 1702.
When the British Ministry of Magic was begging for recognition and protection under Muggle law, William and Mary failed to send a delegation to them, which contributed to the introduction of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in 1692.
