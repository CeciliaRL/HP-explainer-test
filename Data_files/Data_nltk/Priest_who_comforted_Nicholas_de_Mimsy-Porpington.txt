This individual (fl. 1492) was a priest and the man who comforted Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington just before his execution on the dawn of 1492. Upon denying Sir Nicholas of wearing a hat (extravagant plumed hats were somewhat of a passion of his), the wizard knew his end was nigh.


== Behind the scenes ==
This individual is only mentioned on a self-penned ballad relaying the story of Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's death, that was supposed to make an appearance in the earlier drafts of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
