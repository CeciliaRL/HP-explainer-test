Calvin Coolidge (born John Calvin Coolidge Jr.) was an American No-Maj politician.


== Behind the scenes ==
He served as President of the United States of America during Newt Scamander's trip to New York City as well as Gellert Grindelwald's escape from MACUSA's prison the following year. His term in office (1923-1929) greatly overlapped with Seraphina Picquery's term as President of MACUSA (1920-1928)
As relations between American wizards and No-Majs were illegal at the time of his presidency, President Coolidge was unaware of the existence of the wizarding world.
President Coolidge served as Governor of Massachusetts prior to becoming Warren G Harding's vice president. Massachusetts is a prominent location for magical history and buildings in the United States, as it it home to Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, The Salem Witches' Institute, and was also the location of the Salem Witch Trials in the 1690s.
