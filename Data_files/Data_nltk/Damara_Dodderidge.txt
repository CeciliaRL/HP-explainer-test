== Biography ==


=== 1991-1992 ===
By 1991, she had a Portrait hung in Hogwarts Castle's Grand Staircase.


=== 1993-1994 ===
By 1993, she had a Portrait hung in Gryffindor Tower.


=== 1995-1996 ===
By 1995, she guarded a shortcut, leading from the Grand Staircase to the Clock Tower, she was seen frequently complaining about her hunger or tiredness. By then, her password was "Chops and Gravy".


=== 1996-1997 ===
In the next school year, Damara's portrait was moved to another place in the Grand Staircase. Despite this move, she still guarded a passage to the Clock Tower, inaccessible to all, who had not got the new password: "Dashing Cadogan".

On 2 May, 1998, the Battle of Hogwarts ensued. Damara appeared to have fled from her portrait.


== Personality and traits ==
Damara was known being always very hungry and tired. Many times she would ask fellow portrait Giffard Abbott for food. Her portrait at Hogwarts Castle depicts her like so, but by 1996 she seemed to stop constantly daydreaming about food and complaining about her tiredness. She said to be hungry once at breakfast time, though. Also by this time, she seemed to have developed a crush on fellow portrait Sir Cadogan, calling him "dashing".


== Etymology ==
Damara is the Celtic goddess of fertility.


== Behind the scenes ==
Damara is voiced by Rachel Atkins in the fifth video game while in the sixth game she is voiced by Beth Chalmers.
Damara Dodderidge may have died sometime prior to 1991, as many portraits hung at Hogwarts depict deceased individuals.
It is possible that Damara is related to Daisy Dodderidge, the famed founder and first landlady of The Leaky Cauldron.
Considering that she is named for the Celtic goddess of fertility, it may be that Damara Dodderidge's hunger and tiredness simply resulted from being pregnant.
Damara's portrait was based on a c. 1615 portrait of Lady Elizabeth Pope, by Robert Peake the Elder (c. 1551â€“1619).
