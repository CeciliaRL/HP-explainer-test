Charlie Baverstock was a wizard from New Zealand who worked as manager of the New Zealand National Quidditch team.
He proclaimed himself 'madder then a bloke who's been locked in a box of Fwoopers' after his Chaser Dennis Moon was sent off in the 106th minute of New Zealand's first round match against Bulgaria at the 2014 Quidditch World Cup. New Zealand lost the match 410 - 170.
