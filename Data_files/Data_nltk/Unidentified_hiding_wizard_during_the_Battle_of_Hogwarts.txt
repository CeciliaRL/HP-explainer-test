This individual was a wizard who fought during the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998. He was hiding behind some stones at the Viaduct Courtyard checkpoint towers when it exploded. It is possible that he was waiting for some Death Eater to pass by there, hoping to kill him from cover and without the risk of counter-attack. Another option is that he could be injured. It's unknown if he survived the battle.
