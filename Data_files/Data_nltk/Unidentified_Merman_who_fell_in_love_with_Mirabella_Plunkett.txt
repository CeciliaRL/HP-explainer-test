This merman fell in love with a young witch, Mirabella Plunkett.


== Biography ==
This merman lived in the waters of Loch Lomond, Scotland. At some point in his life, he met the young witch, Mirabella Plunkett who was on holiday in the area, and two subsequently fell in love. However, due to Mirabella being a human and him being a merman, Mirabella's parents strongly objected to their relationship and forbade her to marry him. However in response, Mirabella transfigured herself into a haddock, and was never seen by humans again. Therefore, it is possible that the two later married with them both inhabiting the waters as aquatic creatures.
