This wizard was appointed Headmaster of Hogwarts before Professor Dippet.


== Biography ==
This wizard became the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at an unknown point in history, although it is known his tenure was before that of Armando Dippet. After his death, his portrait was hung in the Headmaster's office, in order to give advice to the current head. At the top of his golden frame is printed "Seraphini Cherubini Throni" which translates roughly as "angelic cherub throne".
A portrait also hung in the Lower Chambers Portrait Corridor next to a Portrait of a bearded man holding a book in Hogwarts Castle during the 1993â€“1994 school year. He was portrayed to have been resting in an armchair.
