Hermes (fl. 1991-1995) was a screech owl belonging to Percy Weasley. Hermes was purchased for Percy by his father as a reward for becoming a Gryffindor prefect in his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
In 1993, Hermes was stacked along with Hedwig and other belongings at the Leaky Cauldron before the departure to King's Cross Station.
In 1995, Percy used Hermes to deliver a letter to his brother Ronald, advising him not to trust Harry Potter any longer and side with Dolores Umbridge and the British Ministry of Magic.


== Etymology ==
Hermes (Ἑρμής) was the messenger of the gods in Greek mythology. Coincidentally, this is also the origin of the name "Hermione". This is very fitting for Percy, as he and Hermione always got along well at school, and given Percy's pompous nature, he would prefer to name his owl after a divine messenger.
