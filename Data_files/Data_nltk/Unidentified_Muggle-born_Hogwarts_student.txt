== Biography ==


=== Early life (Before 2008) ===
This individual was born to a Muggle family between 1996 and 1997. During their childhood, their latent magical abilities often surfaced, which they believed was unusual, despite their parents being amused and not taking it seriously.
During the summer of 2008, Rubeus Hagrid, the Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, paid them a visit and delivered the Hogwarts acceptance letter. Being a Muggle-born, they were escorted to Diagon Alley by Hagrid on his flying motorbike to purchase their school stuff. They first went to Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions to dress themselves up, and then Ollivanders to purchase their wand. Hagrid also invited them to the Eeylops Owl Emporium and gifted them an owl. When they were ready to return home, Hagrid's motorbike had trouble starting, so they used the London Underground.
When they arrived at King's Cross Station on 1 September, they were unsure how to find Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. Just then, Harry Potter, whose identity was unknown to them, tapped them on the shoulder and instructed them to run straight into the wall between Platform Nine and Ten. They successfully boarded the Hogwarts Express and arrived at Hogsmeade station, after which they crossed the Great Lake on a boat with other first-years and reached the Hogwarts Castle.


=== Hogwarts years (2008â€“2015) ===


==== First year ====


===== Sorting Ceremony =====
Headmistress McGonagall led them into the Great Hall and delivered a speech, mentioning a grumpy ghoul having taken up residence in an empty classroom on the third floor, and assuring students that while they would hopefully never face such evil as in the Battle of Hogwarts, should challenges arise, the joint forces of them would be truly powerful. The Sorting Ceremony followed, during which they were sorted into a House they preferred. Ivy Warrington was at first not present at the ceremony, but she was later brought forward by Hagrid, who explained she had gotten distracted by bushes outside the castle, and was sorted into the same House. After the ceremony, they enjoyed the Start-of-Term Feast and got a good night's rest.


===== First lessons =====
For their first lessons at Hogwarts, they studied the Levitation Charm in Professor Flitwick's Charms class and brewing the Hair-Raising Potion in Professor Slughorn's Potions class. Between the classes, they heard several students in a corridor talking about Ron Weasley's defeat of a Troll using nothing but the Levitation Charm in his first year. When the students blocked Cassandra Vole's way to Potions class, she brusquely told them to move.
In Potions class, when rat tails were missing, they managed to retrieve some from the Dungeons, but encountered an Acromantula, which they quickly defeated.


===== Duelling Club =====
After classes, they witnessed several students practising advanced Transfiguration spells in their common room, which inspired them to visit the Library to learn more spells. There, they saw Robyn Thistlethwaite attempting to cast Sectumsempra and Incarcerous on a copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, but she didn't quite succeed and the book was angered. Hagrid came, picked up and calmed the book down, and suggested the first-years visit the Duelling Club to master the incantations. There, they gave duelling a try, opposing Cassandra Vole and Fischer Frey.


===== Exploring the Forbidden Forest =====
Ivy wanted to collect some potion ingredients for Daniel Page by looking for them in the Forbidden Forest. Kevin Farrell didn't feel safe but Ivy said the only things they should look for were some Jobberknoll feathers, snowdrop and sage. They found some thyme right away, and they and Ivy decided to go further into the Forest to look for the other ingredients. During their adventure, they encountered some magical creatures and an individual battling a Norwegian Ridgeback, which they also had to fight after the said individual Disapparated. They found some snowdrop right where the dragon had been.


===== Attending a ball =====
They met Robyn and Kevin at a school ball, who had been dancing together and encouraged them to also invite a partner to dance.


===== Finding Ivy Warrington =====
At night, they and other two students met Professor McGonagall, who had discovered that Ivy went missing. On the Grand Staircase, they met Robyn Thistlethwaite who was looking for Ivy as well and had already arranged a search party. The party consisted of Robyn, Daniel and Kevin, who had met in the Library. Daniel was definite he wouldn't want to risk wandering around the castle in the middle of the night, but Kevin was convinced to do the search with them.
The students arrived at the Potions Classroom and Robyn liberated several spiders, which took a while for them to defeat. They went back to the revolving Grand Staircase and encountered Peeves, who stirred up another fight. Kevin got lost in the process, and Daniel came to call them back. Suddenly, they saw Mr Filch, and in a panic, they entered the Charms Classroom which had a "KEEP OUT" sign on the door. There, they encountered another copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, and to make things worse, Robyn used the Engorgement Charm on it to get a better look. When the book was finally struck down, Robyn was nowhere to be seen either.
They arrived at the seventh-floor corridor beside the Troll Tapestry, and when they thought about the situation and paced back and forth, they accidentally triggered the door to the Room of Requirement. Ivy was found in the room and told her story of feeling being followed and looking for a place to hide, and judging by how Ivy seemed to be oblivious to the details, they thought she might have been cursed. Before leaving, they discovered a trunk with the word "WW", and when it was left alone, a white hand reached out from it.


===== Rescuing Gossamer =====
In the common room, Ivy showed Daniel how to properly cast the Levitation Charm, and they also tried the Hardening Charm and the Disarming Charm. When Daniel went to retrieve his wand, he saw an object inside a secret hole in a wall, which turned out to contain a portrait of a small knight. Lottie realised it wasn't moving, and a voice emanated from it saying "help me". They used the Revealing Charm and revealed chains trapping the knight. Just then, Peeves showed up and tried to destroy the portrait, but was defeated by them. The chains were broken, allowing the knight to travel among other portraits. He introduced himself as Gossamer, who was cursed and hidden away for years, and he was delighted to become the students' "loyal friend and dutiful guide" by moving through other portraits to update and alert them. He then went off to visit his old friends.
The portrait around the castle became upset because of Gossamer's mischievous activities. An angry wizard's portrait recalled how the portraits had decided to remove Gossamer from the general population, and that a student had done the lock on his portrait. In order to repair the man's portrait frame, Daniel decided to unlock Filch's tool chest, but released some rats instead. They quickly took them down, and helped repair the portrait. Daniel and Ivy had a difference of opinion on the treatment that Gossamer had received, and they agreed with Ivy, but were worried that Gossamer would be locked up again if he caused more trouble.
They and their friends found Gossamer, who said a witch or wizard he had been talking to went missing and suggested them organise a search party. They and Daniel didn't think it was necessary because the said witch or wizard had probably intended to get away from him, which left Gossamer heart-broken. They were soon discovered by Filch, whose contraption malfunctioned and released a trio of Red Caps, who were defeated by them. Gossamer was moved and acknowledge they were his friends. When he suggested himself being put in a more secluded place, they placed him in their common room.
