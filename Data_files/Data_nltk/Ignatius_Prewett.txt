Ignatius Prewett was a pure-blood wizard who married Lucretia Black. He was an uncle by blood of Fabian and Gideon Prewett, as well as their sister Molly, and an uncle by marriage of Sirius and Regulus Black. Ignatius and his wife Lucretia did not have any children of their own. 
Given that Molly gave her third son Percy the middle name "Ignatius", presumably in honour of her uncle, it is likely that she and Ignatius were close.


== Behind the scenes ==
Ignatius is a Roman name altered from its original Etruscan to resemble the Latin ignis, "fire". It was the name of several saints, including the founder of the Jesuits.
Given that Lucretia Black from the Black Family was not disowned and burnt off the Black Family Tree, implies that her marriage to Ignatius Prewett was a "respectable" pure-blood marriage.
