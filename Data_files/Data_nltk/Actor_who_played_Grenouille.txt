This individual was an actor who played the part of Grenouille in a disastrous performance of Malecrit's classic wizarding play Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré Les Pieds. The names of the actors of this particular performance were not recorded and, as such, are unknown to history.
This individual's performance, alongside the performance of the wizard who played Crapaud, was not particularly appealing and, as such, the bored audience spent much of act one throwing pumpkins at them.
During the eponymous foot-transfiguration scene, the special effects wizard tried to liven up the play by conjuring a stream of flames instead of the puff of yellow smoke he was supposed to conjure. The actor playing Grenouille was on-stage at the time, and fled in panic with the rest of the cast when the curtains caught alight, setting the whole theatre ablaze.
