The name Ursula means "little bear", derived from the Latin word ursa, "she-bear", which gives its name to two constellations associated with the Greek myth of Callisto, a nymph who was turned into a bear. Saint Ursula was a legendary Roman-British princess who was martyred by the Huns while returning from a pilgrimage in the fourth century.
