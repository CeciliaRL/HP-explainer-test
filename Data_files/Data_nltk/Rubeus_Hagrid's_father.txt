Mr Hagrid (d. 1941/1942) was a wizard who was Rubeus Hagrid's father and the first husband of Fridwulfa. He was short, not only in comparison to his giantess wife and half-giant son, but by human standards as well.

 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Rubeus and his father 		 	 
Nothing is known of Mr Hagrid's life before he married the giantess Fridwulfa, who gave birth to their son Rubeus (a half-giant) on 6 December 1928. 
Fridwulfa was disappointed with their son's small stature and left the family when Rubeus was three years old, leaving Mr Hagrid heartbroken.
Mr Hagrid raised his son alone. By the time Rubeus was six, he was large and strong enough to lift his father up onto a dresser if Mr Hagrid annoyed him.
Mr Hagrid was at first unsure whether Rubeus could be a wizard, considering his giant blood, but he was delighted when Rubeus received his Hogwarts acceptance letter in 1940. By that point, Rubeus could carry his father on his shoulders, and Mr Hagrid was described as "beaming" in a photograph taken of them together. Mr Hagrid died when Rubeus was in his second year at Hogwarts, and therefore he never knew about his son's expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry the next year.
