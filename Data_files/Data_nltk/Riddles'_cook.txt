== Biography ==


=== Cook for the Riddles ===
This woman served the Riddle family in the capacity of a cook. She probably lived in the Riddle House along with other employees. She tried many times to get acquainted with fellow employee Frank Bryce, but the man turned her down, preferring solitary work.


=== The Riddle Murders ===
Many town residents gathered at The Hanged Man to gossip on the night the Riddles were murdered in 1943. It was her who brought the news about the arrest of the Riddles' gardener, Frank Bryce, after quite a dramatic entrance, and was subsequently bought more and more sherries by the pub patrons, eager to hear more. She suspected Bryce did it, pointing out how easily he could have done it, since he had a set of spare keys to the house, and there was no evidence of a forceful entry.
