This individual (d. 1 May, 1998) was a Dark Wizard and one of Lord Voldemort's Death Eaters who participated in the Second Wizarding War.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
This Death Eater was presumably born prior to 1981. He would have been a half-blood or pure-blood wizard, as his master Lord Voldemort was an extreme pure-blood supremacist who despised and sought to eradicate Muggles and Muggle-borns, along with blood traitors. It is also highly possible that he fought for Voldemort during the First Wizarding War. 


=== Second Wizarding War ===
This Death Eater raided the Hogwarts Express on 1 September, 1997, in order to search the train for Harry Potter with another Death Eater. At the time, both the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts were under the control of Lord Voldemort. He was, however, unsuccessful in his search for Potter, as he, along with Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, were on a mission to find and destroy Voldemort's Horcruxes at the time, and did not return to Hogwarts for their final year of education at the school.
