Aristotle Twelvetrees was an American wizard. He served as Keeper of Treasure and Dragots during the presidency of Emily Rappaport in the late 18th century, and was apparently good at his job, being described as a "competent man."


== Biography ==
He had a daughter, Dorcus, who did not take after him. She did poorly at Ilvermorny and was still living with him at the time he took office. Her fraternisation with the No-Maj Bartholomew Barebone lead to one of the greatest breaches of the International Statute of Secrecy in history and prompted the passage of Rappaport's Law.
