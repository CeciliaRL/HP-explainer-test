This uncle of the Weasley children got drunk at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour on 1 August, 1997. He spent part of the wedding wondering whether or not Harry Potter, who was disguised as a red-haired Weasley cousin, was his son.


== Behind the scenes ==
As it is known that Arthur Weasley had two brothers and no sisters, it is widely assumed that the unnamed "uncle of Ron's" mentioned in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is one of Arthur's brothers, and thus a Weasley. However, since it is unknown whether Gideon and Fabian Prewett were Molly Weasley's only siblings, it is possible the unnamed uncle was another brother of Molly or the husband of her sister.
