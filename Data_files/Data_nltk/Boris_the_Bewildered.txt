Boris the Bewildered was a wizard from an unknown time period. 


== History ==
A statue of him stands on the fifth floor of Hogwarts Castle, near the Prefects' bathroom. His statue featured a lost-looking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands. A portrait of Boris also hung on Hogwarts' walls, guarding a secret passageway between the second floor corridor and the third floor corridor. The password was Forget-Me-Never.


== Behind the scenes ==
Boris died sometime prior to 1995, as portraits hung at Hogwarts depict deceased individuals.


== Etymology ==
"Boris" is from the Turkic name Bogoris, perhaps meaning "short" or "wolf".
