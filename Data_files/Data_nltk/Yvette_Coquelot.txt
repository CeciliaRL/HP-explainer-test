Madame Yvette Coquelot (fl. 1869) was a French Muggle who presumably ran an establishment in 69 Boulevard des Galantes, in Paris. There was a plaque at The Seven Swans pub in Godric's Hollow requesting patrons to "discharge their weapons before entering", crediting Mme Coquelot as its original owner.


== Etymology ==
Yvette is the female form of the name Yves meaning Yew tree.
Yvette is also Quebec term for a docile obedient housewife who votes against sovereignty [1] [2].
Coquelot is likely a contracted form of the word coquelicot or a variant of coquelet meaning small cockerel or male baby chick [3]. The word coquelicot means "poppy" since poppies are red like a rooster's chest [4].  The French word for rooster is coq.
