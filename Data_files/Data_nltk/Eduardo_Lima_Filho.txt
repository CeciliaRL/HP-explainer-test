== Behind the scenes ==
This character was named after Eduardo Lima, a graphic artist who worked on every Harry Potter film from Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban onward.
In accordance with the Portuguese naming conventions, the suffix "Filho" is added to the name with initial upper case and without a separating comma, whenever someone is named after their father (in a similar way as "Jnr." is used in the English-speaking world). This practise is most common in Brazil.
