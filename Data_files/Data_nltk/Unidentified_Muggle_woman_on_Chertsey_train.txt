This Muggle woman was travelling to Chertsey on a train, but fell asleep (something she apparently does often), and woke up having arrived at King's Cross Station in London on 1 September, 1992. Her arrival to the incorrect destination was made more irksome when, while waiting near Platform Ten, she stepped in some old chewing gum.
