Borf was a male werewolf offspring of the Forbidden Forest wolf pack.


== Biography ==
As a member of the Forbidden Forest pack, Borf was descended from two werewolves who mated while in wolf form during a full moon, an extremely rare occurrence. Unlike humans affected with Lycanthropy, such wolves do not transform and are not any more savage than standard wolves while being extremely intelligent and beautiful.
One day, Borf followed Chiara Lobosca out of the Forbidden Forest. He continued to live in the forest, but frequently visited Chiara, whom he had befriended. The cub was named Borf as that was what the sound he made sounded like.
When a worker of the Werewolf Capture Unit, Cecil Lee came to investigate Hogwarts following a werewolf attack, Chiara and Rubeus Hagrid showed Borf as an example of a non-violent werewolf. Jacob's sibling, who was also there, was confused.
Later, in the 1988â€“1989 school year, Jacob's sibling and Rowan Khanna came to to the Forbidden Forest to play with Borf in order to help Rowan calm down before their O.W.L.s.
