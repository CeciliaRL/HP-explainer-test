Wilfred Elphick (1112-1199) was the first wizard to be gored by an African Erumpent, which is an extremely unlikely event, given the fact that the horn of an Erumpent almost always explodes on contact, due to the fluid it contains. On his Chocolate Frog Card, he was shown in bandages, showing he survived this attack.


== Etymology ==
Wilfred means "wanting peace," from the Old English wil, "desire," and fred, "peace." The surname Elphick derived from the Old English given name Aelfheah, which meant "high elf," from aelf, "elf," and heah, "high."
