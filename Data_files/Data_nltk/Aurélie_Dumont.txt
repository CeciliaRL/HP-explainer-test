== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Aurélie attended Beauxbatons Academy of Magic, where she constantly felt overshadowed by her brother, Davet Dumont.


==== Visiting Hogwarts ====
At one point during the 1985–1986 school year, Aurélie visited Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, supposedly considering a transfer. Penny introduced her to Jacob's sibling, who proceeded to give her a tour of the castle alongside Rowan Khanna. However, they soon noticed that Aurélie was acting suspicious and seemed to be searching the school for an item. When confronted by Jacob's sibling, Aurélie admitted that she came to Hogwarts hoping to find an Alchemy-related artefact.
After reading about alchemy, Aurélie and Jacob's sibling realised that the artefact was most likely a chalice that belonged to Nicolas Flamel. However, they soon were asked to visit Albus Dumbledore's office, where he encouraged Aurélie to stop comparing herself to her brother and informed her that if the chalice did exist, it was not hidden at Hogwarts. She decided to pursue Alchemy not to outdo her brother, but because she enjoyed the subject. Afterwards, she said good-bye to Jacob's sibling and Penny, and returned to Beauxbatons.
