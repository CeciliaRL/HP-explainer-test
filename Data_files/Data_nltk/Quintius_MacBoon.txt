Quintius MacBoon was a wizard and the head of the MacBoon clan. According to legend, he killed the head of the McClivert clan, Dugald McClivert in a drunken duel. The death led to the McClivert clan transfiguring the MacBoons into extremely dangerous flesh-eating beasts known as Quintapeds, presumably including Quintius.
