Snowy was one of Arabella Figg's pet cats. The other three were Mr Tibbles, Mr Paws and Tufty. Whenever Harry Potter got sent to her house on the Dursleys orders, she would show him pictures of all her cats, which he did not find terribly entertaining. Most likely, they were actually Kneazles or part Kneazles.
