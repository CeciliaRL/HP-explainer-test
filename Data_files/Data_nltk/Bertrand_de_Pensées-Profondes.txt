Bertrand de Pensées-Profondes was a French wizard and a noted and highly-regarded wizarding philosopher. He was the author of the celebrated work A Study into the Possibility of Reversing the Actual and Metaphysical Effects of Natural Death, with Particular Regard to the Reintegration of Essence and Matter. He was sceptical of the concept of restoring the soul to a living body, remarking that it will never happen and people should accept death.
