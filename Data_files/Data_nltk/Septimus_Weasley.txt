Septimus Weasley was a pure-blood wizard who married Cedrella Black. Because he was considered to be a blood traitor by the Black family, the marriage caused Cedrella's disownment from the Black family tree. The couple had three sons, including Arthur Weasley. He was the father-in-law of Molly Weasley, paternal grandfather of Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred, George, Ron and Ginny Weasley, great-grandfather to James, Albus and Lily Potter, Victoire, Dominique, Louis, Molly II, Lucy, Fred and Roxanne Weasley and Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley.


== Etymology ==
Septimus is a name of Latin origin. It means seventh.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is possible that Septimus was sorted in Gryffindor house, as his son and seven of his grandchildren were sorted into Gryffindor.
Septimus is a Roman name meaning "seventh" in Latin. This is interesting, considering that seven is the most magically powerful number, and that Septimus Weasley's son Arthur went on to have seven children. The name "Septimus" is usually given to a seventh-born son, so it can be assumed that Septimus Weasley had six older brothers.
Bilius may be another of Septimus and Cedrella's sons; however this cannot be confirmed, as it is only known that he was the uncle of Ron and his siblings, not whether he was born a Weasley or a Prewett.
Septimus was probably the previous owner of Ron Weasley's Wizard Chess set, as Ron's set was described to be a hand-me-down from one of his grandfathers, though it might have probably been from his maternal grandfather.
Ironically there was a member of the Malfoy family with the name Septimus. Both families would become enemies during the twentieth century.
