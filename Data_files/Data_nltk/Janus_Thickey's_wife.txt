Mrs Thickey (fl. 1973) was the wife of Janus Thickey. When, in 1973, her husband faked his own death by pretending that a Lethifold had eaten him, she and her children entered a period of mourning. However, their mourning was cut short when Janus was found to be living five miles away, with the landlady of the Green Dragon.
