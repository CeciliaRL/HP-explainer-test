Adrian Tutley was a wizard and an Animagus who could transform himself into a gerbil.


== Biography ==
In recent times, Tutley attended the International Symposium of Animagi, and, considering himself one of the far more experienced attendees, was outraged when a team of fourteen-year old students from Uagadou School of Magic led an exhibition of synchronised transforming into animals such as elephants and cheetahs. Tutley even went on to lodge a formal complaint with the International Confederation of Wizards because of this.
