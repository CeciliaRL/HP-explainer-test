This grubby-looking warlock came into St Mungo's in 1995 because he clanged like a bell whenever he moved. With each of the clangs, he vibrated so much that he had to grab hold of his ears to keep his head steady. He was sat in the corner of the reception area when Harry Potter, Mad-Eye Moody, Nymphadora Tonks and the Weasley family went to see Arthur Weasley.
