Basil Ardent Aurelius III was a wizard scholar. There was a portrait of him inside the Hogwarts Castle.


== Biography ==
The portrait of Basil Ardent Aurelius III had once been placed at the Hogwarts Grand Staircase, but was moved to the Chamber of Secrets during the Battle of Hogwarts.
During the 2009â€“2010 school year, a group of students, in search of a map that would lead to a family heirloom, went down to the chamber following Prentiss Pagett-Goggins's clue and heard him asking for help. After meeting them, he said the heirloom was in a secret passage, but the only person who knew where was his friend Harold, who had left Hogwarts before he came down here and was now in the Hog's Head Inn. He then noticed Bly far off in the chamber and mistook him to also be one of the group, leading to Bly animating one of the snake statues to attack the students. Basil was later returned to the Grand Staircase and reunited with his neighbours, namely Prentiss Pagett-Goggins and Harold, after the students found them and returned them to their original place.
