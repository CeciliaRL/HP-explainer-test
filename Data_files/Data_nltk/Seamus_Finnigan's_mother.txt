Mrs Finnigan (fl. 1980-1997) was an Irish witch.
She married Mr Finnigan, a Muggle, before she told him she was a witch, and it was a "bit of a nasty shock for him" when she told him after the wedding. The two had a son named Seamus.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Being Irish, she presumably attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, likely being sorted into Gryffindor. She was a fan of Quidditch, supporting the Irish National Quidditch team.
She met and fell in love with Mr Finnigan, a Muggle, marrying him without telling him that she was a witch. At some point after the Finnigans' wedding, she told him that she was a witch, which proved a "nasty shock" to him. They had a half-blood son named Seamus, who went on to study at Hogwarts.
Mrs Finnigan told Seamus that ghouls were scarier than they were dangerous.


=== 1994 ===
Mrs Finnigan took Seamus and his friend, Dean Thomas, to Roberts's campsite to watch the 1994 Quidditch World Cup final between Ireland and Bulgaria. The Finnigans' tent was covered in shamrocks, and located near several similarly-decorated ones. The Ministry of Magic was displeased with the decoration, but Mrs Finnigan believed that they had the right to show their colours, pointing out the Viktor Krum posters being hung by the supporters of Bulgaria.
At the campsite, Mrs Finnigan met Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, though it is unknown if she knew who Harry was at the time. She asked the trio if they were supporting Ireland, eyeing them beadily before their confirmation.


=== 1995 ===
A reader of The Daily Prophet, Mrs Finnigan believed the series of slander and lies they printed against Harry Potter and Albus Dumbledore in the summer of 1995. She did not want Seamus to return to the school that year as a result, believing that Dumbledore was incapable of acting as headmaster. However, she relented, and allowed him to.


=== 1996 ===
Seamus sent a copy of The Quibbler to his mother in 1996 to sway her into believing Harry over The Daily Prophet.


=== 1997 ===
After Dumbledore's death and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower in June 1997, Mrs Finnigan attempted to take Seamus home. However, he refused, leading to a loud argument between them in the Entrance Hall before she agreed to allow him to stay for the funeral. Mrs Finnigan encountered considerable difficulty finding somewhere to stay in Hogsmeade, due to the large amount of witches and wizards wishing to attend the funeral.
When Voldemort made Hogwarts attendance compulsory after he took over the Ministry, Mrs Finnigan was forced to send Seamus to school for the 1997-1998 school year.
It is unknown whether Voldemort's control of the Ministry affected Irish wizards as strongly as it affected English, Scottish, and Welsh wizards, but if it did, Mrs Finnigan might have been under suspicion for her marriage to a muggle and her son's participation in Dumbledore's Army.


== Physical description ==
Mrs Finnigan was a white woman with sandy-coloured hair, much like her son's.


== Personality and traits ==
Mrs Finnigan was said to be able to shiftily manipulate others into giving out information. She was likeable and worried for her son, not wanting him to stay at Hogwarts while under the impression that Dumbledore was unstable or after the Battle of the Astronomy Tower. Ron Weasley noted that telling Mrs Finnigan that he was anything but an Ireland fan would not have ended well for him.


== Behind the scenes ==
Given Fergus's magical ability, it is likely that he was related by blood to Mrs Finnigan, which would mean that she had at least one sibling.
