This individual (born c. 1878) was among the crowd of Quidditch fans present at the announcement of the ban on Stooging by the Department of Magical Games and Sports on 21 June, 1884. Much like the rest of the crowd present, this boy expressed his displeasure at the ban, telling a Daily Prophet reporter that he liked "watching them Keepers flattened" and that the announcement made him not "want to go to Quidditch no more".
