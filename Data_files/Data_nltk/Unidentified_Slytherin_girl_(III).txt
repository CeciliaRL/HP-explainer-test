== Behind the scenes ==
She was portrayed by Charlotte Ritchie in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, this student is shown to be present in the same Defence Against the Dark Arts class with the trio, regarding the Unforgivable Curses. However, her appearance in this lesson cannot be considered canon, as the book clearly states that this specific lesson was only for Gryffindor students.
She may possibly be Daphne Greengrass, Tracey Davis, Millicent Bulstrode, Emma Vane, Sophie Roper, Lily Moon, or Sally-Anne Perks.
