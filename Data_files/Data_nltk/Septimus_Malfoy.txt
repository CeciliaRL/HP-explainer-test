Septimus Malfoy was a pure-blood wizard who lived during the late 18th century. He was influential in the Ministry of Magic, and many claimed that when he served as an advisor, the Minister for Magic Unctuous Osbert was little more than his puppet.


== Etymology ==
Septimus is a Latin word for "seventh." This naming may be an attempt to draw reference to the powerful magical properties of the number seven.


== Behind the scenes ==
In 1992, Harry Potter, speaking about Draco Malfoy, said, "Look at his family... The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin, he's always boasting about it". This indicates that Septimus was most likely a Slytherin if he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, though it cannot be confirmed.
In 1997 a portrait was hung in Malfoy Manor showing a wizard; Septimus may be that wizard.
Oddly, Septimus is a name that also appears on the Weasley family tree, an almost rival family of the Malfoys in later years.
The relationship between Septimus and Unctuous Osbert is similar to that of his descendent Lucius Malfoy and Cornelius Fudge.
