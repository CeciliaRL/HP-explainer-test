She was the first witch ever to fly across the Atlantic Ocean on a broomstick, in 1935. This made her, and the broomstick she flew across the Atlantic with, the Oakshaft 79, famous throughout the Wizarding world.
There was a bust of Sykes at the Hogwarts Castle's Entrance Hall, near the stairway leading to the Dungeons.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Flying: Sykes was a highly accomplished and gifted broomstick flyer, being the first witch in wizarding history to fly across the Atlantic Ocean on a broom, an achievement for which she was immortalised on a Chocolate Frog Card.


== Behind the scenes ==
Jocunda is possibly the wizard counterpart of Amelia Earhart, who is famous for flying across the Atlantic on a plane, the first woman to do so.
In the Danish version of the second game her name is misspelt "Jocunca Sykes".
The etymology of her first name, from the Latin for "congenial" or "delightful", is the source of the English jocund, generally suggesting a cheerful and carefree approach to life. Also, her last name is an anagram for "skies", though the "i" has been replaced by a "y" in order to make it look more like a well-respected name.
