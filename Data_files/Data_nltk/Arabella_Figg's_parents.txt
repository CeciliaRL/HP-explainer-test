These individuals were the parents of the Squib Arabella Figg.


== Biography ==
On 12 August 1995, during the Disciplinary hearing of Harry Potter, Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge asked Arabella to give information about her parentage to the ministry later after the end of the hearing, asking her to report to Percy Weasley.


== Behind the scenes ==
As Arabella is a Squib, she must have had wizarding parentage, meaning at least one of them was a wizard. It's unknown if Arabella's mother was a witch, her father was a wizard, or if they were both magical.
Figg may have been Arabella's married name. It is therefore unknown whether or not it was her parents name as well.
