This individual (fl. 1997) was a wizard and a Snatcher during the height of the Second Wizarding War. According to Ronald Weasley, this individual smelt badly either meaning he had poor personal hygiene and/or that he had troll ancestry.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
This was born sometime in or before 1980, most likely to a Pure or Half-blood family, somewhere in the British Isles. He might have troll ancestry, as noted by Ronald Weasley in 1997. He most likely acquired his wand prior to his magical education. After the Death Eater coup over the Ministry of Magic, he joined a Snatcher chapter.


=== As a Snatcher ===
In December, 1997, this Snatcher's gang caught Ronald Weasley, who had abandoned Harry Potter and Hermione Granger during their quest to destroy Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. After telling them he was Stan Shunpike, Ron managed to distract them enough so that he took back his wand, as well as this individual's and Disapparated from the place.
After the Second Wizarding War, this individual was likely captured and arrested for his crimes against Muggle-borns under Kingsley Shacklebolt's de-corrupted Ministry of Magic.
