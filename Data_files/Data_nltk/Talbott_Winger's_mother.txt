Talbott Winger's mother was a witch who opposed Lord Voldemort during the First Wizarding War, though neither she nor Talbott's father joined any defence organisation.


== Biography ==
At some point in her life, she trained to become Healer, and worked as one at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, a wizarding hospital in London. She was also an Animagus, and in preparation for an attack, taught her son how to become one.
She grew pumpkins in her garden.
She and her husband were vehemently opposed to the Dark Wizard Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters reign of terror across Great Britain, although she and her husband for some reason did not join the Order of the Phoenix. One day, she and Talbott's father were murdered by Death Eaters, though their son managed to escape, due to Animagus ability to transform into an Eagle at will, allowing him to fly away to safety.
In the 1986â€“1987 school year, Barnaby Lee made up the claim that Talbott's mother was a Mermaid.


== Personality and traits ==
She was evidently a mothering and kind soul, as shown by her work as a Healer, and by nurturing upbringing of her son. She evidently loved and cared about her son Talbott immensely and his welfare, as she taught her son to become an Animagus, in order to help him escape danger should he have needed to, an ability which saved her son's life. She was also clearly a very powerful and accomplished witch in her own right, as shown by her career path and her very remarkable ability to have become an Animagus.
