Mrs Ross was a Scottish witch and she and her husband had at least one child, Isobel.
When Isobel became romantically involved with a Muggle neighbour, Robert McGonagall, she knew her parents would not approve, and thus she chose to keep the relationship a secret. Eventually, the young couple eloped, provoking the Ross' anger to the extent that they completely cut off ties with their daughter.
