Gon√ßalo Flores was a Brazilian wizard and a Chaser for the 2014 Brazilian National Quidditch team, along with Alejandra Alonso and Fernando Diaz.


== Biography ==
All three Chasers were highly commended for their performance during both the Brazil versus Haiti match, where they made thirty attempts to score during the beginning of the game, as well as during the Brazil versus Wales match where Ginny Potter complimented them on their solid performance and ability to keep their heads during the most contentious game in the tournament up to that point.
According to Ginny, her son Albus Potter was a fan of Flores, and thus supported Brazil in the finals, unlike his father and siblings. At one point during the match, Flores scored and Albus nearly fell out of the VIP box in excitement, but was caught by his uncle Ron (this account comes, however, from Rita Skeeter, so it must be taken with a grain of salt, as it is likely somewhat exaggerated).
