Irma Black (née Crabbe) (fl. 1925-1938) was an English pure-blood witch who was the wife of Pollux Black, the mother of Walburga Black, Alphard Black, and Cygnus Black III, (through her first child) the maternal grandmother of Sirius Black and Regulus Black, and (through her third child) the paternal grandmother of Bellatrix Lestrange, Andromeda Tonks, and Narcissa Malfoy.
Irma may also be a relative of Vincent Crabbe and his father.

 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Irma’s husband Pollux and son Cygnus on the Black family tree tapestry 		 	 
Irma is a German short form of names beginning with the Old Germanic element ermen, meaning "whole" or "universal". 


== Behind the scenes ==
Irma was possibly a member of Slytherin house as a Hogwarts student, like the rest of her family.
It is possible that Irma had a niece: Araminta Meliflua. This is presumed as Walburga Black (Irma’s daughter) was first cousin of Araminta. Pollux Black (Irma’s husband) had three siblings, only one is known to have married and had a son.
