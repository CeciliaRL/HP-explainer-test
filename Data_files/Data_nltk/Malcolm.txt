Malcolm was a Muggle who was a friend of Dudley Dursley and became a member of Dudley Dursley's gang. It is unknown if he learned that Dudley Dursley had started to show a little kindness to Harry or if he went into hiding when the Death Eaters attacked.


== Etymology ==
The name "Malcolm" comes from Scottish MÃ¡el Coluim which means "disciple of Saint Columba". This was the name of four kings of Scotland starting in the 10th century, including Malcolm III, who became king after killing Macbeth, the usurper who had murdered his father. The character Malcolm in Shakespeare's tragedy Macbeth (1606) is based on him.
