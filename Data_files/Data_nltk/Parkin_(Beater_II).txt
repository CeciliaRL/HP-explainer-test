Parkin (fl. 1422) was a Scottish witch or wizard who played as a Beater for the original Wigtown Wanderers team during the 15th century and was a child of Wanderers founder Walter Parkin. They were a formidable team during this time who won most of their matches, perhaps partly because Walter himself used to attend every game holding his wand in one hand and a meat cleaver in the other.
