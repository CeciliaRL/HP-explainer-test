Cliodna, also known as Cliodne, was a famous medieval Irish witch and druidess.


== Biography ==
An Animagus with the ability to turn into a sea bird, she was aided by three magical birds that cured the sick by singing them to sleep. It was also said that she could turn into a wave. She also discovered the properties of Moondew. Cliodne appeared on a Chocolate Frog Card.
In September of 1991, Harry Potter picked up a Chocolate Frog Card with a picture of Cliodna, who was scratching her nose.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Potions: Cliodna was highly proficient with potions, as she discovered a new ingredient, Moondew and its properties in potion-making. Furthermore, she would have needed to have brewed the Animagus potion in order for her to gain the ability to fully transform, a potion known for being highly difficult, complex and time-consuming, showing her very impressive talent in the art of potion-making.
Transfiguration: She was also a mistress of transfiguration, being able to turn herself into a sea bird at will. Given how Human Transfiguration is an incredibly complex and even dangerous branch of transfiguration, this was a remarkable magical feat.


== Behind the scenes ==
In Irish mythology, Cliodna was a goddess of love and beauty, said to have three brightly coloured birds whose song healed the sick. She left Tir Tairngire to be with her mortal lover, Ciabh√°n, but drowned as she slept in Glandore harbour in County Cork.
She was also rumoured to be the "Queen of the Banshees".
