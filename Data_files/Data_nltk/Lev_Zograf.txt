== Behind the scenes ==
This character is known only by his surname in the books. His first name is given as "Lev" on a Famous Wizard Card in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.


== Etymology ==
The name "Lev" is an antiquated word for "lion" in Bulgarian, now only retained as the name of Bulgaria's main currency unit. It also means "lion" in Russian, functioning as a vernacular form of Leo. This was the real Russian name of both author Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910) and revolutionary Leon Trotsky (1879-1940). In Hebrew the name means "heart".
Lev Yashin (1929 - 1990) is a Russian goalkeeper widely believed to have been the best goalkeeper in the history of football. The Lev Yashin Award is awarded to the best goalkeeper in each World Cup.
A zograf is a person who paints churches (from Greek "zografos"). Several Bulgarians in this walk of life were given this nickname-turned-surname in recognition to their work.
