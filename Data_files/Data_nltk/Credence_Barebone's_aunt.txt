This woman was an aunt of Credence Barebone.


== Biography ==
This woman was caring for her nephew Credence in 1901. At some point during a ship voyage to America in 1901, the ship she and Credence went on sank during a storm. Unbeknownst to her, her nephew was switched in the crib with another baby by a young Leta Lestrange. The life boat she went on capsized and she drowned when she dived under the water to try to save baby Corvus, whom she believed was her nephew.
Credence survived and ended up being raised by an unrelated woman in New York, known as Mary Lou Barebone, who treated Credence abusively.


== Physical description ==
The aunt of Credence Barebone was described being a dark-haired young woman. She wears a nightdress and life jacket minutes prior before her death.


== Personality ==
Judging by her actions, the aunt was shown to have taken her responsibility as her nephew's caretaker very serious to the point that she willingly risk her own life to save the child she believed to be him.


== Behind the scenes ==
She is played by Linda Santiago in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.
The Dumbledore siblings, Albus, Aberforth and Ariana, are known to have had a maiden aunt, Honoria; if Credence is indeed their brother, it is possible this individual could be her.
It is only shown in the credits and in the The Crimes of Grindelwald screenplay that she is Credence's aunt. It is never stated whether Leta revealed this to Newt Scamander and Tina Goldstein, so it is possible the latter are unaware of that fact by the end of that film.
