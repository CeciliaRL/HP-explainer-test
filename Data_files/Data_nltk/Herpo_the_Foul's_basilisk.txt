Herpo the Foul's basilisk was the first recorded basilisk in history. It was bred by Herpo the Foul, an Ancient Greek Dark Wizard, who discovered after much experimentation that a chicken egg hatched beneath a toad would produce this gigantic serpent. Herpo was able to control the basilisk as he was able to speak Parseltongue. It is said that this particular basilisk lived to be almost 900 years old.


== Behind the scenes ==
Ironically, Herpo the Foul was also responsible for creating the first Horcrux which are known to be vulnerable to Basilisk venom. It is unknown if there is any further connection.
