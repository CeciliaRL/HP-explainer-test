== Biography ==
Mary Cattermole said that Maisie and her siblings were frightened by their mother's interrogation by the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. They believed that she would not return home.
Her mother told the Ministry that Maisie and her brother and sister were at home. They were probably not attending Hogwarts yet, because Harry Potter told her and her husband to pick up the children and run away.
