Mrs Plunkett was a woman who lived during the 19th century.
She had at least one child, a witch daughter, Mirabella. During a holiday to Loch Lomond, her daughter fell in love with a merman, and wished to marry him. However, Mrs Plunkett and her husband were deeply opposed, and forbade Mirabella to marry her merman lover. Mirabella transformed herself into a haddock and was never seen again.
