A goblin philosopher once noted on the importance of money, considering it the source of all happiness.


== Behind the scenes ==
This quote is a variant of 1 Timothy 6:10, which states: "For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows." The change of "evil" to "happiness" reflects goblin ideals over human ones.
