== Biography ==
During the trial of Mrs Hall for the 14 September 1926 murders of Rev. Mr Hall and Mrs Mills, a Mrs Gibson claimed to have seen Mrs Hall with a male companion, presumed to have been her accomplice, in De Russey Lane on the night in question. She stated that she was able to see their faces thanks to the light of a passing car. George Sipel was subpoenaed to confirm Mrs Gibson's report that he was the one behind the wheel of the vehicle. Mrs Gibson claimed that she heard that Sipel had told his friend, John Garry, that he had seen her that night. Sipel denied this claim and reportedly showed a "frantic eagerness" to avoid testifying. The trial was reported on in the 6 December 1926 issue of the New York Chronicle.


== Behind the scenes ==
The text of the article mentioning John Garry in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was taken from the real 21 November 1922 issue of The Evening World. This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in 1926, but the actual events referenced occurred in 1922.
