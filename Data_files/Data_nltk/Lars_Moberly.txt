In 1926, the Magical Congress of the United States of America issued a wanted poster for Moberly, which stated he was wanted for No-Maj murder. It described him as a "malicious killer" and "bearing wand, most menacing and extremely dangerous." A reward of 3000 dragots was offered for information leading to his capture. The poster was hanging in The Blind Pig when Newt Scamander paid it a visit in December 1926.
