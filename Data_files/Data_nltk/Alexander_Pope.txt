Alexander Pope (21 May, 1688â€”30 May, 1744) was a Muggle poet, best known for his satirical verse and for his translation of Homer.
Albus Dumbledore was well read with Pope's work, quoting him ("hope springs eternal") on his analysis of the popular wizarding tale The Tale of the Three Brothers, by Beedle the Bard.
