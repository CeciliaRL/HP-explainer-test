Marcus Minucius was a wizard who presumably owned and/or founded the Diagon Alley shop Marcus Minucius Myomancer.


== Etymology ==
In Roman naming conventions, "Marcus" was a common Latin praenomen (personal name) used by the gens Minucia; the name survived the Roman Empire and has continued to be used in modern-days, in various forms.
"Minucius" was the nomen (designated name, signifying to be a member of a specific gens) representing the gens Minucia.


== Behind the scenes ==
Illustrator Jim Kay picked "Marcus Minucius" because of the Roman consul Marcus Minucius Rufus and his political enemy.
In the real-world, as Marcus was a popular praenomen, historically, there are a number of individuals with names using the combination "Marcus Minucius", such as Marcus Minucius Felix and Marcus Minucius Augurinus, amongst others.
In those cases, Minucius representing gens Minucia, was an ancient Roman family.
