Kay Hurwitz (born c. 1920) was a British Muggle violist. She was married to violinist Emanuel Hurwitz until his death in 2006.
On Sunday, 7 May in a year prior to 1997, at 7:30 in the evening, Kay and her husband gave a performance of Mozart's Sinfonia Concertanti at St. Mary's Church Hall, which was directed by Alec Webb. The couple were accompanied by the Dollis Chamber Ensemble for the first time. Hermione Granger had a poster for this concert stuck up on the bulletin board in her bedroom in the Granger family's house.

In real life, Emanuel and Kay Hurwitz are, respectively, the stepgrandfather and grandmother of Miraphora Mina, a graphic artist who worked on all eight Harry Potter films. Mina likely created the prop concert poster featured in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 as a tribute to them.
