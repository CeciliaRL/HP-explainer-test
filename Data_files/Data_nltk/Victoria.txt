Victoria (full name Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 â€“ 22 January 1901) was a Muggle who reigned as Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 1837 to 1901.
Evangeline Orpington, the Minister for Magic from 1849 to 1855, was a close friend of Queen Victoria. The queen never suspected that Orpington was a witch.
Victoria was buried on 4 February 1901. The Minister for Magic at the time, Faris Spavin, attended her funeral in an admiral's hat and spats. This was the final act that made the Wizengamot suggest that Spavin, then 147 years old, retire.
A portrait of Victoria hung in the abandoned old bell tower near the pitch where the Chudley Cannons practised.
Victoria was a descendant of King William I and a great-great-grandmother of Queen Elizabeth II.
