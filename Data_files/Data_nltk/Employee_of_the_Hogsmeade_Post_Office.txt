This witch or wizard was employed by the Hogsmeade Post Office in Hogsmeade village sometime prior to 1994; in the spring of that year, Harry Potter snuck into the village using the Marauder's Map and the Cloak of Invisibility, while this individual helped his friend Ron to check on the price to send an owl to his brother Bill in Egypt, giving Harry time to look around.
