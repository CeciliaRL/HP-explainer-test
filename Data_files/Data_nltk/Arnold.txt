Arnold was Ginny Weasley's purple Pygmy Puff, or miniature Puffskein.


== Biography ==
Arnold was purchased from Ginny's brothers Fred and George Weasley at their shop in August of 1996. Arnold was transported in a cage during the car ride from The Burrow to King's Cross Station on 1 September 1996.
In the Gryffindor common room in Hogwarts he was seen playing with Ginny or riding her shoulder. It is likely that he was taken with the Weasleys when the family went into hiding in the spring of 1998.


== Etymology ==
Ginny's father, Arthur Weasley, was mistakenly called "Arnold Weasley" in a 1994 Daily Prophet article written by Rita Skeeter. "Arnold" is also an anagram of "Ronald", a possible reference to Ginny's older brother.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the novel he is purple, but in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, he is pink.
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 Ginny has Arnold already in 1995 and the player can use him in the levels.
According to the Hogwarts supply list, students are allowed to take an owl, a cat, or a toad to Hogwarts. However, it seems that Ginny was allowed to take her pygmy puff like her brother was able to bring his rat.
