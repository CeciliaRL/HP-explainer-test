 	 	 	 		 			 		 		 		 			Hedwig gets hit and killed with the Killing curse 		 	 
This Death Eater shot out a Killing Curse that killed Harry Potter's pet owl, Hedwig. It is likely the curse that killed Hedwig was intended for Rubeus Hagrid or Harry Potter. He or she most likely took part in the Battle of Hogwarts. It is also likely that, after Lord Voldemort's defeat in 1998, this Death Eater was either killed or imprisoned in Azkaban for their crimes as a Death Eater.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Dark Arts: This Death Eater was highly accomplished with dark magic, as they were able to successfully cast the Killing Curse, one of the Unforgivable Curses which required both willpower and magical skill to perform.
Flying: This Death Eater was an accomplished broomstick flyer, as they took part in the Battle of the Seven Potters on a broom.


== Behind the scenes ==
Hedwig's killer is not explicitly identified, so he/she may have appeared in other books, films or video games, but the only known appearance is Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.
According to the films, Hedwig's killer might have been Selwyn, who was known to be pursuing Harry and Hagrid at the time since Hedwig's death in the film happened quite a while into the fight when there was only a couple death eaters following them, or it might have been Stanley Shunpike under the Imperius Curse.
Although Hedwig appeared to have been unintentionally struck by a stray Killing Curse meant for Harry or Hagrid in the book, Hedwig's killer in the film adaptation is shown to deliberately aim the curse at Hedwig after she flew in their way.
