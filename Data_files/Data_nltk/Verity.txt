Verity (fl. 1996) was a British witch and shop assistant that worked for Fred and George Weasley in Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.


== Biography ==
She seemed to follow a chain of command; in the 1996 summer holidays, Harry Potter overheard her use the formal title "Mister" to address Fred and George. When Fred and George went into hiding and closed the shop in Diagon Alley, it is also possible she went into hiding if she was not already in hiding.
