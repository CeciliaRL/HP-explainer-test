== Biography ==
They had apparently been teaching at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for a long time, as Budge described this Professor as "ancient".
When needing wild, uncontrollable laughter for his Laughing Potion, Budge often thought of an incident where a rival student of his spilled Love Potion onto himself, thus becoming attracted to this Professor. In Budge's opinion, this was the most humorous occurrence he had ever witnessed.
By the age of fourteen, Budge was able to correct this Professor on the proper usage of Mackled Malaclaw tails in Potion-making.
