Rawya Zaghloul was an Egyptian witch who played as Seeker for the Egyptian National Quidditch team.


== Biography ==
She played in the 2002 Quidditch World Cup where she famously beat Bulgarian Seeker Viktor Krum to the Snitch, leading to the Bulgarian National Quidditch team's defeat. This was a "crushing disappointment" for Bulgaria and, coupled with the team's loss of the 1994 Quidditch World Cup final, it led to Viktor Krum's retirement.
