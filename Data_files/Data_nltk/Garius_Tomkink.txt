Professor Garius Tomkink was a magical historian and author.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the console versions of the Chamber of Secrets video game, Chroniculus Punnet stated to be the author of Hogwarts, A History. However, a later film prop identifies the book's author as Professor Garius Tomkink. Neither can be considered canon, however, as both the books and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter state that Bathilda Bagshot wrote it.
