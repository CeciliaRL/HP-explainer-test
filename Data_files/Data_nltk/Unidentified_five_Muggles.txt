This family of five muggles lived in the town of Gaddley.


== Biography ==
They were murdered by Death Eaters or their supporters in early 1998, presumably for amusement or sport. Muggle authorities wrongly attributed the deaths to a gas leak. Their deaths were reported on Potterwatch in March of 1998, with Order of the Phoenix members informing the broadcaster Lee Jordan their deaths were in fact caused by the Killing Curse.
