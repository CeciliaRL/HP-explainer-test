Merton Graves (b. 1978) was a wizard and the cellist for the popular wizarding band The Weird Sisters.


== Behind the scenes ==
If he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he would have been in school from around 1989 to 1996, making him a third year during Harry Potter's first year there, and a sixth year during the Triwizard Tournament, when the Weird Sisters performed at Hogwarts for the Yule Ball.
Merton Graves and Herman Wintringham were absent from the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and did not play with the Weird Sisters.
It's possible he is a relative of the Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them character Percival Graves.

The name "Merton" is from a surname which was derived from a place name meaning "town on a lake" in Old English.
