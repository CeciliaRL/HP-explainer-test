James Killick was a wizard reported missing along with his relative, Katie, on the Potterwatch radio programme in 1997. His disappearance was most likely linked to a Death Eater attack.


== Etymology ==
The name "James" is the English form of the Late Latin name Iacomus which was derived from Ιακωβος (Iakobos), the New Testament Greek form of the Hebrew name Ya'aqov.


== Behind the scenes ==
This character is presumably a tribute to a relative of Rob Killick, who worked as a sound mix technician on Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, and as a dialogue editor on Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
