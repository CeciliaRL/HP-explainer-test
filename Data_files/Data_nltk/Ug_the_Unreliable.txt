Ug the Unreliable (fl. 17th century) was an infamous goblin con artist, who became notable for organising the Demiguise Derby and absconded with the profits. For orchestrating this famous fraud, he was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card.
At some point in his life he peddled Leprechaun gold, which led to him being tracked down, and then imprisoned by wizards. His imprisonment provoked one of the Goblin Rebellions of the seventeenth or eighteenth centuries.
