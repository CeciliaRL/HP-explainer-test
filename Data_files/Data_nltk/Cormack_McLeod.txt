Cormack McLeod was the manager of the Quidditch team, the Montrose Magpies. He fired one of the team's Chasers, Alasdair Maddock, prior to a match against the Caerphilly Catapults because he had been caught playing a Muggle sport involving the use of "peculiar metal sticks" to knock "non-flying balls into holes in the ground." Maddock had previously upset Quidditch matches by trying out football and basketball tactics.
