Argo Pyrites was a wizard, alchemist and the author of Alchemy, Ancient Art and Science.


== Etymology ==
The name Argo derives from the Greek word argos, meaning “swift”. 
In Greek mythology, Argo was the ship on which Jason and his companions, the Argonauts, sailed on their journey to find the Golden Fleece. Pyrite is a shiny yellow mineral, which is also called Fool's Gold, due to its resemblance to the precious metal.


== Behind the scenes ==
This character is mentioned only on a page from an early draft of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone which J. K. Rowling posted on her website. He may have been related to Pyrites, a Death Eater who was included in early drafts of the same book, but was also discarded.
It is also possible that the Death Eater in question was supposed to be Argo Pyrites, and that the two are one and the same.
