Professor Marazion succeeded Minerva McGonagall in the post of Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This individual became Headmaster or Headmistress some time between 2008 and 2017 after Minerva McGonagall went into retirement as she was "getting on a bit".


== Behind the scenes ==
Although J. K. Rowling initially said in interviews that McGonagall was "getting on a bit" and that Hogwarts had a new Headmaster by the time of the Epilogue in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (set in 2017), this was later retconned in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which has McGonagall in office as late as 2020.
Jack Thorne's original draft of the Harry Potter and the Cursed Child script featured this individual, and first named him as "Professor Marazion". Rowling herself vetoed this character by saying "I think Marazion doesn't fit. I think we need Professor McGonagall."
