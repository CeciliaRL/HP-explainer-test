== Biography ==
Former French prime minister Georges Clemenceau came to the United States to deliver a talk on 6 December 1926. He hid himself away on the upper floor of  Gibson's home on East 73rd Street in Manhattan to prepare his speech for that evening. Many admirers flocked to the house, hoping to secure interviews or autographs, but only a reporter for the New York Chronicle was granted access. 


== Behind the scenes ==
The text of the article mentioning Charles Dana Gibson in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was taken from the real 21 November 1922 issue of The Evening World. This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in 1926, but the actual historical event referenced happened in 1922.
