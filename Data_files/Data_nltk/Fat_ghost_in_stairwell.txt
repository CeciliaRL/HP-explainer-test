This fat ghost appeared in a stairwell at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry likely sometime during the 1994â€“1995 school year.


== Behind the scenes ==
This ghost's identity has been an ongoing matter of discussion for the Harry Potter community.
He may be Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington as he wears a ruff and looks like he was of aristocratic status before his death.
He may also looks similar to the Fat Friar, being round and jolly, but the Fat Friar wears a monk's robe, and is a monk rather than a lord.
Given his appearance, he may be the portly ghost that attended Sir Nick's Death Day Party  on 31 October 1992.
He may be another unspecified ghost from the series or simply invented by the illustrator Giles Greenfield for decorative purposes.
In earlier sketches done by illustrator for this scene, there was originally no ghost present, but he was added subsequently in more finished sketches, although his depiction trended towards even more portly.
