The second pet snake of Morfin Gaunt was the replacement of another late snake. The snake was an Adder.


== History ==
When Bob Ogden came to visit the Gaunt Shack, Morfin was twisting it in his fingers, singing to it in Parseltongue:
"Hissy, hissy, little snakey
slither on the floor,
you be good to Morfin,
or he'll nail you to the door."
The snake's final fate is unknown, but the day it heard the song was the same day Morfin was placed under arrest by the Wizard police, along with his father. It was evident that the arrest was beneficial for the snake, as it was spared the gruesome, inhumane fate of being nailed.
