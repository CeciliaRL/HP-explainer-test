This waiter served food and drinks at the Slug Club Christmas party in 1996 along with Neville Longbottom and another waiter. He was seen passing by when Horace Slughorn and Harry Potter were having their picture taken. He offered dragon tartare to Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. Both passed, and the waiter told them this choice was for the better, as the hors d'oeuvre gave one "terribly bad breath." However, upon hearing this, Hermione took the entire plate, hoping to repel the unwelcome attentions of her date, Cormac McLaggen. He was later seen decorating a plate of food.
