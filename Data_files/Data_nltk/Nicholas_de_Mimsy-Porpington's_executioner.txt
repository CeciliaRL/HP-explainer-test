This individual (fl. 1492) was the man in charge of Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's execution in 1492, after the wizard made a tusk sprout out of a noble lady. The man appeared to be familiar with the wizard, as he called him "Nick". The execution went wrong, however, as someone misplaced the rock where they usually sharpened the axe. The executioner took forty-five hacks until he killed Sir Nicholas, and in between whacks and thwacks, he reassured Sir Nicholas that it "won't be too long".


== Behind the scenes ==
This individual is only mentioned on a self-penned ballad relaying the story of Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's death, that was supposed to make an appearance in the earlier drafts of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.
