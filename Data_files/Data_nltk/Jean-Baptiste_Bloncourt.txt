== Biography ==
In the first hour of the match, Bloncourt mis-hit a ferocious Bludger, sending it hurtling toward his own teammate, Keeper Lenelle Paraison. Paraison was left with a broken nose. Four hours into the match, the Haitian Seeker Sylvian Jolicoeur came within inches of capturing the Snitch and securing the win, but another of Bloncourt's misaimed Bludgers knocked him out cold. To make matters worse, the Snitch proceeded to get caught up in Bloncourt's sleeve, who incurred in Snitchnip when he wrestled it out of his undergarments and grabbed it. The team was immediately disqualified. Following the match, Bloncourt was reported to be hiding in an undisclosed location.
