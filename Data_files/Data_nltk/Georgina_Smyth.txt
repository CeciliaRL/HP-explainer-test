Georgina Smyth was a English witch who lived in Nettlebed, Oxfordshire. 
She wrote a letter to the wireless programme Toots, Shoots 'n' Roots asking how to treat a Flitterbloom that she had not watered in months. The Flitterbloom was needed for a potion that Smyth planned to brew, but, even after she threatened the plant with curses, it would not revive.
