Elsie Prod was a witch who lived in Didsbury, England in late 1992 and was the wife of Demetrius Prod.


== Biography ==
Sometime prior to January 1992, her husband wrote to Kwikspell Company, and a month thereafter managed to turn Elsie into a yak; he wrote an advertisement for the Kwikspell Company, proud of this feat. Harry Potter and Argus Filch would later read about this.
On the eve of 27 November, 1998 after supper, Demetrius and Elsie got into an argument over the washing-up. He died that night, described by the Daily Prophet to have been "noisily". His obituary claimed Elise "sadly missed" her husband, despite seemingly not getting along well with him.
