== Biography ==
Many considered this teacher to be useless. Charles Weasley talked about this to his older brother William Weasley, who had graduated Hogwarts the previous year and had now been working at Gringotts as Curse-Breaker. As such, Bill had asked Albus Dumbledore permission to use Classroom 3C for tutoring students after daily classes were done.
By the end of the year, this professor needed to be replaced because of Lord Voldemort's jinx on the post.
