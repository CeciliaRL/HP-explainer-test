Kquewanda Bailey was a Jamaican witch who played as the Keeper for the 2014 Jamaican National Quidditch team.


== Biography ==
During the fourth match of the 427th Quidditch World Cup, USA versus Jamaica, Bailey unexpectedly toppled unconscious from her broomstick, just moments before US Chaser Quentin Kowalski scored a goal and US Seeker Darius Smackhammer caught the Snitch, resulting in a narrow victory for the United States. The convenient timing of Bailey's unconsciousness aroused suspicion of foul play, but the ICWQC later confirmed that Bailey was suffering from an infected Sasabonsam bite, sustained during the disastrous World Cup opening ceremony.
