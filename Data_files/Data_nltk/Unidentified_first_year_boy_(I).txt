This wizard was a student who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during Jacob's sibling's time at school.


== Biography ==

He was born somewhere in Great Britain or Ireland during the early 1970s. He began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1985â€“1986 school year.
In his first year, he spotted Skye Parkin and Jacob's sibling in the common room of his house. Skye told the boy to leave and tell no one, which he agreed to do when Skye promised him an autograph from her father.


== Behind the scenes ==
Which house he is in depends on that of Jacob's sibling (chosen by the player). If Jacob's sibling is in Gryffindor, Hufflepuff or Slytherin, this boy is in Ravenclaw. If Jacob's sibling is in Ravenclaw, he is in Slytherin.
He is a fan of the Quidditch team Wigtown Wanderers.
It is possible that he is Teddy Taylor.
