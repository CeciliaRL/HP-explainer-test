Crapaud is a character in the 15th century play Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré Les Pieds by the French writer, Malecrit.
In the play, Crapaud asks Grenouille for help to carry a cow to the market, but Grenouille has to refuse since he is due to play Keeper for his local Quidditch team. The play's main conflict occurs when Crapaud performs the titular foot-transfiguration, an act traditionally accompanied by a puff of yellow smoke (which is conjured by a special effects wizard concealed beneath the stage).
The play concludes with Crapaud's final rousing monologue.
