This individual (fl. 1866â€”1883) was a "irritable-looking" wizard who worked for the Department of Magical Games and Sports in Ministry of Magic in the 1880s.
On the night of 11 February, 1883, this wizard represented the Department of Magical Games and Sports during a news conference over which he was asked to comment on the replacement of the "scoring baskets" used for centuries for goal scoring in Quidditch with fixed, standardised hoops on poles. This wizard noted on the unfairness that having baskets (which the Ministry found impossible to regulate and standardise) to score goals led to, but at that point he was forced to retreat under a hail of baskets thrown by the angry demonstrators assembled in the hall.
This Departmental representative also seemed to have been the one to announce the introduction of the Stooging Penalty on the evening of 21 June, one year later. As the "harassed-looking" wizard went on about how the Ministry move would eliminate the severe Keeper injuries there had been occurring too often, and how everything would be "much cleaner and fairer", he was again forced to retreat as the angry crowd started to bombard him with Quaffles.
