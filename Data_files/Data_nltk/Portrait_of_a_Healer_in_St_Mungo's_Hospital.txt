This portrait of a Healer was hanging in the fourth floor in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries.


== Biography ==
He diagnosed Ron Weasley with Spattergroit during a visit to the hospital at Christmas in December 1995, given the "unsightly blemishes" on his skin that would leave him uglier than he already was. The portrait suggested that Ron "take the liver of a toad, bind it tight about his throat and stand naked by the full moon in a barrel of eels' eyes" as a cure. Ron took this diagnosis as a great offence, and countered that they were only freckles.
