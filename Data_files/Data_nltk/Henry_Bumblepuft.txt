Henry Bumblepuft (b. 1493) was a wizard whose portrait hung at the ground-floor landing of the Grand Staircase in Hogwarts Castle. This portrait was painted when he was forty-nine years old.


== Etymology ==
"Henry" is from the Germanic name Heimirich, which means "home ruler", composed of the elements heim, "home" and ric, "power", "ruler". It was later commonly spelled Heinrich, with the spelling altered due to the influence of other Germanic names, like Haganrich, in which the first element is hagan, "enclosure".


== Behind the scenes ==

This portrait was commissioned specifically for the Harry Potter films, his face being inspired on the likeness of Stuart Craig, production designer for all the eight Harry Potter films.
The painting was based on William Hogarth's 1745 self-portrait work The Painter and His Pug.
