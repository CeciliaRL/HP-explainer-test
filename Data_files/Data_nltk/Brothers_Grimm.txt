Jacob Grimm (1785–1863) and Wilhelm Grimm (1786–1859), commonly referred to collectively as the Brothers Grimm, were German philologists and cultural historians who specialised in folklore.


== History ==
In 1812, they published Children's and Household Tales, a collection of German fairy tales they had gathered. Among the stories it contained were "Cinderella" and "Snow White and the Seven Dwarves". These became favourites of Muggle children but remained relatively unknown among wizarding families. However, the Hogwarts library kept at least one copy of Household Stories, an English translation of the tales by Lucy Crane.
