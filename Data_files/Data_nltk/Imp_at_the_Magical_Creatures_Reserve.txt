This Imp lived in the Magical Creatures Reserve in the late 1980s.


== Biography ==
During one of Nymphadora Tonks's visits to the Zonko's Joke Shop in the 1986â€“1987 school year, this Imp crashed into her, making her fall and trigger all the Dungbombs. Knowing Tonks's clumsy and mischievous nature, the shop's owner, Bilton Bilmes, banned her for good from Zonko's.
Knowing it was actually the Imp's fault, Tonks, Jacob's sibling and Rubeus Hagrid went searching for him in the Three Broomsticks Inn, in which he was giving Madam Rosmerta a lot of trouble. Jacob's sibling hit him with the Knockback Jinx and Hagrid brought him back to his garden. They tried to convince him to go with them and prove Tonks's innocence, but he wouldn't cooperate.
They then tried to "put him in his place" by taking him to see Mr Filch, but after some unfriendly interaction with Mrs Norris, the Imp disappeared in his office. After he was found, he was brought to the Training Grounds and witnessed Jacob's sibling and Tonks curse each other with the Jelly-Legs Curse. The Imp finally trusted them enough, and so agreed to revisit Zonko's to clear Tonks's name.
He tripped Bilton and let him set off the Dungbombs himself, and while this proved Tonks's innocence, Bilton banned all Imps instead. He was later convinced to lift this ban by Jacob's sibling.
