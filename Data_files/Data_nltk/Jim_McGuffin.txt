Jim McGuffin was a Muggle television weatherman in 1981, working alongside Ted. McGuffin had predicted rain for November 1st, but due to the downfall of Lord Voldemort and celebrations by the Wizarding community, his forecasted rain became shooting stars across some areas of Great Britain. Obviously unaware of the true reason, McGuffin wondered on air if people had been celebrating Bonfire Night early. Vernon Dursley watched the broadcast, prompting him to ask his wife, Petunia, if the peculiar weather had anything to do with her sister's "people."


== Behind the scenes ==
In fiction, a MacGuffin (sometimes McGuffin or maguffin) is a plot device in the form of some goal, desired object, or other motivator that the protagonist pursues, often with little or no narrative explanation. The specific nature of a MacGuffin is typically unimportant to the overall plot. The most common type of MacGuffin is a person, place, or thing (such as money or an object of value). Other more abstract types include victory, glory, survival, power, love, or some unexplained driving force.
