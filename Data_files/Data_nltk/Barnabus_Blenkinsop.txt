Barnabus Blenkinsop (d. February, 1999) was a wizard. His death was announced in the Daily Prophet. His obituary offered a reward for information about what happened to him, since all that was found in his bed in St Mungo's was a can of anchovies.


== Behind the scenes ==
While the fate that befell Blenkinsop is ultimately unknown, the Ministry of Magic eventually solved the mystery of his disappearance, as prior to the London Five incident in 2015, no one in Great Britain had disappeared without a trace since the 'Dark Times'.
