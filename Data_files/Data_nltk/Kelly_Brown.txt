Kelly Brown (b. 8 June, 1982) is a professional rugby union player who plays as a flanker, and has captained the Scottish rugby team since 2012. He may be related to the wizarding Brown family, possibly having Lavender Brown for a cousin.
In 2014, Kelly Brown, along with Jim Hamilton and Stuart Hogg, came under suspect, among wizarding circles, of actually being a talented Squib. While there is no wizarding rule which prevents a squib from actually playing on a muggle team, the act of smuggling a squib into the team, which is the rumoured mission of the WSSRU, is in violation of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy which prohibits wizards from participating in muggle sport.
