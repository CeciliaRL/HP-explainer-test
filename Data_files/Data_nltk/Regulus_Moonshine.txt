Professor Regulus Moonshine was a wizard who developed a potion to suppress hags' normal appetite for human flesh. He lost several chunks of own body while conducting the clinical trials.
An article in the Daily Prophet called him "Professor", but it is not known if he ever taught at a wizarding school, like Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
