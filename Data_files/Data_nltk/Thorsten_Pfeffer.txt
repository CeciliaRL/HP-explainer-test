Thorsten Pfeffer was a German wizard who played as the Seeker for the 2014 German National Quidditch team.


== Biography ==
During their match against Wales, he attempted the life-threatening Wronski Feint. However, he failed to pull out in time and collided with the ground at what onlookers estimated to be sixty miles an hour. Healers immediately flooded the Pitch and administered Skele-Gro. According to the team manager Franziska Faust, Pfeffer was likely to make a complete recovery, though he had broken most of his bones and believed himself to be a budgerigar called Klaus.
