This violet-cloaked wizard was an old man Vernon Dursley ran into in November 1981. Upon being knocked over by the latter, he stood back up and, told Vernon no apology was necessary as nothing could upset him that day and walked off, but not before giving Dursley a hug around the middle. He, among many other wizards, was in gleeful spirits that day as Lord Voldemort had been nearly vanquished (although everyone believed he was completely gone) thanks to the baby Harry Potter.


== Behind the scenes ==
Given the similarity in their descriptions, it is possible that this individual is Filius Flitwick. Even though this scene takes place during the Hogwarts school year, two other Hogwarts professors and one other staff member were known to be outside the school that day as well.
It is also possible that this man is Dedalus Diggle, who is described in some similar ways as well.
