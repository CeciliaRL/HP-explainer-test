This individual was a wizard who attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup between Bulgaria and Ireland. He claimed that he was a Vampire Hunter in an attempt to impress a group of Veela, after refuting the claims of his friend who said he was a dragon killer.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is extremely unlikely that the "vampire hunter"'s claim was true given that killing vampires is illegal under the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans (paragraph twelve). However, very dangerous vampires were killed at times, as shown in the case of Herbert Varney


== Appearances ==
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First appearance)
