Gideon Crumb (b. 1975) was the wizard who played bagpipes for the popular wizarding band The Weird Sisters.


== Biography ==
On 25 December 1994, Crumb and his fellow bandmates played during the Yule Ball at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, in the Yule Ball. They played songs such as Do the Hippogriff.


== Etymology ==
The name "Gideon" means "feller" or "hewer" in Hebrew. Gideon was a hero of the Old Testament who led the Israelites against the Midianites. In the English-speaking world, Gideon has been used as a given name since the Protestant Reformation, and it was popular among the Puritans.


== Behind the scenes ==
Steven Claydon played Gideon Crumb in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. In the film, he plays a keyboard in addition to bagpipes.
If Gideon attended Hogwarts, then he would have graduated a mere year or less before he played at the Yule Ball; he would have started at Hogwarts in September 1986 or 1987, and thus would have finished in June 1993 or 1994.
