Minister Joshua Sankara was a Burkinabé wizard who played as Seeker for the Burkinabé National Quidditch team during the 2006 Quidditch World Cup. When the team won the World Cup, Sankara was promptly named Minister for Magic, although he resigned two days later since he would much rather play Quidditch than hold office at the Burkinabé Ministry of Magic.
