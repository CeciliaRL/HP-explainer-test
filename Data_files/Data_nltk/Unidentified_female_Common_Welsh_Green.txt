This unidentified Common Welsh Green was the female dragon that Fleur Delacour had to get past in the First Task of the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. Fleur attempted to put her into a bewitched sleep but was only partly successful. Fleur escaped with the tournament's golden egg but the dragon caught Fleur's skirt and set it on fire during the task.
