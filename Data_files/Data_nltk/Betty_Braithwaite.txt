Betty Braithwaite was a witch who worked as a reporter for the Daily Prophet.
In 1997, she got an exclusive interview with Rita Skeeter about her then-upcoming book, The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. She was invited into Rita's home, where Rita served her tea and a slice of pound cake.


== Behind the scenes ==
Braithwaite apparently took a liking to Rita Skeeter, or at least pretended to, as her article gave the impression of Skeeter being a sweet, kind woman, despite her cruel and libellous writings. However, this could have been due to an entirely understandable desire not to get on the wrong side of someone with such a poison pen, and a clear capacity to carry a grudge.
