Bob Hitchens was a Muggle who married the pure-blood witch Iola Black, the youngest sister of famous Phineas Nigellus Black. Their marriage caused her to be struck off the Black family tree tapestry.


== Behind the scenes ==
It was not clear at first whether Hitchens was a Muggle or a Muggle-born wizard. Although the partial family tree on the Harry Potter Lexicon lists him as a Muggle, it does the same for Muggle-born wizard Ted Tonks, possibly indicating that the Blacks did not draw a distinction between Muggles and Muggle-borns. However, in the partial tree written by J. K. Rowling given in the Harry Potter Film Wizardry, Ted Tonks is listed as a Muggle-born and Hitchens as a Muggle.
