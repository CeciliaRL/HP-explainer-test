Alastair was a spider who lived in the cupboard under the stairs at 4 Privet Drive. He was named by Harry Potter who, neglected by his aunt and uncle, would speak to him frequently and considered him a friend.


== Behind the scenes ==

This character was created for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by Steve Kloves, but was ultimately cut.
It is known that some magical spiders, like Acromantulas, are sentient and can communicate with humans. It is therefore possible that Alastair was genuinely able to converse with Harry, unbeknownst to the Dursleys.
