This goblin was given the unenviable task of informing Lord Voldemort that a break-in had occurred at Gringotts Wizarding Bank, his current place of occupation, and that an item had been stolen from the Lestrange Vault, in May 1998.

 	 	 	 		 		 		 			The goblin is killed, along with all others that came to bring Voldemort the bad news 		 	 
When Voldemort demanded to know what had been taken, the goblin hesitantly replied that the stolen object was a small golden cup. Enraged at the loss of one of his Horcruxes, Voldemort immediately killed the goblin with the Killing Curse, as well as several wizards present at the time.
Voldemort kicked the goblin's corpse aside as he paced the room and planned his next move.
