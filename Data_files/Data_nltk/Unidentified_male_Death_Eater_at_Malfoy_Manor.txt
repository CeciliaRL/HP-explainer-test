== Biography ==
He was one of the many Death Eaters present at the meeting in Malfoy Manor. He was sitting in front of Amycus Carrow during the meeting. When Lord Voldemort asked one of his followers to hand over their wand, he remained silent in the deeply terrifying and malevolent presence of his Dark Lord.
This Death Eater may have taken part in the Battle of Hogwarts on the 2 May, 1998. He was presumably killed, sent to Azkaban, or forced to go on the run following his master's defeat at the hands of Harry Potter.
