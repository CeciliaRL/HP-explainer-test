The two children of Dudley Dursley and his wife were Muggles. They would occasionally be visited by their magical second cousins, the two sons and daughter of their father's cousin Harry Potter.
While the two of them played with James, Albus, and Lily, the children's fathers, Harry and Dudley, would sit silently together as they were on "Christmas Card" terms.


== Behind the scenes ==
Rowling once considered having Harry helping Dudley with a magical child of his own Platform 9 3/4 in the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but later changed her mind, stating that "any latent wizarding genes would never survive contact with Uncle Vernonâ€™s DNA."
It is possible that Dudley raised his children to be better than he was during his childhood, given that the encounter with the Dementors made him change his ways.
It should be noted that Harry's children get along well with Dudley's own, supporting this.
