Samson Wiblin (fl. 1430) was an English wizard who lived in England during the 15th century.


== Biography ==
He was the favourite to win the All-England Wizarding Duelling Competition of 1430, but was beaten by Alberta Toothill, who hit him with a Blasting Curse. It can be assumed that Samson was an excellent duellist as Ms Toothill was immortalised on a Chocolate Frog Card just for beating him.


== Etymology ==
The name "Samson" comes from the Hebrew name שִׁמְשׁוֹן (Shimshon) which probably meant "sun".
