Nugent Potts was a Quidditch referee in 1894. While refereeing a match involving the Appleby Arrows, he was pierced through the nose by an arrow fired from the wand of an Arrows supporter. This accident led the Department of Magical Games and Sports to ban Arrow supporters from firing arrows from their wands when the team scored.
