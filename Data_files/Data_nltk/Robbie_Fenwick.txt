Robbie Fenwick was a Muggle boy and a dental patient of Mr and Mrs Granger. During one appointment, he bit Mr Granger, giving him a wound that required ten stitches to close. Hermione Granger related this story to Horace Slughorn, a wizard unfamiliar with the Muggle world, when he asked if dentistry was a dangerous profession.
