Teffington (d. 1 May, 1998) was a wizard who served as a wizard guard of Gringotts Wizarding Bank in 1998 during the Death Eaters' reign over the wizarding world.


== Biography ==
He distrusted Hermione Granger (disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange) and Ronald Weasley (disguised as Dragomir Despard), as Griphook said, they knew Hermione was an imposter. He was standing in the entrance and stepped forward when Bellatrix denied to give her wand to Bogrod.
After the break-in, Teffington was summoned to Malfoy Manor, where he was killed by Lord Voldemort, in rage at having lost one of his Horcruxes, along with other guards and goblins.


== Behind the scenes ==
He is played by Anthony Allgood in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. He is unnamed in the film, but Bogrod refers to him as Teffington in the original screenplay.
He may be Marius's fellow guard, who was standing watch at the doors in the novel.
