== Biography ==
After inventing Gregory's Unctuous Unction, Gregory allegedly used the potion to worm his way into King Richard's confidence, earning him a fortune. He appeared on a silver Chocolate Frog Card for his legacy.
Gregory knew Erling the Great.
A secret passage out of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, found by Fred and George Weasley on their first week of school, is located behind a statue of Gregory the Smarmy. Early in the 1991-1992 school year, Lee Jordan discovered a secret passage that Fred and George suspected was probably this one.
A statue of Gregory the Smarmy is located on the first floor corridor.
A corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing was referred as "Gregory the Smarmyâ€™s corridor". Whether this is because it held a statue of him, or some other reason, was unclear. In early 1996, Fred and George set off a Portable Swamp there to serve as a distraction so Harry Potter could use Dolores Umbridge's fireplace to communicate with his godfather, Sirius Black.
