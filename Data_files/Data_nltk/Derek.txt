Derek (born c. 1982) was a student who began attending Hogwarts in 1993. During his first year, he stayed at school over the Christmas holidays, and was surprised when Albus Dumbledore asked him whether he had had any of the Chipolatas at the Christmas feast. He blushed deeply at being personally addressed by the Headmaster.
