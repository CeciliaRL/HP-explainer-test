== Biography ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Amrose Swott as a younger man 		 	 


=== Lifetime ===
Professor Swott lived in the early 18th century. He became the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at some point.


=== Post-mortem ===
Professor Swott died sometime in or prior to 1992. Two portraits of him hung at Hogwarts: one depicted a bespectacled young man, and another, painted in 1724 and hung in the Headmaster's office, depicted an older wizard with a long ginger beard. Swott's name was also carved into a wood panel on the wall of the school's Divination classroom.
In the winter of 1993, Swott's name appeared on the Marauder's Map, presumably indicating that he lingered at Hogwarts as a ghost after his death or that there is a student named after him.


== Etymology ==
"Ambrose" is a name, which ultimately derives from the Greek name Ambrosios, meaning "immortal". Swott may have been based on swot, a British slang term, meaning "to study hard" or "one who studies hard."


== Behind the scenes ==
Swott's portrait is inspired by a portrait of James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton.
The portrait depicting a younger Swott has been based on a 1685 self-portrait of Sir Godfrey Kneller (1646-1723).
The motto inscribed on Swott's portrait, Ora et Labora (meaning "Pray and Work") was the motto of the Benedictine monks.
