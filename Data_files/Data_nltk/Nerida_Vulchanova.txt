However according to  Pottermore, the school was founded by Nerida Vulchanova; a witch. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, at least one female is known to have attend Durmstrang during the 1994-1995 school year. Therefore, according to the books, the school is in fact co-ed, just like Hogwarts.
