John Bastedo (also known as Wolf) was an American wizarding criminal who operated in the 1920s.
In 1926, the Magical Congress of the United States of America issued a wanted poster for Bastedo, stating that he was wanted for "elf trafficking" and "No-Maj murder in Europe." A reward of 5,000 Dragots was offered for information leading to his capture. The wanted poster was hanging in The Blind Pig when Newt Scamander visited it in December 1926.
