This White-Haired Healer was a witch who attended the Battle of Hogwarts in May of 1998.


== Biography ==
Born somewhere in Europe, this witch was informed of the existence of magic and was trained as a witch.
On 2 May, 1998, she was called to Hogwarts Castle for the Battle of Hogwarts, and helped as a healer there. 


== Physical appearance ==
This witch had greyish white hair and fair skin; she wore the uniform of a healer. It can be noted that even when bending over a corpse, she managed to retain rather good posture.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
The witch, whoever she was, has a few skills:

Healing magic: She was called upon to act as a healer in the battle, and hence it is reasonable to assume that she was well-versed in this field of magic.
Defence Against the Dark Arts: She managed to survive at least half of the battle, and given that her opponents sought to kill, it is fair to say she was good in this field of magic as well.


== Behind the scenes ==
This woman's name is unknown.
She may be the wife of the man of the same-colour hair in the battle. Alternatively, she may be a teacher, member of staff, member of the Order of the Phoenix, or even a resident of Hogsmeade.
