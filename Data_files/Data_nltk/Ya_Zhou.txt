Madam Ya Zhou was a witch who was a delegate to the International Confederation of Wizards.


== Biography ==

On 6 December 1926, she met in New York to discuss the magical disturbances in New York, including the death of No-Maj Senator Henry Shaw Junior.


== Behind the scenes ==
Ya Zhou was portrayed by Gemma Chan in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
Based on her name, Ya Zhou was most likely from China and as such may have worked for the Chinese Ministry of Magic.
If "Ya" is indeed her surname, not "Zhou", then the name's pronunciation is the same as the word "Asia" in Chinese. In fact, the simplified Chinese translation of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: The Original Screenplay translates the name to "亚洲", which means Asia. But since "亚" is a very uncommon surname, the surname could be "周" ("Zhou") instead.
