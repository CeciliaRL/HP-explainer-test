Mr Hall (died 14 September 1926) was an American No-Maj Christian minister who lived during the early 20th century.
He was murdered on the night of 14 September 1926 along with a Mrs Mills. His wife, Mrs Hall, stood trial for the murders. A Mrs Gibson testified that she saw Mrs Hall on De Russey Lane with a male companion, presumed to be her accomplice, on the night of 14 September. The trial was reported on in the 6 December 1926 issue of the New York Chronicle.


== Behind the scenes ==
The text of the article mentioning Mr Hall in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was taken from the real 21 November 1922 issue of The Evening World. This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in 1926, but the actual events referenced occurred in 1922.
