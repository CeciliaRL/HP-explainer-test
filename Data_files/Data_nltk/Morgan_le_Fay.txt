In the 1998 television film Merlin, with Sam Neill as the title character, Morgan le Fay was portrayed by Helena Bonham Carter, who later went on to play Dark witch and Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange.
Before Emma Watson got the part of Hermione Granger, she had acted only in school plays; one was "Arthur's Early Years", in which she played the role of Morgan le Fay.
Morgan le Fay is based on the legendary figure of the same name, the daughter of King Arthur's mother the Lady Igraine and her first husband Gorlois, Duke of Cornwall (making her Arthur's half-sister in legend too).
Morgan le Fay's time of existence in the Harry Potter Universe (like Merlin, King Arthur etc) is paradoxical as the Morgan le Fay of the Arthurian legends is said to have lived in the 5th or 6th century. As Merlin attended Hogwarts and she was an enemy of Merlin, then she, like the legendary version of Merlin predates Hogwarts by around 400/500 years.
