This worm appeared in The Fountain of Fair Fortune in The Tales of Beedle the Bard. It was described as bloated and blind, with the ability to speak.


== History ==
The worm was the first obstacle on the way to the fountain, wrapping around the base of the hill. Sir Luckless attempted to slay the worm with his sword, and Altheda, Asha and Amata used magic against it, but the worm refused to let them pass until Asha began to weep. Then, it drank her tears and allowed the travellers to continue to the fountain.
