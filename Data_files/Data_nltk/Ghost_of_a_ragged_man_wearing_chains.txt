This ghost attended Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party on 31 October, 1992. He stood around the edge of the dance floor, and wore chains.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is unknown if this ghost resided at Hogwarts Castle or if he only came there to celebrate Sir Nicholas's Deathday.
The Ghost's description is reminiscent of the famous ghost created by Charles Dickens, Jacob Marley from his novel A Christmas Carol. It is possible that he is, in fact, Marley; an interpretation of the Deathday Party scene holds that all the unnamed ghosts are actually sneaky cameos, with the Knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead being Harold II Godwinson, and the Portly ghost being Daniel Lambert, among other things.
