Mary Dorkins was a Muggle television news reporter who worked for the seven o'clock news. She investigated the story of a water-skiing budgerigar named Bungy reported on 2 August 1995.


== Etymology ==
The name "Mary" is the usual English form of Maria, which was the Latin form of the New Testament Greek names Μαριαμ (Mariam) and Μαρια (Maria) - the spellings are interchangeable - which were from the Hebrew name מִרְיָם (Miryam). The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including "sea of bitterness", "rebelliousness", and "wished for child". However it was most likely originally an Egyptian name, perhaps derived in part from mry "beloved" or mr "love".


== Behind the scenes ==
Mary may be related to wizard Ragmar Dorkins.
