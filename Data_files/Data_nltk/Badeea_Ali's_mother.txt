Mrs Ali was a British Muggle woman who worked as an engineer. She disliked the fact that Muggle technology did not work at her witch daughter Badeea's school. She took her daughter bowling, but her daughter always ended up colouring. Sometime before 1 September 1989, her daughter cast the Star Shower Spell on top of their house, which made her angry. She was also known for being able to cook a delicious fish stew that reminded Badeea of home.
