Mrs Norris was the pet cat of Argus Filch, the caretaker of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Mrs Norris was described as having an unusually strong connection with her master, alerting him to any students misbehaving inside the school castle. She was described as appearing almost the same way as Filch, with bulging yellow, lamp-like eyes, a scrawny, skeletal body and dust-coloured fur.


== Biography ==


=== Under Argus Filch's ownership ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Mrs Norris on the look out for mischief makers 		 	 
Mrs Norris was born sometime prior to 1984, and become the pet cat of the Hogwarts school caretaker, Argus Filch. She formed an unusually strong bond with her owner, and often alerted him to any misbehaving students almost instantly. Because of this, she along with Filch were widely loathed by most of the Hogwarts student body, and many students had the urge to "give her a good kick".


==== 1991–1992 school year ====
During the 1991–1992 school year, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger often narrowly escaped the cat on their nightly trips through the school throughout their first year. Harry once got caught by her one day for tracking mud on the floor. She and Filch nearly caught Harry, Ron, Hermione and Neville Longbottom on the night Harry had gone to duel Draco Malfoy. To avoid them, they hid in a room on the forbidden third floor corridor, and unknowingly encountering Fluffy.
During the 1991 Christmas holidays when Harry and Ron first encountered the Mirror of Erised on a late night stroll, she noticed them being out of bed and wandering around the castle at night. Harry had a suspicion that she was able to see him even when he was under his Invisibility Cloak, although she may have just sensed someone there but cannot see, as cats are known to possess highly advanced senses that humans do not have.
In 1992, The trio encountered Mrs Norris at the foot of the stairs as they were wearing Harry's cloak at night, as they were going to the third floor corridor. She merely looked at them, and Ron recommended they kick her; however they just left her and continued to the third floor.


==== 1992–1993 school year ====
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Mrs Norris, petrified on the night of 31 October, 1992 		 	 
Mrs Norris was the first victim of the Serpent of Slytherin when the Chamber of Secrets was re-opened in 1992. On Hallowe'en night, she was petrified by the basilisk when she saw its reflection in a puddle of water in front of the unused bathroom, in the second floor. Ginny Weasley, possessed by Tom Marvolo Riddle, hung her from a torch bracket by her tail, where she was found by Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, next to the threatening message written on the wall. Headmaster Albus Dumbledore examined the cat but was unable to revive her. Argus Filch was devastated, and even accused Harry Potter of having attacked her. Thankfully, Mrs Norris was revived by Professor Pomona Sprout with the help of a Mandrake Restorative Draught at the end of the 1992–1993 school year.


==== 1993–1994 school year ====
In 1993, when Harry obtained the Marauder's Map from Fred and George Weasley, Mrs Norris showed up on the map, alerting the user to her presence, allowing Harry to carefully avoid being caught by her.


==== 1994–1995 school year ====
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Mrs Norris with Filch at the Yule Ball 		 	 During the 1994–1995 school year, Harry went to sneak into the Prefects' Bathroom at night wearing his Invisibility Cloak. Harry dropped his Golden egg behind a tapestry, and Filch and Mrs Norris found it. However, they were disturbed by Peeves who was causing trouble for them again, with Filch believing that Peeves had stolen the egg. When Severus Snape entered the scene, she left with Filch and Snape to find an intruder who Snape knew was about. Mrs Norris was able to smell Harry's bubblebath.
On Christmas day that year, Filch brought her to the Yule Ball being hosted in the Great Hall.
Later that school year, Ron Weasley recommended to Hermione Granger and Harry that they kidnap Mrs Norris to practise the Stunning Spell on; however, they did not go ahead with Ron's idea.


==== 1995–1996 school year ====
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Argus Filch showing respect to Professor Umbridge 		 	 
At the 1995 Welcoming Feast, Filch held Mrs Norris as he listened to Dolores Umbridge's introductory speech to Hogwarts in the Great Hall.
During the 1995–1996 school year, Harry came across Mrs Norris as he was going to the Owlery one evening. She came with Filch when he interrogated Harry in the Owlery, where Filch was dismissed by Cho Chang.
In December 1995, Mrs Norris encountered Harry, Ron and Minerva McGonagall going to the Headmaster's Office at night. She hissed faintly at them, but McGonagall shooed her away, with her retreating back into the shadows.
In 1996, Peeves locked Mrs Norris inside a suit of armour twice after Fred and George Weasley had instructed him to wreak as much havoc as possible on their departure from the school. Filch personally came to her rescue.


==== 1996–1997 school year ====
During the 1996–1997 school year, Mrs Norris encountered Harry, Ron and Ginny Weasley who were having a dispute in a school corridor, in which Ron fired an Orange spell at Ginny, his sister, which Mrs Norris alerted Filch of.
Mrs Norris later encountered Rubeus Hagrid, Harry and Hermione at the school at night with Filch, who got into a tense argument with Hagrid over the students being out of bed.


==== 1997–1998 school year ====


===== Battle of Hogwarts =====
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Mrs Norris with Filch before the battle 		 	 
Before the Battle of Hogwarts started, Mrs Norris was seen hissing, screeching and batting at some owls who had escaped from the Owlery to return them to their proper place.  
Mrs Norris was likely put away during the battle, being a cat. She survived the battle, and was with Filch as he swept up debris in the Great Hall, sitting next to a pile of rubble.


== Physical appearance ==
Mrs Norris was a dust-coloured cat with bulging yellow, lamp-like eyes, and a scrawny skeletal body.


== Personality and traits ==
Mrs Norris appeared to be a very intelligent and perspective cat, who often looked out for misbehaving students and seemed to be very good at spotting them. She also had an excellent knowledge of Hogwarts Castle. She also appeared to have a somewhat hostile temperament, often hissing at people, but she was very affectionate towards her owner Filch. This affection was not limited to just Filch, however; Mrs Norris showed a liking to a select few individuals, Alanza Alves and the Chimaera at the Magical Creatures Reserve being among them.
She may also have developed some sort of Occlumency, since Jacob's sibling couldn't access her mind, unlike Filch's. It's also possible that cats in general couldn't be used Legilimency.


== Relationships ==


=== Argus Filch ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Mrs Norris with her owner, Argus Filch 		 	 
Filch and Mrs Norris had an unusually close bond. Filch was extremely fond and protective of her. Even when patrolling separate corridors, the two seem to be able to communicate and Filch came directly to her when she spotted a student misbehaving. When she was attacked by the basilisk in 1992, Filch's first thought was that she was dead, and he was understandably devastated. It is unknown what happened to Mrs Norris after the war.


=== Rubeus Hagrid ===

Rubeus Hagrid could not stand her; as he was allergic to cats. He suspected that Filch set her up to follow him around whenever he came up to the school. Hagrid once remarked that he would like to introduce her to Fang, his pet dog. However, she seemed to respect the other Hogwarts teachers.


=== Hogwarts students ===
Mrs Norris was hated by a majority of the students. Much like her master, she had an excellent knowledge of the castle. Being caught misbehaving by her was just as bad as being caught by Filch, because she would fetch him straight away. It was the "dearest ambition of many to give Mrs Norris a good kick."


== Etymology ==
Rowling said she obtained the name Mrs Norris from a character in Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, who is similarly odious and is hanging around in the background frequently.


== Behind the scenes ==

Mrs Norris seems exceptionally smart for a cat, to the point that many have suspected she is a cat/Kneazle cross like Crookshanks or an Animagus. However, J. K. Rowling has stated on her website that she is just a highly unpleasant cat. This was confirmed again when Rowling stated on Twitter in response to a fan query that Mrs Norris would lose in a very brutal, close fight with Crookshanks, as Crookshanks's kneazle ancestry would eventually give him the edge.
Mrs Norris's role in the first two films is much the same as her role in the books. She also appears briefly in the third film and in the fourth and fifth films she, along with Filch, are used more as comic relief. In the fourth film, Argus Filch is seen dancing with her at the Yule Ball showing a brief sensitive side to Filch and showing his love for his cat, and on the fifth film Mrs Norris is seen climbing on Filch during the Welcoming Feast, while he is clapping enthusiastically at Dolores Umbridge's speech. She has significantly more screen time in the final film; Filch carries her as he runs into the Great Hall screaming that the students are out of bed, as well at the end of the film, where she is comically sitting next to a pile of rubble as Filch attempts to sweep.
In the earlier films, Mrs Norris has red eyes. In later films, however, she has blue eyes. Also, in the films, Mrs Norris has brown and grey fur.
The cat that played Mrs Norris is a Maine Coon. In sharp contrast to Mrs Norris's description in the books as being scrawny, Maine Coons are a large, stocky breed.
Several animal actors portray Mrs Norris throughout the films. The most notable include Maine Coons named Maximus, Alanis and Cornilus, and animatronics were also used. Specific animal actors were used for specific purposes. Maximus was trained to run alongside Filch and jump onto his shoulders, while Alanis was trained to be held in Filch's arms without squirming. She was so good at her job that often she fell asleep during shoots.
It is unknown if she joined the fight with or without Filch. It is unknown what happened to her after the war, although given her age of around 14 or possibly older during the Battle of Hogwarts, it is plausible that Mrs Norris had since passed away.
