Madame Glossy was presumably the witch who gave her name to Madame Glossy's Silver Polish and Madame Glossy's Self-Polishing Shoe Polish, presumably being the owner or operator of Madame Glossy's Finest Cleaning Products Ltd.. It is unknown whether she was the inventor or simply the manufacturer of these products.


== Etymology ==
The name Glossy comes from the adjective glossy, meaning "having a smooth, silklike, reflective surface". This suggests a rather effective silver polish.
