A host of waiters served food at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour on 1 August, 1997 at the Burrow.


== History ==
They wore white robes and arrived at two o'clock; while guests were arriving, they sat with the band under a tree close to the main tent, smoking pipes. After the vows were completed and the reception began, the waiters filled the tent and carried silver trays of Pumpkin juice, Butterbeer, and Firewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches.
When the reception was attacked by Death Eaters that evening following the fall of the Ministry of Magic, the waiters presumably fled, along with most of the guests.
