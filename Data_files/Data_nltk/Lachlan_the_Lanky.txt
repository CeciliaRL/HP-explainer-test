Lachlan the Lanky was a wizard from an unknown period. A statue of him was located on the Seventh floor of Hogwarts Castle.
Ronald Weasley once hid behind this statue to avoid being found by Fred and George Weasley, whom he felt would tease him for trying out for the position of Keeper on the Gryffindor Quidditch team.
