These three individuals were wizards and Snatchers during the height of the Second Wizarding War.


== Biography ==
Just before midnight, on 1 May, 1998, these three Snatchers were led to the Hogwarts Grounds by Scabior in order to take part in the Battle of Hogwarts. Apparently unaware of them, these three wizards ran straight into the protective enchantments placed around the Castle, and disintegrated on the spot. This led the Snatcher army to wait outside the Wooden Bridge until the Death Eaters had broken the magical protection.


== Behind the scenes ==
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, the snatchers do not appear. However, the shield that protected Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry simply repels the enemies rather than disintegrating them.


== Appearances ==
