The Captain of the Brigade of Witch-Hunters was a character in popular wizarding tale Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump, by Beedle the Bard.


== History ==

According to the tale, the Brigade of Witch-Hunters was created a long time ago by a Muggle King of a very far away land who wanted to keep all the magic in the world for himself. In order to do so, he needed to gather all the wizards and witches in the world, so he formed the Brigade and ordered this man its captain.
Later in the tale, the Captain requested the King to bring Sabre, a hound from the Brigade, back to life with his "wand" (actually a twig with no magical powers whatsoever sold to him by a Charlatan). When the King's court mocked him for having no magical powers, he ordered the charlatan to be killed, however, the charlatan told him that Babbitty, a witch and the King's washerwoman, was blocking his spells. When Babbitty denounced the charlatan for the fraud he was, she proposed the Captain to cut him in half, a deed the Captain was eager to do.
