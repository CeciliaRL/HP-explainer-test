Jimbo Blishwick was a pure-blood wizard. He married pure-blood witch Misapinoa Black.


== Behind the scenes ==
This character appears only on the version of the Black family tree shown in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. He was not included on the version of the tree which J. K. Rowling gave to a charity auction in 2006. However, according to director David Yates, Rowling provided the filmmakers with a copy of the Black family tree going back eight generations. The filmmakers presumably received a more complete version of the tree than the one auctioned off, which only goes back six generations.


== Etymology ==
Jimbo is a diminutive form of the given name James.
