This individual worked as the station master at Aviemore train station in 1981. He speaks in very strong Scots.
When they inadvertently were brought back in time to 1981 by Delphini, wandless and broomless Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy walked from the Hogwarts grounds to Aviemore train station. There, they learned from the oblivious station master that it was the day before Lord Voldemort killed James and Lily Potter, and the two boys journeyed to Godric's Hollow in the West Country to prevent Delphini from changing history.
