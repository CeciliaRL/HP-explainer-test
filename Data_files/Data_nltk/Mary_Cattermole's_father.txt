The father of Mary Cattermole was a Muggle greengrocer, as was his wife.
Their daughter was a Muggle-born witch who eventually married Reginald Cattermole and had three children. Her blood status caused her trial with the Muggle-Born Registration Commission in 1997, when Lord Voldemort infiltrated the Ministry of Magic. On her questionnaire, she mentioned her parents' professions, which was inadvisable, as it made it extremely obvious to the unsympathetic regime at the time that she had no blood ancestry. Fortunately, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley, who were all in disguise, saved Mary from going to prison and advised her to flee the country.
