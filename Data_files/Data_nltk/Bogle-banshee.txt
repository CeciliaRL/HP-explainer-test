The bogle-banshee was allegedly a Banshee, a dark spirit which dwelt in the city of Kathmandu, Nepal. On the "Second Year Essential Knowledge Test" that Gilderoy Lockhart gave to his second-year Defence Against the Dark Arts class in 1992, there was a question that asked "What, in your opinion, is Gilderoy Lockhart's greatest achievement to date?", to which one student answered "to banish the bogle-banshee in Katmandu [sic]." The defeat of this creature was possibly covered in Break with a Banshee.
