This Slytherin knight was a wizard who had a portrait hung of himself at Hogwarts Castle.


== Biography ==


=== 1991–1992 school year ===
In Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he was guarding a secret room in the upper castle's Portrait Room, concealing an advanced form of the Knockback Jinx. The password was "Wolf's Bane".


=== 1992–1993 school year ===
A year later, his portrait had been moved, and now guarded the way to the Slytherin Duelling Dungeon. Another identical portrait was also created that guarded a hot-air well-lifting room inside an area behind a bookcase in the Knights' Room. He was kept with company by the Hufflepuff lady.


== Behind the scenes ==
This wizard may have passed away sometime prior to 1991 as many portraits hung at Hogwarts Castle depict deceased individuals.
His attitude against Harry Potter was good when he spoke to him in the two secret rooms behind the bookcases and bad when it was guarding the Slytherin Duelling Dungeon.
