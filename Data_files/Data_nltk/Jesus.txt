Jesus, also known as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was the central figure of Christianity, regarded by most Christian denominations as the son of God, born of a human mother, Mary. He was considered an important prophet in Islam.
There was a stained glass window in the St Jerome's Church in Godric's Hollow which depicted Jesus along with the authors of the four books of the Gospel (Matthew, Mark, Luke and John).
One of the known works by artist Haniball Carathi was a "little piece" depicting "our Ladie" (i.e., Mary) with the presumably infant Jesus "upon her right hand." A catalogue listing for this work was incorporated into the label of the Belch Powder box.
