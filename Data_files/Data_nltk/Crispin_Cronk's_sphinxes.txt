Crispin Cronk's sphinxes were several pet Sphinxes that Crispin Cronk insisted on keeping in his backyard.


== History ==
During the 19th century, the domestication and private ownership of Sphinxes was illegal and, after Cronk refused to hand his sphinxes over to the British Ministry of Magic, the Ministry was forced to convict Cronk and send him to Azkaban.
It is unknown what happened to Cronk's sphinxes after this point, however, it is presumed that they were taken into the care of the Beast Division of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures and returned to their native land of Egypt.
