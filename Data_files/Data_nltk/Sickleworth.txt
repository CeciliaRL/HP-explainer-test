Sickleworth was a Niffler owned by Gringotts Wizarding Bank, assigned to Patricia Rakepick to aid in her assignments by burrowing underground in search of treasure at cursed sites. Rakepick chose his name because he is "incredibly sweet, and utterly destructive."

In the 1987â€“1988 school year, Rakepick allowed Professor Silvanus Kettleburn to borrow Sickleworth for a Care of Magical Creatures class. Rakepick also allowed Jacob's sibling to temporarily use the Niffler to search for the head of Torvus' arrow.
The following year, Sickleworth was present in Defence Against the Dark Arts classes taught by Rakepick. During these classes, he occasionally let the Pixies escape. After Rakepick left the school, she left Sickleworth behind.
