This individual was a wizard, whose portrait hung at Hogwarts Castle in the 1990s, below a portrait of three young ladies, on the seventh-floor level of the Grand Staircase. He was bald, very pale and dressed in black robes, flowing as though rushed by a strong wind.


== Behind the scenes ==
This portrait bears an uncanny resemblance to Lord Voldemort, in his appearance from the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire onwards. However, it seems rather unlikely a portrait of him would have been hung at Hogwarts under the supervision of Albus Dumbledore.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) (First appearance) (Appears in portrait(s))
