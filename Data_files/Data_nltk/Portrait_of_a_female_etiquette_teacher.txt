This woman was a witch who taught etiquette to students of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She had a portrait hung in Gryffindor Tower by the 1990s.


== Behind the scenes ==
The subject of this portrait was portrayed by actress Claire Carroll.
In The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, this portrait, along with the Portrait of a Professor and the portrait of a Quidditch player, explains in magical terms how the ride portion of Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey will work.
Etiquette is not a subject known to be taught at Hogwarts, but it is possible that it was sometime in history.
