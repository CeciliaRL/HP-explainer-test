This group of women in crinolines were depicted in a picture hung at Hogwarts Castle. Their portrait hung at the bottom of the Divination Stairwell in the North Tower, at the end of the Divination corridor. When Sir Cadogan lead Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger to the Divination Classroom, they passed through this portrait, whose occupants were alarmed by Sir Cadogan's sudden appearance.
