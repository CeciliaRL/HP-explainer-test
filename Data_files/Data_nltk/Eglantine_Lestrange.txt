Eglantine Lestrange was a French witch and a member of the pure-blood Lestrange family. She was the daughter of Falco Lestrange and Salom√© Lestrange. She married her cousin Corvus Lestrange and had a son with him, Corvus, through whom she was the grandmother of Leta Lestrange and Corvus Lestrange.


== Etymology ==
Eglantine's name originates from Old French and it means "spiny, needle-like", which is in reference to the thorns of the eglantine, which is a wild rose also known as sweet briar.


== Behind the scenes ==
Unlike all other spouses included in the family tree (Heloise Beaufort, Minette Rosier, Laurena Kama, and Clarisse Tremblay), Eglantine is depicted with the Lestrange surname. This might signify a case of inbreeding, since this was reported as a practise of the Lestrange family.
A family tree released later reveals that Eglantine and Corvus (III) were first cousins, as their fathers (Falco and Corvus (II), respectively) were brothers.
