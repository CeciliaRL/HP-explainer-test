== Biography ==


=== 1994–1995 ===
She was friends with Cho Chang and often walked around Hogwarts with a group of fellow Ravenclaw girls during the 1994–1995 school year. Sitting across from Cho, she was one of the two girls at the Ravenclaw table when Harry spilt his tea while attempting to smile at Cho.
At the end of the school year, she attended the memorial feast to Cedric Diggory, and was seen sitting somewhere behind the trio.

She was then seen in Dumbledore's Army's lessons and practised defensive magic due to Professor Dolores Umbridge refusing to teach practical Defence Against the Dark Arts. Heading to one meeting in the Room of Requirement, Cho and her, along with two other students, were seen followed by Argus Filch and Mrs Norris.
She attended a couple of meetings, including when the group learned the Stunning Spell; she witnessed Nigel Wolpert practising on Harry Potter, as well as when Hermione Granger used it on Ron Weasley. She laughed at Ron when he was thrown across the room, and fussed over Hermione afterward.

In 1998 she was part of the group of students who were hiding in the Room of Requirement. She participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, and was present when the Death Eaters arrived at the Viaduct Courtyard with Harry Potter's "corpse", and for Ginny Weasley's scream, which Arthur Weasley stopped.
