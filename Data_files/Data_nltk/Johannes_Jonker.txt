Johannes Jonker was an American No-Maj born wizard. He, along with Shikoba Wolfe, Thiago Quintana, and Violetta Beauvais, was one of four wandmakers who served North America in the early 20th century


== Biography ==
Jonker was born to No-Maj parents. His father was a successful cabinet maker, which presumably gave him early experience with wood-working, and allowed him to become a skilled wandmaker in his own right. Jonker's wands were in great demand and could be easily identified by the mother-of-pearl inlay they typically contained. Jonker experimented with several different wand cores before settling on hair of the Wampus cat as his preferred kind.
By 1926, he was a known wandmaker and listed on the Magical Congress of the United States of America's Wand permit form.
