Abraham Potter was an American wizard and one of the original twelve Aurors in the United States of America.


== Biography ==
Abraham was born into the American branch of the Potter family, which traces its origins to Ignotus Peverell, one of the three brothers mentioned in The Tale of the Three Brothers in The Tales of Beedle the Bard; and Linfred of Stinchcombe, nicknamed The Potterer, a pioneering potioneer credited with the invention of numerous medicinal potions. This makes him a distant relative of the famous Harry Potter, a fact which would be uncovered by eager genealogists centuries later.
After completing a surely arduous process, Abraham became an Auror. He was, along with eleven other wizards and witches, one of the first Aurors in the United States of America, being recruited by Josiah Jackson, the first President of MACUSA.
He died before reaching "old age."


== Behind the scenes ==
Despite being a Potter, Abraham was not featured on the Potter family tree on  Pottermore.
It is likely that Abraham had descendants. However, it remains unknown whether Harry is aware of their existence.
