Charles Demengeot was a 19th century French heraldic engraver and typographer, who published Dictionnaire du Chiffre-monogramme dans les Styles Moyen-age et Renaissance et couronnes nobilaires universelles 1881, a work that famously includes a monogram of the entire alphabet.
By 1992, there was an aged poster featuring the frontispiece of his work, posted on the walls on Knockturn Alley.


== Behind the scenes ==
Demengeot's work seems to have influenced the graphical typefaces in some of the logos and monograms featured in some of the props in the Harry Potter films. Good examples of this are, for instance, the Beauxbatons crest, which seems to have been inspired in this monogram (top), and the logo of Advocates to the Wizarding World, which seems to have been based on this one (third one from the top, on the right).
