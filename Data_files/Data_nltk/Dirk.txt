"Dodgy" Dirk (fl. 1932 â€” 1972) was an English Muggle who lived in Ilfracombe, notable for eluding the mass Memory Charms after witnessing the Ilfracombe Incident of 1932.


== Biography ==
In 1932, a Common Welsh Green dragon descended upon a crowded beach in Ilfracombe, attacking a group of sunbathers, among which was Dirk, who had his lilo pierced by the beast. By sheer chance, the wizarding Toke family was on the beach during the attack, and managed to protect the beach-goers, and proceeding to perform a multitude of Memory Charms in order to make the non-magical folk forget about the attack. 
However, Dirk somehow managed to evade the Memory Charms, and went on for at least forty years afterwards frequenting bars along the south coast of England, talking about the day a "dirty great flying lizard" poked a hole in his lilo, gaining the nickname "Dodgy" Dirk. 
Blenheim Stalk mentioned this in his 1972 book Muggles Who Notice.


== Behind the Scenes ==
The name "Li-lo" was registered as a product trademark in the UK on 19 April 1944, making its use describing an incident in 1932 possibly anachronistic; however Dirk may have taken to calling it this after the term entered common use.
