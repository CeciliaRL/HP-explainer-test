This witch was said to be Credence Barebone's biological mother.


== History ==
Sometime in 1901, she gave birth to Credence Barebone.


=== After death ===
She was mentioned to Credence by Mary Lou Barebone, seconds before getting ready to abuse him after suspecting Modesty Barebone's toy wand was his.
It is unknown what happened to her, but it is possible that she died prior to 1926, as Mary Lou referred to her in the past tense.
