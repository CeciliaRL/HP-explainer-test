== Biography ==
Born in c. 1992 to a pure-blood or half-blood witch somewhere in Ireland or Great Britain,, Montgomery had at least two sisters who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry sometime from 1990 to 1996.
When he was five years old, his mother supposedly refused to aid the Death Eaters in their cause and hence they ordered the werewolf Fenrir Greyback to attack the little boy. Although he was taken to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, the healers there could not save him and he died.
