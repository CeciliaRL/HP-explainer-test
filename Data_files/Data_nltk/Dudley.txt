Mr Dudley may have been a wizard who worked in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. When Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger were caught by Snatchers in 1998, Harry quickly invented the pseudonym Vernon Dudley to conceal his identity, combining the first names of his uncle and cousin. Pressed for the identity of his father by Scabior, one of the Snatchers, Harry claimed to be the son of a wizard who worked in the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. Scabior responded to this by stating that he believed someone named Dudley actually worked in that department.
