This individual was a witch or wizard who became the professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, for the 1986â€“1987 school year. 
They were considered far from an improvement of the previous year's professor, which made Tulip Karasu wonder whether they would ever learn the Boggart-Banishing Spell if they continued to teach the subject.
The professor was unable to continue teaching the subject in the next school year, because of Lord Voldemort's jinx which ensured the teacher of the subject would have needed to be replaced by the end of the year.
According to Jacob's sibling, this teacher was the worst out of their first five teachers.
