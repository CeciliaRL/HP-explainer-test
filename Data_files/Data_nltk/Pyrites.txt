Pyrites (fl. 1981) was a wizard and a servant of Lord Voldemort at around the time of the First Wizarding War. He was a dandy wizard who often wore white silk gloves, which would sometimes be stained with blood.


== Etymology ==
Pyrites is named after the mineral, which is more commonly known as fool's gold.


== Behind the scenes ==
Pyrites only appears in early drafts of the first chapter of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. In these drafts, he would have met up with Sirius Black in front of the Potter cottage. The character was cut entirely, however, with the switch in perspective to Vernon Dursley's day rather than the scene at Godric's Hollow.
He may have been related to Argo Pyrites, the author of Alchemy, Ancient Art and Science, or the two might have been one and the same.
