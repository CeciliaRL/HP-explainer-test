Karkus's wife was a giantess who lived in the last remaining colony of giants in Europe. As of 1995, her husband was the Gurg of the colony, who regularly demanded the other giants to bring food for the two of them. However, that year Karkus was killed by Golgomath, who took over the position as Gurg.
It is unknown what happened to Karkus's wife afterwards.
