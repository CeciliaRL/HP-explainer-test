Mr Longbottom (pre-1947â€”between 1980 and 1995) was a pure-blood wizard. He was the father of Frank Longbottom and the paternal grandfather of Neville Longbottom.


== Biography ==
Mr Longbottom was born sometime before 1947 into the Longbottom family, an old British pure-blood family, considered to be one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight. He had one known sibling, a brother, Algie, and may have had others.
He married a witch, Augusta, with whom he had one son, Frank.
He died sometime between 1980 and 1995. His grandson, Neville, witnessed his death, thus enabling the boy to see Thestrals at a young age. Neville revealed as much to Hagrid and Dolores Umbridge during her time evaluating a Care of Magical Creatures lesson.


== Behind the scenes ==
Neville states in The Queen's Handbag that, in 1947, his "granddad" put a fanged gerbil into Augusta's handbag as a joke, prompting her to keep a mousetrap in her bag at all times thereafter. It is likely that this refers to Mr Longbottom, rather than to Neville's maternal grandfather, i.e. Alice Longbottom's father.
