Philbert Deverill was a wizard who was the manager of Quidditch team Puddlemere United. He once said to the Daily Prophet that Puddlemere United would change their robe colours from mud-brown to something "more striking". He was as mystified as everyone else when his side hit a winning streak.


== Etymology ==
The name "Philbert" is an early variant of Filibert altered by association with Greek φιλος (philos) "dear, beloved". This was the name of a 7th-century Frankish saint. Another famous bearer was Philibert de l'Orme (1510-1570), a French Renaissance architect.
