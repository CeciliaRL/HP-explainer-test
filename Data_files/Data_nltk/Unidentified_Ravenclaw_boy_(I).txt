This unidentified boy was a wizard who started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1997, who was sorted into Ravenclaw. Right before the Battle of Hogwarts on 1 May 1998, he prodded Alecto Carrow in Ravenclaw Tower while she was unconscious, saying hopefully that she might be dead.
