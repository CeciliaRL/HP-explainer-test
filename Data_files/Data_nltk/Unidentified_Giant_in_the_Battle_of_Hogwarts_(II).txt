== Behind the scenes ==
This giant is played by Gary Sayer in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
In the film he had a bit of hair, but in the video game he was completely bald.
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 he is seen standing in a courtyard in which he sees the trio. When he runs after them he collapses with the wall and falls to the ground. Some of the torches and a bit roof burries him. However he breaks free and is later seen close to the Wooden Bridge fighting Grawp. He is then killed by two suits of armour.
This giant's reddish skin and the small, horn-like protrusions over his eyes give him a resemblance to an Oni, and ogre-like creature from Japanese mythology.
