This individual was the wife of wizard Baruffio. Once, while trying to conjure furs for his wife, Baruffio mispronounced the spell, leaving her with a buffalo on her shoulders.


== Behind the scenes ==

In the original English version of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Baruffio mispronounces "s" instead of "f" and ends up with a buffalo on his chest. On the French translation, Baruffio's incident is slightly different. It introduces another character: Baruffio's wife. Quoting from the French translation: "N'oubliez jamais le sorcier Baruffio qui avait un défaut de prononciation et dont la femme s'est retrouvée avec un bison sur les épaules au lieu d'un vison". (Loosely translated: "Remember wizard Baruffio who had a speech impediment and whose wife was left with a buffalo on her shoulders instead of a mink".). The translator, Jean-François Ménard, plays with the alliteration "bison"/"vison" ("buffalo"/"mink"). As it is usually women who wear furs, the introduction of a female character was necessary. This change in translation is maintained on the French language version of  Pottermore when Baruffio is mentioned in the entry for The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 1.
