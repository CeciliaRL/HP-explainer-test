This Death Eater was at Gringotts Wizarding Bank as Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, Hermione Granger and Griphook staged a break-in to retrieve Helga Hufflepuff's Cup from the Lestrange Vault.
Later that day, he was killed by Lord Voldemort in a fit of rage at Malfoy Manor, after the Dark Lord was informed by Goblins working at Gringotts that Harry Potter had managed to steal Helga Hufflepuff's Cup from him.
