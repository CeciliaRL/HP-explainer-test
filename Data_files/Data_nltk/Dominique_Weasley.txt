== Etymology ==
Dominique is the French feminine form of the masculine name Dominic, derived from the Late Latin Dominicus, meaning "of the Lord". It was traditionally given to a child born on Sunday in Catholic countries. It is also the name of a popular French song by Soeur Sourire, the Belgian "Singing Nun", about Saint Dominic and his fight against the Albigensians.
