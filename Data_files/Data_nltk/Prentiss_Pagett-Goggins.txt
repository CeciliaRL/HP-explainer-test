Lady Prentiss Pagett-Goggins was a witch. There was a portrait of her inside the Hogwarts Castle.


== Biography ==
The portrait of Prentiss Pagett-Goggins had once been placed in a house which burned down over a century ago. She was then moved to the Hogwarts Castle, but was stashed down into the dungeons due to her keep ordering wizards to get her tea.
Before Hallowe'en in 2009, she was invited to Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's 517th Deathday Party. When a group of students came to the dungeons to search for a map for their History of Magic assignment, she responded when one of them asked about it. She asked them to move her back to the Grand Staircase, which Sir Nicholas agreed since she was not his favourite either. Upon return, she said her old neighbours had talked about the map, but they had been moved away during the Battle of Hogwarts. She described the place where one of them was moved to, which was identified as the Chamber of Secrets by the student. She reunited with her neighbours, namely Basil Aurelius III and Harold, after the students found them and returned them to their original place.
