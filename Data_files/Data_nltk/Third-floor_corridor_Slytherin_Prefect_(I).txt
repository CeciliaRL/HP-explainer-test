This individual (born c. 1974â€“1976) was a wizard who, in the early 1990s, was one of the Slytherin Prefects at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


== Biography ==

He was patrolling the third-floor corridor on the night of 4 June, 1992. When Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger passed by Peeves, he heard something and started pacing fast by the corner to the Forbidden Corridor.


== Behind the scenes ==
This NPC has the distinction of making its only appearance when the player is making its way to the Forbidden Corridor. Unlike the other Prefects in night sneak missions, who are recurring and sometimes copies of sprites depicting first-year students during the day, this character makes a single appearance during the entire game.


== Appearances ==
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) (First appearance) (GBA version)
