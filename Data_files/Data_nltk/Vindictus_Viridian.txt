== Biography ==


=== Lifetime ===
Based on his portrait, Viridian was a potioneer. At some point in his life, he was named Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Also during his lifetime, he published a famous book on dark charms: Curses and Counter-Curses (Bewitch your Friends and Befuddle your Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly-Legs, Tongue-Tying and much, much more).

 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Professor Viridian's portrait in the Headmaster's office 		 	 
Professor Viridian died sometime in or prior to 1994. Two portraits of him hung at Hogwarts: one was painted in 1703 and hung in the Headmaster's office along with the portraits of other Headmasters and Headmistresses, and the other hung in the Grand Staircase.
In the 1995-1996 school year, Viridian's portrait at the Grand Staircase was used to conceal the entrance to the Room of Rewards. He was frequently annoyed by all the hustle and bustle of the students' school life. In order to gain entry to the Room of Rewards, Hermione Granger threatened to convince Myrtle Warren to haunt the landing where the portrait hung. Disliking Myrtle, Viridian let Harry Potter and his friends through.
