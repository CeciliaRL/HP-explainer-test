Professor Arif Sikander was a wizard who acted as the replacement Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990â€“1991 school year, whilst the former teacher Quirinus Quirrell was away on a sabbatical trip in Europe.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Muggle Studies: As a professor of Muggle Studies at Hogwarts, Sikander was highly knowledgeable of Muggles and their ways of living.


== Etymology ==
Arif is a male Arabic name meaning "knowledgeable" or "wise". Sikandar is the Persian version of the name Alexander, meaning "to defend man".


== Behind the scenes ==
This character appears to have been modeled after an unnamed background character that made an appearance in the first film, suggesting that the two are supposed to be the same person.
Assuming Professor Sikander was offered the post full-time once it became clear that Quirrell would switch subjects rather than return to it, this would also imply that Sikander was the male Muggle Studies professor mentioned in the video game adaption of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.


== Appearances ==

Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film) (Possible appearance)
Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery (First appearance)
