Don Harrison was a British Muggle construction foreman. 


== Biography ==
When beginning construction project in a forest that was home to magical beasts, his site and workers were attacked. Six of the workers walked off the job as a result.
Harrison's daughter Bethany was at the site during the attack and made a drawing of the beast responsible.
During the subsequent Ministry of Magic investigation (during which Mathilda Grimblehawk and Mathilda Grimblehawk's partner, of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, posed as Muggle inspectors from the local constabulary), his daughter Bethany went missing. A distraught Don Harrison pledged to level the whole forest to find her, before being calmed down by Mathilda, who assured him they would find his daughter.
