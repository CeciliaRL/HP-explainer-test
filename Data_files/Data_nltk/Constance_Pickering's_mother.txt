This witch was the mother of Constance Pickering.


== Biography ==
Until the Ministry of Magic sent her a notice about permits and licencing, she used to make and sell batches of "special" pumpkin juice for grown-ups only.
During Christmas, she and her daughter pulled crackers together. The pop always made little Constance squeal with delight. The family were never able to have a tree at they house, because Constance's mum said she was "allergic" to decorating. Constance loved looking in their neighbours windows and seeing their trees, all bright and shiny.
Before the start of Constance's first year at Hogwarts, her mother wouldn't buy her a new cauldron. She gave Constance her brother's old, used one and bought him a new one.
In 2019, the Pickering family had Christmas at the new house of Constance's sister, but they did not send Constance any details or address. As a result, Constance was invited to a Christmas dinner at the Potter family's house instead.
