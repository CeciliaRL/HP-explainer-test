Martin "Tiny" Helstrom was Nordic wizard who played as Keeper on the Nordic National Quidditch team during the four-hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup, in 1994.
During the 1996–1997 school year, Helstrom's Chocolate Frog Card was able to be won by beating Ronald Weasley at a duelling challenge.


== Etymology ==
The name "Martin" comes from the Roman name Martinus, which was derived from Martis, the genitive case of the name of the Roman god MARS. Saint Martin of Tours was a 4th-century bishop who is the patron saint of France. According to legend, he came across a cold beggar in the middle of winter so he ripped his cloak in two and gave half of it to the beggar. He was a favourite saint during the Middle Ages, and his name has become common throughout the Christian world.
Helstrøm is a Danish surname, possibly indicating that Martin is Danish. It is also a surname of the Norwegian chef Eyvind Hellstrøm.
