Bilius Finbok was an English wizard that lived in Cornwall and worked in the British Ministry of Magic's Department of Intoxicating Substances. He was described by Mathilda Grimblehawk as smelling of sulphur and able to mix terrific cocktails.


== Biography ==
Finbok may have been in Hufflepuff House at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as there was a Hufflepuff scarf in his cottage and in his secret owlery.
His disappearance from his cottage was investigated by Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner. He was found to have been transported to St David's, a Muggle hospital, after his Muggle neighbour Sara Farnham discovered him injured and unconscious.
Ultimately, his injuries were linked to the use of illegal materials from magical beasts in the brewing of potions, for which he was summoned to appear before the Ministry.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Potions: Finbok was proficient in the magical art and science of potion-making, brewing many experimental mixtures in his spare time as an amateur Potioneer. These used an eclectic range of different ingredients, some of which were illegally sourced.
Expert mixologist: Finbok was known for his skill in mixing cocktails. This was likely an offshoot of potion experiments, and his familiarity with various types of alcohol through his work.
Underworld connections: Some of his potion ingredients were illegally sourced, suggesting he was familiar with at least one disreputable merchant to obtain them.
