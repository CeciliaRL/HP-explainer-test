Cyclops was a one-eyed Giant from Ancient Greece. He lived in a cave at the foot of Mount Etna. He was slain by the Greek hero, Odysseus, who used several sheep to help him do this task.


== Behind the scenes ==
Cyclops is based on Polyphemus, a cyclops that appears in Greek mythology, most prominently in Homer's Odyssey. In the Odyssey, Polyphemus was not slain by Odysseus, but merely blinded; and cyclopes are a separate species from giants.
