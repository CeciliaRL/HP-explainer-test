A male second cousin of Molly Weasley (n√©e Prewett) became an accountant and/or a stockbroker in the Muggle world. Ron Weasley told Harry Potter that this man was never spoken of in the Weasley household.


== Behind the scenes ==
J. K. Rowling revealed on her website that in an early draft of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, this character was married to a Muggle woman, and, against all expectation, had fathered a daughter who was a witch, Mafalda. Although he had previously been rude to Mr and Mrs Weasley, he and his wife were to have sought the Weasley family's help in introducing Mafalda to wizarding culture when they learned that she would be attending Hogwarts.
The information on Rowling's website states that Molly's second cousin was a stockbroker. This conflicts with Ron Weasley's statement in Philosopher's Stone that he was an accountant. However, it is possible that Ron, being unfamiliar with the Muggle world, was merely incorrect.
