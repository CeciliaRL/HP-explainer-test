This hummingbird was used in Department of Mysteries to research life and death in the Time Room. It lived in a bell jar, which allowed it to become an egg, a chick, an adult, and then start life over again. During the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, the bird was released and an unidentified Death Eater replaced it.
In September 2020, during the Calamity, this hummingbird appeared as a Foundable. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were able to return to his original time.
