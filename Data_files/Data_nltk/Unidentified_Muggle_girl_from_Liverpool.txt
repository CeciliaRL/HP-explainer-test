This Muggle girl from Liverpool was someone that the late Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore took a fancy to in his youth. A woman featured on a Divine Magic billboard made Albus remember about this girl.


== Behind the scenes ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			The Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film) script page. 		 	 

This character was created to be mentioned in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince by her former boyfriend, Professor Dumbledore. However, the character was cut from the film when J. K. Rowling scribbled out her mention in the script and revealed that Dumbledore was gay. As such, this character is not considered to be canon.
Rowling's note about this character marked the first time that Dumbledore was "outed", although Rowling does not directly indicate his orientation in any of the books beyond her subtle hints in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
