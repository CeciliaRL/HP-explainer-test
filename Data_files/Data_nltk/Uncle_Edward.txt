Uncle Edward was an American poltergeist who haunted a New York wizarding family.
Although usually calm in temperament, one day in 1926 he had an argument with the family he haunted during a picnic in Central Park, and proceeded to throw baked goods at passing No-Majs, disappearing afterwards. The incident was reported in the 6 December 1926 morning edition of The New York Ghost as possibly jeopardising wizarding secrecy.
