This Wizard attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup and sat in the stands across from the Top Box of the Quidditch World Cup Stadium. Ron Weasley looked at this wizard through a pair of Omnioculars while he picked his nose and used the replay function on them to make him do the same thing numerous times.
