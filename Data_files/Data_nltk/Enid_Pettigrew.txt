Enid Pettigrew was a witch. She may be a relative of Mrs Pettigrew and her son, Peter.


== Behind the scenes ==
Professor Pettigrew was one of the names which J. K. Rowling considered giving to either the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor in Harry Potter's fourth, sixth or seventh year or the Divination teacher during his third year when she was planning Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, although she decided on Sybill Trelawney instead.


== Etymology ==
The name "Enid" is derived from Welsh enaid meaning "soul" or "life". She was the wife of Geraint in Arthurian legend.
