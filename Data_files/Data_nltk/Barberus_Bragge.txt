Chief Barberus Bragge (fl. 1269) was a British wizard and chief of the Wizards' Council in the 1260s. He was responsible for the introduction of the Golden Snidget into Cuaditch, thus changing the face of Quidditch forever. For this, he was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Bragge was most likely born between the mid to late-twelfth century and the early-thirteenth century. He presumably attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in his youth, like so many other wizards before him.


=== As Chief of the Wizards' Council ===
During a Cuaditch (period-Quidditch) game in 1269, Chief Bragge released a Golden Snidget onto the field, and offered the player who captured it one-hundred and fifty Galleons. In protest, the witch Modesty Rabnott summoned the Snidget to her and fled the game. Bragge was furious and was almost going to hex her, when his advisors calmed him down and she was fined ten Galleons for disrupting the game. However, the idea caught on, and soon the Snidget was a part of the game, with a new player, the Hunter (Seeker), being added to the team.
