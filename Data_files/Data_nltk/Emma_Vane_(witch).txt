Emma Vane was a student who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991. In her third year, her mother, Mrs Vane, signed the permission slip that was required for her to visit Hogsmeade village on weekends.
She may have been related to Romilda Vane.


== Etymology ==
The name "Emma" was originally a short form of Germanic names that began with the element ermen meaning "whole" or "universal". It was introduced to England by Emma of Normandy, who was the wife both of king Ethelred II (and by him the mother of Edward the Confessor) and later of king Canute. It was also borne by an 11th-century Austrian saint, who is sometimes called Hemma. After the Norman conquest this name became common in England. It was revived in the 18th century, perhaps in part due to Matthew Prior's poem Henry and Emma (1709). It was also used by Jane Austen for the central character, the matchmaker Emma Woodhouse, in her novel Emma (1816).


== Behind the scenes ==
This character is mentioned only on a prop permission slip that was featured in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Her name is presumably a tribute to Emma Vane, who worked as a draughtsman on every Harry Potter film up until Half-Blood Prince, excepting Chamber of Secrets.
