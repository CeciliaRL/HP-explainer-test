This witch was the mother of the Montgomery sisters and their younger brother. When she refused to help the Death Eaters in 1997 and support their cause, her then five-year-old son was attacked by the bloodthirsty werewolf Fenrir Greyback, on the Death Eaters' orders. The boy later died in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries from his injuries, as the Healers there were unable to save his life given the grave extent of his injuries.
