Podric Batworthy, O.M. (First Class), (Grand Sorc.), was a wizard whose portrait hung at Hogwarts Castle in the 1990s. Batworthy lived in or after the 15th century, seeing as that was when the Wizengamot created the Order of Merlin award.
Podric Batworthy is, in all likelihood, an ancestor of Podric Batworthy XXIII, who ran Beard Trimming in Diagon Alley in the 1990s.
