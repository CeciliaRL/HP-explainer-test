Hector Lamont was a Scottish wizard, and the Seeker for the Scottish International Quidditch team.
He played in the final of the 1990 Quidditch World Cup where he missed the Snitch by millimetres, leading to his team's defeat. After the game, Lamont famously lambasted his father ("Stubby" Lamont) for not giving him longer fingers.
