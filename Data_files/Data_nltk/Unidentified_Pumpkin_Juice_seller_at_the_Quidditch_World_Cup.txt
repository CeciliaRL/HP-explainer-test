This wizard sold pumpkin juice at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.
He was quite capable of using the Levitation Charm, doing so to move the glasses of pumpkin juice over the counter to his customers.
He wore a pointed green wizard's hat and matching green robes. He smiled broadly, chatting happily to his customers as he magically poured the drinks and brought them over the counter to them.
