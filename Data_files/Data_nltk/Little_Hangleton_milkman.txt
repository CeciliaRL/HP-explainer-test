This individual was a British Muggle man, who served Little Hangleton in the capacity of milkman in the late 20th century. 


== Behind the scenes ==
This individual replaces the role of Frank Bryce in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4. Despite this, it is highly likely that he still existed canonically as the Milkman of Little Hangleton.
Instead of noticing the lights on on the second floor, the milkman notices empty milk bottles on the front steps of the Riddle House.
His death at the hands of Lord Voldemort cannot be considered canonical, as no echo of him emerges from Voldemort's wand during the Duel in Little Hangleton, and further in canon, it was Frank Bryce who was murdered during that incident.
