Abraham was the first of the three Patriarchs of the Bible. According to the Biblical account, when Abraham was in Mesopotamia, God called on him to sacrifice his son, Isaac, in order to test his faith.
Abraham was mentioned in a book that was kept in the Restricted Section of the library at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by the 1990s.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the shrieking book, in which Abraham is mentioned, appears to be a copy of The Works of the Most Reverend Dr John Tillotson.
Richard Harris, who portrays Albus Dumbledore in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, played Abraham in the 1994 film Abraham.
