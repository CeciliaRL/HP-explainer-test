The only child and son of Charlus Potter and Dorea Black was a pure-blood wizard. He was a first cousin of Walburga, Alphard and Cygnus Black on his mother's side. He was also possibly related to James Potter and his son, Harry Potter, on his father's side.


== Behind the scenes ==
It was once speculated that James Potter was in fact Charlus Potter's son. However, the actual names of James's parents, Fleamont and Euphemia Potter, were revealed via  Pottermore. In spite of this, it is still more than likely that this individual might be a cousin of James Potter and his descendants.
Ironically, although it was not James, this man was related to many of those close to Harry Potter, for instance, being first and foremost an obvious relative on his father's side, a first cousin once removed of Sirius and Regulus Black and Bellatrix, Andromeda and Narcissa Black, and so a cousin of Nymphadora and Ted Lupin and Draco and Scorpius Malfoy respectively, a second cousin of Arthur Weasley, and a possible distant relative of Neville Longbottom.
If Harry really didn't have any living relatives other than the Dursleys by 1981, it can be assumed that Charlus, Dorea and their son were all dead by that date, although it is not fully confirmed.
This individual was not featured on the Potter family tree on Pottermore.
