Bran the Bloodthirsty was a Medieval Giant who lived in a castle on top of an enchanted beanstalk. He was fond of grinding up the bones of his victims to make his bread, and washing it down with the blood of an Englishman. He was eventually slain by a boy named Jack.
Long after his death, he appeared on a Chocolate Frog Card.


== Behind the scenes ==
Bran the Bloodthirsty is based on the giant from the popular fairy tale Jack and the Beanstalk.
In Welsh legend, Bran ("raven") the Blessed was a peaceful and wise giant who was King of Britain in the period between the departure of the Roman legions and the reign of King Arthur. When he was mortally wounded at the hands of Irish invaders, he ordered his followers to behead him and bury his head on Tower Hill, to protect Britain from invaders.
In Irish mythology, Bran is the talking hound of Fionn mac Cumhaill, known in English as Finn McCool, but she is not bloodthirsty. However, in another myth, Finn's son, Oisin, has lost immortality and meets St Patrick. To prove his words, he raises a hound and orders it should not see the light of day or taste blood. The hound (Bran Og) goes wild when exposed to sunlight and has to be killed. Both the giant and Bran Og were bloodthirsty.
