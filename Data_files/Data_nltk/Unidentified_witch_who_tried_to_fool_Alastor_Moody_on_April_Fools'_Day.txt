This witch once tried to fool Alastor Moody on April Fools' Day by shouting "Boo" behind him. Barty Crouch Jnr (disguised as Alastor Moody) told this story to Seamus Finnigan in 1994, which Ronald Weasley implied that it did not end well.


== Behind the scenes ==
As this witch was only mentioned in a story that the fake Alastor Moody related to a student, there exists the possibility that there was no such individual and the fake Moody only created this story as part of his cover.


== Appearances ==
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First mentioned)
