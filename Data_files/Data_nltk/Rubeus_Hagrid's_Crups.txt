These Crups were owned by Rubeus Hagrid in the 1980s.


== History ==


=== Adoption ===
Hagrid adopted these Crups from a friend whose Crup had a litter of puppies sometime prior to the start of the 1985–1986 school year at Hogwarts.


=== Case of the Missing Comet ===
During the 1985–1986 school year, these Crups were teething. They chewed up a Comet 220 broomstick which Skye Parkin had intended to give to Jacob's sibling, to allow her friend to play Quidditch on their own broom. Afterwards, Hagrid felt responsible, so he and Madam Hooch bought the student a Comet 260 broomstick to replace it.


=== Tricks exhibition ===
Before the Crups were sent to their final owners, Hagrid let several students care for and train them, and held a tricks exhibition to show their achievements. He intended to give one to Jacob's sibling, to allow them to take part, but then realized that they were all spoken for. However Jacob's sibling adopted their own crup and was able to take part, ultimately winning the competition.
