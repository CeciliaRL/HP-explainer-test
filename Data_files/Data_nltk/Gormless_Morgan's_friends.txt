These people were the friends of Gormless Morgan and written into The Rhyme of Gormless Morgan. They are most likely based on real people as most stories made by Miranda Goshawk were about real people who had their name changed to protect their identity. Morgan had been given a job by his boss to kill a fearsome Gorgon, a creature that could turn people into stone. They gave Morg the advice to have a plan first. Sadly, their friend was turned into stone.
