This Muggle betrayed James and Lily Potter when asked by Lord Voldemort to reveal their location of Godric's Hollow in October 1981.


== Behind the scenes ==
The muggle only appeared in an early and abandoned draft of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, portraying the role that was eventually given to Peter Pettigrew.
It is likely that the Muggle would have given their location willingly, as Rowling described them as a "horrible Muggle" who betrayed them in a similar way that Peter had, rather than someone who was made to by means of magic or threats.
Since Voldemort had hated Muggles and Muggle-borns, it is unknown why Rowling originally wanted a Muggle to betray the Potters for him. It is possible that they had no idea who he was, but just wanted to cause trouble, while Voldemort saw them as a means to his plan.
