The mother of Kevin went to the 1994 Quidditch World Cup with her husband and then two-year-old son, staying with them in a large, pyramid-shaped tent. Early in the morning, she came outside, and caught her young son using his father's wand to enlarge a slug. She scolded him, then inadvertently stepped on the slug, causing it to burst. This upset Kevin, and he yelled at her, "You bust slug! You bust slug!"


== Behind the scenes ==
Although it is never stated whether or not she was a witch, it can be assumed given that she went to the Quidditch World Cup when it was heavily protected with Muggle-Repelling Charms. Also, she seemed to know about the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.
