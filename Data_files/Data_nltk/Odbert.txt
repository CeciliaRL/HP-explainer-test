Odbert was a Goblin who worked at Gringotts Wizarding Bank at some point during 1990. Like most goblins, he was rather suspicious of most wizards, including the Hogwarts students that visited the bank looking for Bill Weasley. He did, however, appear quite friendly with his colleague and fellow goblin, Burgock.
