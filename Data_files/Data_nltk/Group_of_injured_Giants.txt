These three individuals were giants who served under Gurg Karkus in the Giant colony. One of them were able to understand human language and translated what Rubeus Hagrid and Olympe Maxime said to Karkus. When Golgomath killed Karkus and became the new Gurg, the group had to serve under him instead. When Hagrid and Maxime visited them, they wanted to kill the visitor, but when Hagrid talked to them, the translator-Giant translated to the other Giants. For the first few days, the three got along well with the two envoys, and two envoys visited other wounded, reckon six or seven of them convinced at one point. but when Golgomath ordered his subordinates to raid the caves for any traitors, due to siding with the Death Eaters, and decided to hunt down Hagrid and Maxime, the giants had no more loyalty to the Order of the Phoenix.
