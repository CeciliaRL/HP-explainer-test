This individual (fl. circa 993) was a wizard who lived during the Middle Ages and planned, designed and oversaw the construction of buildings of Hogwarts Castle, along with Founder Rowena Ravenclaw, who devised the ever-changing floorplan. 
There was a golden statue of this individual at Hogwarts Entrance Hall, in which he was shown among the four house mascots holding a model of Hogwarts on one of his hands, and charts and a set square in the other. The statue guarded a hidden passageway to the Founders' Tower.
