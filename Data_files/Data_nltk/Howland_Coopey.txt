Howland Coopey was a wizard who sent a letter to the Daily Prophet's advice column. He was sick and wanted to know if the symptoms he was experiencing — a green-and-purple rash between his toes and sparks coming out of his nostrils when he sneezed — were cause for concern. In his reply, Professor Spleen informed Coopey that he was suffering from a "simple case" of Dragon Pox. Oddly, despite Dragon Pox being potentially fatal, Professor Spleen does not recomned he go to St Mungo's, but rather to "immerse [his] nose continually in ice cold water."
