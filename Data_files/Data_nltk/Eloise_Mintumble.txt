Madam Eloise Mintumble (d. 1899) was a British witch and Unspeakable in the Department of Mysteries who died as a result of an experiment to travel back in time for more than a few hours.


== Biography ==
Madam Mintumble was trapped, for a period of five days, in the year 1402. When she was finally retrieved to the present, her body had aged five centuries, and, irreparably damaged, she died in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Her excursion to the past provoked a great disturbance to the life paths of all those she met, changing the present so dramatically that no fewer than twenty-five of their descendants vanished in the present, having been "un-born". Moreover, there were a few more alarming signs that time itself had been disturbed: Tuesday following her reappearance lasted two and a half days, whereas Thursday shot by in the space of four hours.
