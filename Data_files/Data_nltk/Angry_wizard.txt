This angry wizard had a portrait hung by the Grand Staircase at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


== Biography ==
When several students freed Gossamer from his portrait, he damaged the frame of the wizard's portrait and angered him. He talked to the students when they met and recalled how Gossamer had been locked away decades ago due to him being a nuisance. The students offered to fix the portrait frame, which they did after defeating some rats that came out of Argus Filch's tool chest.
