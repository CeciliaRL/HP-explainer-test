Lilith Molesby was a lovelorn British witch who wrote in to the Daily Prophet problem page and had her letter published in the 1 June 1999 issue.


== Biography ==
In the letter, Lilith sought advice on how to get a wizard to fall in love with her, reporting that this man had told her friends he would rather be "beaten to death by trolls than take her out for dinner." She asked whether giving the wizard a Love Potion could help resolve her dilemma. Her letter was answered by Grizel Hurtz, who advised her to start using Hate Potions instead, as this would be preferable to having to constantly "doctor" her beloved's drinks.
