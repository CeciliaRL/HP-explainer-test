Three Muggle boys who lived in the town of Mould-on-the-Wold during the 19th century bore witness to Ariana Dumbledore, a young witch who lived with her family nearby, performing Underage magic, which scared them into "trying to stop the little freak from doing it" by abusing her, after which point she was mentally traumatised, resulting in a lack of ability to control her magic. Ariana's father, Percival, went after the boys and attacked them, possibly through use of the Cruciatus Curse, which resulted in the Ministry of Magic sending him to Azkaban. Percival would not satisfactorily explain why he had done it, knowing that his daughter would be taken to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries for the rest of her life as a hazard to the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.


== Behind the scenes ==
In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, Muriel claimed that Percival had killed several Muggles, rather than just cursing them. However, she may have been exaggerating.
