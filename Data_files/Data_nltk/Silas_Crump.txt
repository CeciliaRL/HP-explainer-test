Silas Crump was a British wizard and petty criminal. 


== Biography ==
During his life as a criminal, he had been evading capture by Officer Cerberus Langarm from the British Ministry of Magic's Department of Magical Law Enforcement. This was due to the fact that he had never been caught red-handed.
Crump may have been in Slytherin House at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as there was a Slytherin scarf in his rented room at the Leaky Cauldron. His cunning and resourceful personality would also seem to support this. There was also a Chudley Cannons flag in his room, so he was most likely a supporter of them.
He owned a locked belt which was found in the London sewers. He would use this to restrain himself during the full moon as he was an unregistered Werewolf.
