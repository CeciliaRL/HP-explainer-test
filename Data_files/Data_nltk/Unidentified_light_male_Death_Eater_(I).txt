This Dark Wizard was a Death Eater and servant of Lord Voldemort who participated and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. During the early stages of the battle he was near the front of the group of Death Eaters who observed the protective enchantments placed around Hogwarts. He presumably fought in the Battle of Hogwarts where he was either killed or arrested and imprisoned in Azkaban, though he was possibly one of the Death Eaters who opted to flee once Harry Potter revealed himself to be alive.
