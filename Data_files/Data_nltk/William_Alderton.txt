William Alderton was allegedly the father of Alderton, a wizard who was tried for being a Muggle-born by the Muggle-Born Registration Commission during the height of the Second Wizarding War. Because the commission found Alderton guilty of this, it is likely that he was a Muggle. Despite this, his son claimed on leaving his trial that his father was a wizard. He also claimed that he once worked for the British Ministry of Magic for thirty years. Apparently, William Alderton always wore his jacket inside-out while working for the Ministry of Magic.
