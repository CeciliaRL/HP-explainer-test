Goliath was a mercenary giant employed by the Philistines to fight for them in the war they fought with the Israelites in Biblical times. He was ultimately slain by a young boy armed only with a catapult.


== Behind the scenes ==
Goliath is based on the Biblical figure of the same name. In the book 1 Samuel of the Old Testament, as a teenager, King David slew the giant Goliath, but the Chocolate Frog Card for Goliath only refers to the giant's slayer as a "young boy" and does not explicitly name David. It is thus possible that Goliath was not slain by David in the Harry Potter universe.
Giants in the Harry Potter universe are said to be between twenty and twenty five feet tall. According to a common interpretation of the Bible, Goliath was about 9 feet 9 inches, making him extremely short by giant standards (but still taller than the tallest recorded human), suggesting that he may have been a Half-giant. Other interpretations place his height at about 6 feet 7 inches, a more realistic height for a human who was still extremely tall by the standards of the time, making the term "Giant" descriptive.
Though David's weapon is sometimes depicted as a catapult, historically it was more likely to have been a sling weapon.
