There were two portraits of an eye, hanging at Hogwarts Castle. They were capable of speech, although the subject's mouth was not visible in the painting.


== History ==


=== 1993-1994 school year ===
By the 1993â€“1994 school year, both portraits were hung near the seventh-floor landing of the Grand Staircase. After the Fat Lady was attacked by Sirius Black in Hallowe'en, the eyeballs could be seen staring at the ruined portrait frame.


=== 1995-1997 ===
Appalled by the lack of view at the Grand Staircase, these portraits were moved by their own request to different locations: the Herbology corridor and the Transfiguration Courtyard. Both portraits were hung next to portraits of Timothy the Timid, to the latter's discomfort. Timothy was highly annoyed by the eyeballs' stare, and asked students to "cover him up", with paranoid claims that "he is one of them". Harry Potter, a fifth-year at the time, eventually obliged Timothy, covering the two portraits with both a bookcase (in the Transfiguration Courtyard) and a tapestry (in the Herbology Corridor).


== Behind the scenes ==
This portrait was identified as "Staring Portrait" in the credits of the video game version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. It was voiced in the game by David Robb.
