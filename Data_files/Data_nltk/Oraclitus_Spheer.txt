Oraclitus Spheer was a wizard. He had a portrait of himself hung in the Gryffindor Tower reading room, hiding Fred and George Weasley's convenience shop. His password was "Flibbertigibbet".


== Behind the scenes ==
Spheer may have passed away sometime prior to 1992, as many portraits hung at Hogwarts Castle depict deceased individuals.
In Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Sir Cadogan uses Flibbertigibbet as the password to Gryffindor Tower.
