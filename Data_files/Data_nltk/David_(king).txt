David was a king who ruled over Israel and Judah during ancient times. He was a prominent figure in the Bible, and was credited with writing many of the psalms contained in one of its books, the Book of Psalms. 
The Psalter, a volume incorporating the Book of Psalms and other devotional writings, was included in the Book of Common Prayer. A copy of the Book of Common Prayer was kept in the library at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the Bible, David slays the giant Goliath while still a boy, casting a stone at him with a sling. However, the Chocolate Frog Card for Goliath only refers to the giant's slayer as a "young boy," and does not explicitly name David. It is thus possible that Goliath was not slain by David in the Harry Potter universe.
