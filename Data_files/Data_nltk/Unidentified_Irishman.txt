This unnamed Irish man met Rubeus Hagrid in the Leaky Cauldron in 1990. He sold Hagrid the three-headed dog he owned. Hagrid named this dog Fluffy, and, the following year, lent him to Albus Dumbledore, who used him to guard the Philosopher's Stone.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the novel Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Hagrid states that he bought Fluffy from "a Greek man", rather than "an Irish feller,". Because of this change in the film, it loses J. K. Rowling's reference to Greek mythology, in which there was a three-head dog, Cerberus, that guarded the gates of Hades. However, Steve Kloves, the film's screenwriter, stated that he originally used "Greek chappie," but did not know how the line got changed.
