These twin boys appeared on Platform Nine and Three-Quarters in King's Cross on September 1, 2017 examining on their pet owl when the students were getting on the Hogwarts Express.


== Behind the scenes ==
They could be Lorcan and Lysander Scamander, Luna's kids, since they are blonde like her, but if they were, Luna would probably have been there too and then greeted Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny.
However, there is also possible that if they are indeed Lorcan and Lysander, it is possible that their they had arrived earlier and already had left, with their siblings already on the train.
