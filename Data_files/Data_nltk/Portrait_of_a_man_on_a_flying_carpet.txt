This individual was a wizard whose portrait hung at Hogwarts Castle in the 1990s, on the seventh-floor level of the Grand Staircase, above a portrait of three young ladies and next to a portrait of wailing Egyptians. He was depicted riding a flying carpet with a telescope, books and a seagull. He seemed to have befriended a portrait of a witch flying to the moon.
