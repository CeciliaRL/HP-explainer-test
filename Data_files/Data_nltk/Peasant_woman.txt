The peasant woman was a character in the tale The Wizard and the Hopping Pot by Beedle the Bard. She was described as "old" and had a granddaughter afflicted by a crop of warts. A kindly old wizard used to make a special poultice for her but when he died, his son rudely refused to give her the potion.
