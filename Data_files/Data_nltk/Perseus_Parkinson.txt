Minister Perseus Parkinson was British Minister for Magic from 1726 to 1733.


== Biography ==
He attempted to pass a bill making it illegal to marry a Muggle. However, in doing so, he misread the public mood; the wizarding public was tired of anti-Muggle sentiment and wanted peace. Parkinson was therefore voted out during the next election for Minister.
Perseus Parkinson's attempts to ban mixed marriages were identical to Rappaport's Law introduced by MACUSA president Emily Rappaport. However, unlike in the United States of America, anti-Muggle sentiments were not as widespread and confined to wizarding supremacists.
