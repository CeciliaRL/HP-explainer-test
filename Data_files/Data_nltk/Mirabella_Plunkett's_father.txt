Mr Plunkett was a man who lived during the 19th century.
He had at least one child, a witch daughter, Mirabella. During a holiday to Loch Lomond, his daughter fell in love with a merman, and wished to marry him. However, Mr Plunkett and his wife were deeply opposed, and forbade Mirabella to marry her merman lover. Mirabella transformed herself into a haddock and was never seen again.
