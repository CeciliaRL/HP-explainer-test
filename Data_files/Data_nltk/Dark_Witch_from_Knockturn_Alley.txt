The Dark Witch from Knockturn Alley was a high-ranking member of a dangerous organisation known as R.


== Biography ==


=== 1988–1989 school year ===
During the 1988–1989 school year, when Jacob's sibling and a friend visited Knockturn Alley, she prevented them from entering Borgin and Burkes and asked for a sacrifice. She duelled them and attracted more witches and wizards. However, Patricia Rakepick arrived in time and defeated them, including the witch.


=== 1989–1990 school year ===
During the 1989–1990 school year, she attended a secret meeting of R, which Jacob's sibling infiltrated impersonating Patricia Rakepick using Polyjuice Potion. When the real Rakepick Apparated onto the scene, she helped her fight Jacob's sibling's team.
At some point near the end of the school year, she was seen in the Hog's Head Inn and was unknowingly eavesdropped by Jacob's sibling and Mundungus Fletcher while talking about meeting someone later. In Knockturn Alley, she met Merula Snyde, who was ready to join R. Then she transformed into her original look and took Merula with her.


=== 1990–1991 school year ===
During the 1990–1991 school year, originally disguised as Wilkie Twycross, she revealed herself during a meeting with Zenith Xeep in Knockturn Alley and talked about Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution and the wand Zenith had stolen from Ollivanders. When Zenith was about to give her the wand, Ben Copper, who had been secretly watching with Jacob's sibling, interrupted them, and the Dark Witch used the Stunning Spell on him. When Jacob's sibling also emerged, she Disapparated.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Dark Arts: As a Dark Witch, she was highly proficient in dark magic. She was capable of performing the Slug-vomiting Charm proficiently.
Duelling: She was an excellent duellist, as she held her own against Nymphadora Tonks.
Apparition: She was able to Apparate at will.
Transfiguration: She was able to transform herself into a different look instantly, but the true nature of this transformation was unknown. It is possible that she was a Metamorphmagus (possibly the Metamorphmagus who infiltrated the Ministry in the 1990–1991 school year) who could change her appearance at will, or that she simply used advanced Human Transfiguration to change her appearance on sudden notice.
