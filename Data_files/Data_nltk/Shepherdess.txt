The Shepherdess was a portrait hung at Hogwarts Castle, on the Charms Staircase. She was depicted in a white dress, with her staff and with her flock behind her, in the background. She spoke in a strong West country accent.


== Behind the scenes ==
The Shepherdess is quite similar to a portrait of a girl with flowers featured in the film adaptations of Philosopher's Stone, Chamber of Secrets and Prisoner of Azkaban (portrayed by Violet Columbus).
This individual may have died sometime prior to 1995, as many portraits hung at Hogwarts Castle depict deceased individuals.
She is voiced by Eleanor Hans.
When she declared that Google Stump is 'a portrait with answers,' she made a reference to the web search engine Google, which is primary online tool used to look for information.
