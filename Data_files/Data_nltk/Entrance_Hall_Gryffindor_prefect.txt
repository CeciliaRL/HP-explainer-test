This wizard (c. 1975-1976) attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was Sorted into Gryffindor House, with Minerva McGonagall as his Head of House, and became a prefect in his fifth year. He often stood in the Entrance Hall near the front door, and told any who came what the house point totals were.


== Behind the scenes ==
For him to have been a Gryffindor Prefect for Harry's first three years at Hogwarts, this would seem to put him in the same year as Percy Weasley, who was also a Gryffindor Prefect. As only one Prefect is chosen per gender per House per year, this creates a discrepancy. It is possible that he may have been held back a year for some reason, like Marcus Flint.
