Mirabella Plunkett (b. 1839) was a British witch famous for falling in love with a merman in Loch Lomond while on holiday. After her parents forbade her to marry him, she transfigured herself into a haddock and was never seen again. She was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card and on a portrait hung at Hogwarts Castle.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Mirabella Plunkett was born in 1839 to Mr and Mrs Plunkett. Nothing about her background or education is known.


=== Finding love ===
At some point in her life, Mirabella travelled to Loch Lomond on holiday, where she met and fell in love with a merman.
Mirabella and the merman decided to marry. However, Mirabella's parents objected strongly, and forbade her to marry him. In response, Mirabella transfigured herself into a haddock, never to be seen again. It is unknown if she ever returned to her merman lover once she became a haddock.


=== Legacy ===
After her disappearance, Mirabella was not forgotten. She was eventually immortalised on a Chocolate Frog Card. There was also a portrait of her hung at Hogwarts Castle, which guarded a secret shortcut between the first-floor landing of the Grand Staircase and the Entrance Hall side room. The password required to gain access to said shortcut was haddock.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Transfiguration: Mirabella was highly proficient in the art of transfiguration, given how she successfully transfigured herself into a haddock fish; a famous achievement in the field which gained her recognition on a Chocolate Frog Card. Given how both Human Transfiguration and Trans-Species Transformation are incredibly complex and advanced branches of transfiguration, this shows her remarkable talent she possessed in this notably very difficult branch of magic.
Love: Mirabella was an incredibly loving soul, who famously fell in love with a Merman and even went to the drastic measures of transfiguring herself into a haddock, just so she could be with her lover in the water together as fish, showing her love to have been very strong and powerful indeed.


== Etymology ==
The name "Mirabella" is derived from Latin mirabilis, "wonderful".
