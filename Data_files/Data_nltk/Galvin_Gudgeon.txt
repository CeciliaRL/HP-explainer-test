Galvin Gudgeon was a wizard who was the Seeker for the Chudley Cannons Quidditch team in the 1990s. Whilst playing in a match against the Tutshill Tornados, Gudgeon fell off his Broomstick trying to catch a passing bumble-bee.
In 1998 he performed terribly when the Cannons were defeated by the Appleby Arrows. During the game, the Snitch bounced off his nose twice. Cannons manager Ragmar Dorkins felt he had to tell the team's fans that "turning him into a toad will not help his game."
