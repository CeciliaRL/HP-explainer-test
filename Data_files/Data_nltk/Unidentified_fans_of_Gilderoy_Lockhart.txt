These individuals were fans of Gilderoy Lockhart. They lived in a quaint suburban house in the wilds of Essex with a small Horklump-infested yard. They were known to brew Celery and Beetroot Wine at their home.
In Marauding with Monsters, Gilderoy Lockhart wrote of the sojourn he spent in these fans' house. He claimed to have rid his fans' yard of Horklumps. The veracity of these claims is doubtful, as Lockhart was known to have regularly taken credit for other people's achievements.
