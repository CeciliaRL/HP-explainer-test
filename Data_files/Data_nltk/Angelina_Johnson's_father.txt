Mr Johnson was the father of Angelina Johnson. 


== History ==
In July 2014, shortly before the final of the 2014 Quidditch World Cup, he fell ill, and Angelina left her marital home to care for him. This sparked several rumours that Angelina had walked out on her husband, George Weasley, because she had "grown restless" in their marriage.
