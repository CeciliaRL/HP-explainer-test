Zaccaria Innocenti (fl. 79 AD) was an ancient Roman warlock who lived during the 1st century AD. 


== Biography ==
He misused the Dancing Feet Spell in 79 AD, conjuring a 'dance' within Mt. Vesuvius, resulting in its eruption, which destroyed the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum, killing at least 1500 people. His improper usage of the spell is what he and the spell is most remembered for. Whether or not he was one of the eruption's casualties is unknown. 


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Charms: Zaccaria was proficient with the casting of the Dancing Feet Spell, that inadvertently triggered the explosion of Mount Vesuvius which killed at least 1500 people.


== Etymology ==
"Zaccaria" is the Italian form of Zechariah, a Hebrew name meaning "God remembers", while Innocenti is an Italian surname that derives from the Italian word for "innocent" (innocente). Neither is consistent with the naming conventions of ancient Rome, but this may be explained as wizarding names not necessarily adhering to non-magical naming conventions.
