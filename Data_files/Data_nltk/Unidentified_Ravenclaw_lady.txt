== Biography ==


=== 1991–1992 school year ===
In Harry Potter's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she was guarding a secret room in the Dungeons, concealing a Quidditch Armour. The password required to gain entrance was "Wanglewort".


=== 1992–1993 school year ===
A year later, her portrait had been moved, and now guarded the way to the Ravenclaw Duelling Arena.


== Personality and traits ==
This witch was proud of her House and considered others who dare duel the Ravenclaw Duelling Champion to be "foolish". However, in 1991 she became very nervous as she sensed there was someone in the castle doing something evil, showing she was rather observant and intuitive.

This witch may have passed away sometime prior to 1991, as many portraits hung at Hogwarts Castle depict deceased individuals.
