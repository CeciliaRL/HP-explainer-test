Ekrizdis was a 15th-century Dark Wizard who was the original inhabitant of the fortress of Azkaban.


== Biography ==
Alone on Azkaban's island, which was at the time uncharted by both Muggles and wizardkind, Ekrizdis practised the worst kinds of Dark Magic. He would often lure passing Muggle sailors to his fortress only to torture and murder them. He was believed to have lost his sanity during his years of solitude. After Ekrizdis's death, the Concealment Charms he placed on the fortress and island faded, and the British Ministry of Magic, suddenly aware of the island's existence, investigated. Other than the fact that the building was infested with Dementors, investigators refused to discuss what other evidence of Ekrizdis's activities they found within Azkaban.
