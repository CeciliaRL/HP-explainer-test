== Biography ==
Bridget Wenlock once thought she had mistakenly sent an envelope (on which she thought she had scribbled the theorem that led to her discovery of the magical properties of the number seven in Invisible Ink) to her cousin. After chasing the owl that brought the letter and after casting a Revealing Charm, Wenlock found out that the envelope contained no more than a cake recipe, and that she had, in fact, scrawled her calculation on a sugar packet that she had left at home.
