== Biography ==


=== Meeting at Malfoy Manor ===
This Death Eater was present at the meeting at Malfoy Manor in July 1997, where she, along with all the other Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort himself, plotted and discussed important matters. She also witnessed the murder of the kidnapped Charity Burbage by Lord Voldemort, where she appeared to be disturbed by Nagini's slivering across the dining table to devour her corpse.


=== Battle of Hogwarts ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			The female Death Eater at the Battle of Hogwarts 		 	 
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			She is behind Lucius Malfoy, about to Disapparate 		 	 
This Death Eater later participated in the Battle of Hogwarts. While in the Forbidden Forest, she was seen holding Hagrid down with ropes alongside several other Death Eaters. She witnessed the believed death of Harry Potter by the hand of Voldemort. When Voldemort and the Death Eater have returned to Hogwarts via the viaduct, she was standing near the Malfoys. Like some other Death Eaters she is seen Disapparating and fled the castle as Harry Potter proved he was not in fact dead and the battle continued. It is unknown if she later survived after Voldemort's final defeat. But if she did, she was later imprisoned in Azkaban afterwards.


== Personality and traits ==
Judging by her decision to flee once she saw that Harry Potter was alive, she seemed to be one of the less loyal and cowardly of the Death Eaters. She was also shown to be rather frightened and unnerved when Nagini slithered across the table to devour the corpse of Charity Burbage, further showing her cowardice.
