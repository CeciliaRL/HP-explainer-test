Quentin Kowalski was an American wizard who played as a Chaser for the 2014 American National Quidditch team. During the fourth match of the 427th Quidditch World Cup, US versus Jamaica, Kowalski scored the ninth and final US goal.


== Biography ==
Just before Kowalski scored the goal, however, Jamaican Keeper Kquewanda Bailey unexpectedly toppled unconscious from her broomstick. The convenient timing of Bailey's unconsciousness aroused suspicion of foul play, but the ICWQC later confirmed that Bailey was suffering from an infected Sasabonsam bite, sustained during the disastrous World Cup opening ceremony.


== Behind the scenes ==
He may be a descendant of Queenie Goldstein and Jacob Kowalski. Their marriage would have been in violation of Rappaport's Law in the 1920s, but they could have left the country to marry or been married secretly. The law was repealed in 1965, after which Queenie and Jacob would have been free to live openly in the United States of America as husband and wife with their descendants.
