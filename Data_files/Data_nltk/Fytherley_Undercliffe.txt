Professor Fytherley Undercliffe was a wizard and a Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the sixteenth century.
Undercliffe had a portrait that was painted in 1531. It was hung in the Headmaster's Office at Hogwarts after his death.


== Behind the scenes ==
The portrait seems to be a direct reference to an 1877 portrait of an Orthodox protodeacon holding a walking stick, by Ilya Yefimovich Repin. The same portrait appears at the Grand Staircase in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film) when the Fat Lady is missing.
On the DVD of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (film), Professor Undercliffe's portrait is erroneously referred to as a portrait of "Salazar Slytherin himself". Why this mistake was made is, as of yet, unclear.
The inscription on Professor Fytherley Undercliffe's portrait frame, "Virtutes, Archangeli, Angeli, Principatus, Dominationes, Seraphin, Cherubin, Throni" are all names of eight hosts of angels.
