Caelan MacBoon was a wizard and Quintius MacBoon's nephew. According to legend, Quintius killed the head of the McClivert clan, Dugald McClivert in a drunken duel. The death led to the McClivert clan transfiguring the MacBoons into extremely dangerous flesh-eating beasts known as Quintapeds, presumably including Caelan.
