The McGonagalls' cat was a pet of the McGonagall family. Isobel McGonagall learned her daughter Minerva was a witch when she started displaying small, but unmistakable, signs of magic, such as the cat doing the infant's bidding before she could even talk.
It is interesting to note that Minerva McGonagall had an affinity with cats since she was an infant; in her adulthood, both Minerva's Patronus and Animagus form was that of a cat.
