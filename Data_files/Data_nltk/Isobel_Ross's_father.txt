Mr Ross was a Scottish wizard and he and his wife, a witch, had at least one child, Isobel.
When Isobel became romantically involved with a Muggle neighbour, Robert McGonagall, she knew her parents would not approve, and thus she chose not to tell them of the relationship. Eventually, the young couple eloped, provoking the Ross' anger to the point they completely severed ties with their daughter.
