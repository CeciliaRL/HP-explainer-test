Heliotrope Willis was a British witch who lead the activist group Troll Rights Movement. She claimed trolls had a non-violent nature and made excellent guards, but, ironically, when her group crashed an anti-troll rally, she was knocked unconscious by indiscriminate club-swinging of the trolls present.


== Etymology ==
Heliotrope is a term used to describe a plant which turns to face the sun, derived from the Greek helios, "sun", and tropein, "to turn." In the language of flowers, heliotropes represent devotion. Miss Heliotrope is a character in The Little White Horse, a 1946 novel by Elizabeth Goudge, which was a childhood favourite of J. K. Rowling.
The surname Willis is derived from the given name William, which means "will helmet", from the Germanic elements wil, "will," and helm, "helmet."
