Zamira Gulch was a British witch the author of Practical Household Magic. She also wrote for the Daily Prophet's advice column, giving readers who wrote in tips on how to solve common magical problems, while Grizel Hurtz, Helbert Spleen, and Dempster Wiggleswade fielded other topics. In one issue, she responded to a letter from Elveira Elkins, who was having difficulty getting a Fixing Charm to work. Gulch concluded that Elkins let her mind wander too much when casting the spell and should probably just stick to using nails instead.
