If this individual's name is indication of anything, he is probably Greek or of Greek descent — the name "Georgios" is the Greek form of George.
The surname Xenakis is also Greek, from ξένος ['ksenos] ("stranger", "foreigner", but also "friend from far away"). Greek artist Constantin Xenakis (born 1931), Greek composer and architect Iannis Xenakis (1922–2001), and Greek gymnast Thomas Xenakis (1875–1942) are some notable people who bore this surname.
