The only son of Caspar Crouch and Charis Black was a pure-blood wizard. He had two sisters.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is possible that Caspar Crouch's son was Bartemius Crouch Snr, who is described as an "elderly man" at the 1994 Quidditch World Cup. This is supported by the fact that he and his son were the last of their family. However, his mother Charis was born in 1919, so, assuming she had her son after reaching the age of majority, the earliest he could have been born was 1936. This would make it unlikely that he would be described as "elderly" in 1994. But Rowling wrote all but the first chapter of Goblet of Fire in the third-person limited point-of-view, which means that the description of Crouch as "elderly" actually represents Harry Potter's perception. A 58-year-old man might appear "elderly" to a 14-year-old boy, and it is also quite plausible that the tribulations Crouch went through during the First Wizarding War would have prematurely aged him. Also, terms like "elderly" can be loosely used, without kind of mathematical rigour, especially by young people; for instance, Walburga Black in her portrait was described as "old", despite not being more than sixty years old when the portrait was made. It should be noted, however, that two people featured on the Black family tree become fathers at the age of thirteen; whether that was a mathematical mistake on Rowling's part or not is unclear, but Charis and her son might have been intended to be older than they appear to be.
If Caspar Crouch's son is Barty Crouch Snr, then, through the Black family, Barty Crouch and Arthur Weasley are first cousins (both sharing Arcturus Black and Lysandra Yaxley as maternal grandparents) and, by extension, Crouch's personal assistant Percy Weasley is his first cousin once removed. This relationship, if true, is not mentioned at all in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
