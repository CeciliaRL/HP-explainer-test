Alistair Ballcocke was a wizard whose name was carved into a wood panel on the wall of Professor Trelawney's Divination classroom.


== Etymology ==
Ballcocke is an alternate spelling of the English surname Balcock, which derives from the diminutive suffix -cock combined with either Bald, a pet form of the Germanic male given name Baldwin, or the Old English beald ("brave," "bold").
A ballcock is a mechanism for filling water tanks (such as in flush toilets) designed to prevent overflow and backflow.
Alistair is the anglicised form of Alasdair. Alasdair is the Scottish form of Alexander, which means "defending men".


== Behind the scenes ==
This character was presumably named after Alastair Bullock, the assistant art director on the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
