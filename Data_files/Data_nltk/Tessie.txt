Tessie was a great-aunt of the children of Arthur and Molly Weasley. In December of 1994, Ron Weasley commented that his dress robes for the Yule Ball made him look and smell like her. She may have owned Shell Cottage before Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour.


== Behind the scenes ==

In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Draco Malfoy remarked on the fashionability of Ronald Weasley's dress robes. If the remark is to be trusted, Tessie could presumably be born in the late 19th century.
Interestingly, another Weasley relation named Muriel was born in 1890. It was thought that she was a great-aunt of the Weasley children too and based on the approximate ages of Muriel and Tessie and their similar relation to the Weasley family, they might have been sisters. However,  Pottermore determined that Muriel was actually the great-great aunt of the Weasley children which makes Muriel more likely to be her aunt.
