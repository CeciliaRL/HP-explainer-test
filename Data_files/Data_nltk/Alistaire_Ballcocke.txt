Alistaire Ballcocke was a wizard who appeared on the Marauder's Map in the winter of 1993.


== Etymology ==
Ballcocke is an alternate spelling of the English surname Balcock, which derives from the diminutive suffix -cock combined with either Bald, a pet form of the Germanic male given name Baldwin, or the Old English beald ("brave," "bold"). 
A ballcock is a mechanism for filling water tanks (such as in flush toilets) designed to prevent overflow and backflow.
