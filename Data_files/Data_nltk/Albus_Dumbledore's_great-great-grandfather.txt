Mr Dumbledore was an individual that once owned a phoenix, but it took flight when he died and never returned. He was an example of a story in the Dumbledore family that a phoenix would come to any Dumbledore who is in desperate need.


== Behind the scenes ==
Considering the immense lifespan of Phoenixes, it is possible that there is in fact only one Phoenix, Fawkes, that follows different members of the Dumbledore family, though J. K. Rowling has said that Fawkes had not served another human before Albus Dumbledore.
