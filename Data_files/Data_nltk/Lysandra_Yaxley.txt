Lysandra Black (n√©e Yaxley) (fl. 1915-1919) was a pure-blood witch who married Arcturus Black II. The couple had three children together: Callidora, Cedrella, and Charis Black. Through Cedrella, who was disowned for marrying "blood traitor" Septimus Weasley, she is the maternal grandmother of Arthur Weasley. Lysandra may be related to the Death Eater Corban Yaxley, and, through her daughters, the Longbottom and Crouch families.
