== Biography ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Mr Goldstein, dancing with her wife and daugthers 		 	 
Sometime in his daughters' childhood, the Goldstein family danced together while dressed up.
He and his wife died of Dragon Pox when their daughters were young. This left the girls to "raise each other," which lead them to forge a life-long bond.
After being sentenced to death in 1926, Tina Goldstein had her happy memories extracted from her head by Bernadette, who then cast them into the death potion in the Death Cell. To keep Tina sedated, the potion replayed the memories for her, which included "happy images" of her mother and father.
