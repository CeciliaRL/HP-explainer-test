Rosa Karasu was a witch who was known for her exceptional culinary skills.


== Biography ==
During the 1988â€“1989 school year, Mary and Rosa Karasu visited Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to hold a cook-off for students. They announced the event in the Great Hall where the students and faculty were gathered. As they were grandmothers of Tulip, a friend of Jacob's sibling, they were personally introduced to the latter by her, and greeted them affectionately.
They were the judges of the Great Hogwarts Cook-Off. When the contestants finished their dishes, Mary and Rosa offered some constructive criticism to every one of them, but inadvertently angered Ismelda Murk by calling her dough "sad and soggy", who transformed her meat pie into a monster, which destroyed Diego Caplan's flan and overall made a mess.
The event had become a disaster, but Mary and Rosa were later approached by Jacob's sibling and Tulip with the idea that it could be turned into a collaboration between the contestants, who would share their ingredients to perfect all the dishes. They heartily agreed to it. Later, they attended the feast and commended on the final outcome. They had also decided to award Jacob's sibling for their significant part in organising and changing the course of the event.


== Behind the scenes ==
The game isn't clear as to what the exact relationship is among Mary, Rosa and Tulip. Some speculate that Mary and Rosa are a couple based on their shared surname and both of them being Tulip's grandmother. They might also simply be sisters-in-law with the same surname. A twitter feed from the Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery official account states that Mary and Rosa are Tulip's "aunts", but this is likely a mistake, as the dialogues in the game make it very clear that Tulip is their granddaughter.
