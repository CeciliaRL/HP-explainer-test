This saleswoman was a British witch and the proprietor of Magical Menagerie, which is one of two major pet shops in Diagon Alley.


== Biography ==
In 1991, she was willing to give Harry Potter some warts from a Giant Purple Toad if he could catch it. In 1992, she was absent, possibly on vacation, and a man had to do her job. She advised a customer on how to take care of a double-ended newt, sold Ron Weasley a bottle of rat tonic for Scabbers during the summer of 1993, and sold Crookshanks to Hermione Granger at that time as well.


== Behind the scenes ==
The Magical Menagerie saleswoman is omitted from the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, since Hermione already has Crookshanks with her by the time Harry was reunited with her and Ron.
