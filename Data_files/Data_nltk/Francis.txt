== Biography ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Horace Slughorn, Francis' owner 		 	 
It was originally a lily petal which Lily Evans had transfigured into piscine form during her studying years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
The fish came into Slughorn's possession when Lily set the petal to float inside a bowl filled with water. When Slughorn found his gift, the petal sank down in the bowl and turned into Francis, much to the Professor's delight. Slughorn kept Francis for many years, until the morning of 1 November, 1981, when he found Francis had disappeared. This was due to Lily's death at the hands of Lord Voldemort.
