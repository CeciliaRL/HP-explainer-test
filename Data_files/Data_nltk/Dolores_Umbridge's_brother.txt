Mr Umbridge was a Squib, son of wizard Orford Umbridge and Muggle Ellen Cracknell.


== Biography ==
Umbridge was born in 1973 or earlier to the wizard Orford Umbridge and Muggle Ellen Cracknell, and had an older sister named Dolores. His status as a Squib would often lead his father and sister to blame his mother for being the cause of it, which led the family to be fraught with tensions. When Dolores was fifteen years old, his parents separated and he would return to the Muggle world with his mother, while his sister would stay with his father in the wizarding world and would never speak of him again.
