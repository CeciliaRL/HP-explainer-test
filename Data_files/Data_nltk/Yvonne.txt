== Biography ==
On 23 June 1991, Vernon Dursley considered her as a replacement babysitter for Harry Potter when Arabella Figg broke her leg. Unfortunately for the Dursleys, she was on holiday in Majorca at the time (which Petunia bluntly reminded Vernon of), and they were forced to take Harry to the Zoo on Dudley Dursley's eleventh birthday.
