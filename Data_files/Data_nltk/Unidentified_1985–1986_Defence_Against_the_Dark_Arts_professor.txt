This individual was a wizard who became the professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the 1985â€“1986 school year. However, because of Lord Voldemort's jinx on the post, this individual needed to be replaced by the end of the year.
When Bill Weasley proceeded to teach Jacob's sibling the Fire-Making Spell, he implied that the spell should have been taught in Defence Against the Dark Arts, but assumed Jacob's sibling had not learned it in the class, for the professor was hardly around or teaching, which Jacob's sibling concurred. According to his students, he was rarely present, making it difficult for them to learn from him.
