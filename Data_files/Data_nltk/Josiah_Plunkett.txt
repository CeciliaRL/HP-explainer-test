Josiah Plunkett was a Quidditch referee. He oversaw the match between the Appleby Arrows and the Pride of Portree during which Dougal McBride, the Seeker for the Pride of Portree, turned the head of the Arrows Seeker, Gregory Cotton, into a cabbage. McBride defended his actions to Plunkett by claiming that Cotton had hit him with a Jelly-Fingers Curse while they were both racing towards the Snitch and thus deserved to be "cabbaged."
