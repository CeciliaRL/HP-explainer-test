Isaac was the second of the three Patriarchs of the Bible. He was the son of Abraham, who, in a well-known Biblical account, was called upon by God to offer him as sacrifice in order to test his faith.
Isaac was mentioned in a book that was kept in the Restricted Section of the library at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by the 1990s.

In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the shrieking book, in which Isaac is mentioned, appears to be a copy of The Works of the Most Reverend Dr John Tillotson.
