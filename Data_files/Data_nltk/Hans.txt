Hans was a male Augurey and the team mascot for the Liechtenstein National Quidditch team, who even had his own fan club.


== Biography ==
During the celebrations following the quarter-final match of the 2014 Quidditch World Cup, in which the USA defeated Liechtenstein on 8 June, 2014, Hans was reported to have been kidnapped by celebrating American fans. Liechtenstein coach and manager Ferdinand JÃ¤gendorf issued the following statement: "Das finden wir nicht lustig" ("we don't find that funny").
He was returned the following day after an exchange of terse owls between Liechtenstein Minister for Magic Otto Obermeier and President of MACUSA Samuel G. Quahog, although magizoologists had to keep him under close observation for ill effects.
