Lucas Bargeworthy was an English wizard who played as a Beater for the English National Quidditch team during the late 19th century. In August 1877, he woke up along with the rest of the wizarding world with no memory of the Quidditch World Cup that was supposed to have taken place that year, although he was mysteriously missing most of his teeth.
