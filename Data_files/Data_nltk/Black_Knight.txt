The Black Knight was a ghost at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


== Behind the scenes ==
The Black Knight was one of the original ghosts created by J. K. Rowling but did not survive final edits.
Though the Black Knight is never mentioned by name in any of the novels, it is possible that the knight with an arrow sticking out of his forehead that attended Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth Deathday Party was intended to be this character.
