Herbert Chorley was a Muggle Junior minister in 1996. He was placed under a botched Imperius Curse, leaving him acting like a duck. Ministry of Magic officials placed him in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries for treatment. It was stated that he nearly strangled three of the healers, and therefore had to be removed from Muggle society for a while. It is unknown if he ever recovered.
