Balfour Blane (1566 â€“ 1629) was a British wizard who established the Committee on Experimental Charms. For this accomplishment, he was commemorated on a bronze Chocolate Frog Card.


== Behind the scenes ==
Given that  Pottermore revealed that the Ministry of Magic was formally established in 1707 (78 years after Balfour Blane's death), it follows that the Committee on Experimental Charms must predate the Ministry itself, possibly having started out as part of the Wizards' Council.


== Etymology ==
The name "Balfour" is from a Scottish surname, originally from various place names, which meant "village pasture" in Gaelic.
