This "clever goblin" worked at Gringotts Wizarding Bank during the wizard management in 1997-1998, after the Ministry of Magic fell to the Death Eaters.
He was present at the bank when Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley and Griphook hosted a break-in in order to retrieve one of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes, Helga Hufflepuff's Cup, from the Lestrange Vault.
It is unknown what happened to the goblin after the break-in, but he may have been killed.
