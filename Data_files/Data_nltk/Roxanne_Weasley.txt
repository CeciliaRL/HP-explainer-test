Roxanne Weasley (b. 2000s) was the daughter of George Weasley and Angelina Weasley (n√©e Johnson). She had an older brother, Fred, who was named after her late uncle. She may have shared her parents' love of Quidditch, playing as either a Beater or a Chaser.


== Etymology ==
Roxanne is an English spelling of the French name Roxane, which in turn comes from the Greek name Roxana, derived from the Persian Roshanak, meaning "bright" or "dawn". Roxana was the name of Alexander the Great's first wife. Also, Roxanne is the name of a main character in Edmond Rostand's play Cyrano de Bergerac, who is the love interest of the eponymous hero.
