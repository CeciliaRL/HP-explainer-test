This individual worked as secretary to the Minister for Magic, Faris Spavin, in the late 19th century.


== Biography ==
In the late 19th century, the Muggle government made plans to flatten the Leaky Cauldron, with the creation of Charing Cross Road. Faris Spavin made a melancholy seven-hour speech before the Wizengamot explaining why the Leaky Cauldron could not be saved. During the course of his tedious speech, however, the wizarding community rallied and performed a mass of Memory Charms (some say, although it has never been conclusively proven, that the Imperius Curse was additionally used on several Muggle town planners), so that the Leaky Cauldron was now accommodated in the revised plans for the new road. As soon as Spavin sat down after concluding his seven-hour speech, his secretary presented him with a note describing the developments that had just invalidated his words.
