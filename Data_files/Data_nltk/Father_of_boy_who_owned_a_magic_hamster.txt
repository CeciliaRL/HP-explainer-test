This individual was a wizard who lived in the British Isles. He later got married to a witch and in c. 1980 he had a son. They were presumably very poor as they saved on the light bill by using the Wand-Lighting Charm, Lumos, to save Galleons to be able to afford their son's trip to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
