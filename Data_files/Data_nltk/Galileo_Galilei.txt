Galileo Galilei (15 February 1564 â€“ 8 January 1642) was an Italian Muggle astronomer, physicist, and engineer. He was famous for his improvements to the telescope and for the role he played in making heliocentrism (the concept that the Earth and other planets revolve around the Sun) the widely-accepted scientific model.
The work of Galileo was among the many topics covered in the book A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking.
