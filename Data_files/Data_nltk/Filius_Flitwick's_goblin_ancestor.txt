An ancestor of Professor Flitwick, the Charms Master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, was a goblin. Although Professor Flitwick was several generations removed from this individual, he still retained some goblin traits, notably a small stature.


== Behind the scenes ==
J. K. Rowling revealed on her website that Flitwick had a "dash" of goblin blood, suggesting only that his goblin ancestor would have been "something like a great, great, great grandfather." It remains unknown exactly how far back the goblin ancestor was on Flitwick's family tree or which of Flitwick's parents carried the ancestry.
