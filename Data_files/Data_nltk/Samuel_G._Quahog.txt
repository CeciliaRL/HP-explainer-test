== Biography ==
Following the American victory over Liechtenstein on the quarter-finals of the 2014 Quidditch World Cup, the Liechtenstein mascot, a large and gloomy Augurey called Hans, was kidnapped by high-spirited American fans celebrating their team's historic triumph. Hans was put back in his customised pen the following day, 9 June 2014, but not before negotiations for his return reached the highest levels: the Liechtenstein Minister for Magic Otto Obermeier and President Samuel G. Quahog had to exchange terse owls so that the bird was returned home. Even though President Quahog termed it was done in a "friendly and cooperative fashion", Minister Obermeier insisted that if any ill effects were discovered on Hans, Liechtenstein would "of course lobby the ICWQC for the USA's immediate disqualification from the World Cup".
