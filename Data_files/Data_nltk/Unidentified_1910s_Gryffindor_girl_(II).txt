Sometime during the 1910s, whilst attending Hogwarts, she and her friend spitefully gossiped about Leta Lestrange about being an unwanted child and for the death of her half-brother, before she herself was hit with the dark charm Oscausi by Leta out of retaliation, sealing her mouth shut. Once she reported Leta Lestrange to Professor Minerva McGonagall, once having her mouth opened by her, she began to speak nastily of Lestrange, but her mouth was quickly re-sealed by the no-nonsense teacher to shut her up properly.
