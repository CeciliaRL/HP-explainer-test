This female Chimaera was owned by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn during the 1980s.


== Biography ==
Professor Silvanus Kettleburn brought this Chimaera from Greece to the Hogwarts grounds in the summer of 1987.
During the 1987â€“1988 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Professor Silvanus Kettleburn repeatedly said that his Chimaera had escaped and was roaming the castle unleashed. The Chimaera was still loose at the beginning of the following school year. Jacob's sibling found her in the Forbidden Forest, but was unable to subdue her with magic. Liz Tuttle managed to calm her down.
Later during the same school year, Jacob's sibling battled this Chimaera again to impress Peeves. Kettleburn arrived with Liz and Barnaby before Jacob's sibling lost control.
