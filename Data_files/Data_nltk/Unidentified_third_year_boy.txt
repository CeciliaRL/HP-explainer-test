== Biography ==
This wizard started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1982 and was sorted in the same house as Jacob, a student who was expelled while looking for the Cursed Vaults. The boy disliked Jacob to the extent that he considered him to have ruined their house's reputation.
In his third year, the younger sibling of Jacob got sorted into the same house as him. Shortly after the Sorting ceremony, he confronted Jacob's sibling in their common room and expressed his dislike towards the sibling being in the same house as him. Rowan Khanna defended them. The boy then left, telling the two he would keep an eye on them.
