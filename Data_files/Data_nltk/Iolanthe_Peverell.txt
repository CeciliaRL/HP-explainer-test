Iolanthe Potter (n√©e Peverell) was an English witch and the granddaughter of Ignotus Peverell. 


== Biography ==
Described as "beautiful", she lived in Godric's Hollow. Due to the lack of male heirs, she, the eldest of her generation, inherited her grandfather's Cloak of Invisibility. Upon her marriage to Hardwin Potter, she explained that, in the tradition of the Peverell family, possession of the cloak was kept secret. Hardwin honoured her family's tradition, and, from then on, the cloak was passed to the eldest child of each new generation in the Potter family.
Henry Potter, a member of the Wizengamot from 1913 to 1921 and the great-grandfather of Harry Potter, was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe.
