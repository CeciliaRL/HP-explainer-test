Cantankerus Nott (fl. 1930s) was a wizard and a member of the pure-blood Nott family. He was widely believed to have been the one who penned the Pure-Blood Directory. This book listed the "twenty-eight truly pure-blood families", with "the aim of helping such families maintain the purity of their bloodlines". The book was also published anonymously in Britain in the early 1930s.


== Etymology ==
"Cantankerous" is a word meaning ill-tempered, surly, argumentative, and uncooperative.


== Behind the scenes ==
He was most likely related to Theodore Nott as well as his father. It is also possible that he was Theodore's father or grandfather.
Some of the families presented in his apparent directory weren't as pure-blooded as he claimed, such as the Ollivander family. Also many pure-blooded families such as the Potters, the Crabbes and the Goyles were not listed, in fact many pure-blood supremacists were angered by their lack of inclusion. Due to this, if he was the one behind the Pure-Blood Directory, Cantankerus Nott seems to have been a highly biased individual.
