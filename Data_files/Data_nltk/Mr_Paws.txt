Mr Paws was one of Mrs Figg's part-Kneazles. The other three were Mr Tibbles, Snowy and Tufty. Harry Potter saw it (or possibly its picture) when he went to stay with Mrs Figg when Dudley got to go to places on his birthday. Harry found a hard time being remorseful when Mrs Figg broke her leg after reminding himself that it would be a while before he had to see Mr Tibbles, Snowy, Tufty and Mr Paws again.
