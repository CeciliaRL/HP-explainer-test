Sir Herbert Varney (1858â€“1889) was a short-lived British vampire who preyed upon London women in the 1880s. He was eventually caught and killed by a specially-assigned group of wizards from the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. He appears on a Famous Wizard Card.


== Behind the scenes ==
This character probably references Varney the Vampire or the Feast of Blood, a Gothic horror story written by James Malcolm Rymer in the 19th century, and one of the first vampire novels ever written (predating and influencing Bram Stoker's more popular Dracula).
Herbert Varney may have also been loosely based on the unidentified serial killer Jack the Ripper, who in 1888 brutally murdered at least five women in London, but was never caught or identified.
