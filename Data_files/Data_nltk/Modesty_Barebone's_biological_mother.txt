The biological mother of Modesty Barebone lived with her husband and ten children in a tenement in the Bronx in the 1910s and/or 1920s. However, Modesty was adopted by Mary Lou Barebone, a No-Maj anti-witchcraft activist, possibly because the family had more children than they could care for or were magical.
