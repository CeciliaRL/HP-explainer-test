This Niffler accompanied Newt Scamander as he researched for his upcoming book. It visited New York in 1926 and Paris in 1927.


== Biography ==


=== 1926 ===
The Niffler was born sometime before December 1926 and was rescued by Newt Scamander, and consequently placed inside of his magically-expanded suitcase full of magical beasts.

In December of 1926 during Newt's trip to New York, the Niffler escaped to steal a beggar's coin. It then sneaked into the Steen National Bank and caused mass chaos as it attempted to secure valuables and treasure. It eventually founds its way into the vaults, where it was captured by Newt.
When Jacob Kowalski accidentally swapped his and Newt's cases, it was taken to the former's apartment. When Kowalski opened the case, he accidentally released a selection of Newt's creatures, one of which was the Niffler, that hid behind a photo of Kowalski's grandmother to avoid being discovered by Newt.

The Niffler eventually found its way to a downtown jewellery store where it attempted to evade Newt, the two of them causing massive amounts of property damage in the meantime. However, it was eventually captured again and placed back inside of the case.


=== 1927 ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Niffler finding Tina's footprints 		 	 
In September of 1927, the Niffler was taken to Paris by Newt in the latter's attempt to find Tina Goldstein and Credence Barebone. It was set on the ground of Place Cach√©e to sniff out Tina's scent and footprints. It soon after, found the footprints and was put back into the case, after Newt saw a man and chased after his feather tracking him down.

The Niffler then snuck out of Newt's case in the Lestrange Family Mausoleum where it secretely secured Gellert Grindelwald's vial of his and Albus Dumbledore's blood from a long-ago blood pact. When Grindelwald attacked a group of Aurors with blue fire, one of the Niffler's front paws was injured, causing it to walk with a painful limp. He was most likely healed as he could walk normally.

 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Newt, Albus and the Niffler walking towards Hogwarts 		 	 
As Newt took his suitcase to Hogwarts to meet with Albus Dumbledore, he took out the vial, and when Dumbledore enquired as to how he got it, he showed him his Niffler. Newt then carefully set the Niffler down and walked across the Viaduct with Albus Dumbledore to the Hogwarts Castle. Albus asked Newt if the Niffler would like a cup of tea, but Newt replied saying he'll like a milk but hide the teaspoons.


== Physical description ==
Like most Nifflers, Newt's Niffler had tan skin, black fur, a long snout, and partially-webbed paws. Some of the hair on its head was tinged with grey, perhaps a symbol of old age. It also had a small pouch on its belly that could fit much more than it seemed through use of natural magic similar to that of the Undetectable Extension Charm. The Niffler looked like a cross between a mole and a platypus.


== Personality and traits ==
The Niffler was incredibly intelligent and mischievous. It was able to recognise when it disobeyed Newt, yet continued to do it anyway. It also displayed recognition of the consequences of its actions, showing this when it shared an uneasy glance with Newt after the two crashed into the jewellery store's window.
However, it later developed a gentler and more respectful personality, most notable when it stole Grindelwald's vial of blood for Newt, and when it was released in a Paris square and did not run off or steal from anyone other then sneaking a couple golden items from a shop front while Newt was talking with Jacob.


== Relationships ==


=== Newton Scamander ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Newton Scamander, its owner 		 	 
The two often competed for dominance during the Niffler's attempts at freedom. The Niffler recognised Newt's authority yet continued to run amok and steal from others. However, the duo soon developed a closer relationship as Newt trusted the Niffler enough to set free for short periods of time in a foreign city, and in turn the Niffler was able to procure Grindelwald's blood vial.


=== The Beasts ===
The Niffler was never said or shown to cause any harm to other beasts or interfere with their lives. Newt apparently trusted the Niffler to let it wander around the suitcase unwatched, something he did not do with other creatures, such as the Erumpent.


=== Possible offspring ===

In Newt's basement, four young Nifflers lived there. It is possible that they were the young of Newt's adult Niffler that found a mate sometime between December, 1926, and September, 1927, or was pregnant before then. However, it is equally possible that these young are the offspring of some other Niffler that Newt rescued, or were rescued on their own without a parent. One of them displays the same colour as the original Niffler.


=== Habitat ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			The baby Niffler's cage 		 	 
The baby Nifflers' home was somewhat like a birdcage except beautifully ornate with rich fabrics, shining jewels, and of course, gold. They get tossed into this mini home after they finally got captured and taken away from their mischievous play when Newt arrived home and calmed down all his rowdy creatures.


== Behind the scenes ==

Eddie Redmayne, the actor who portrays Newton Scamander in the Fantastic Beasts films, jokingly commented that he had developed a "love hate" relationship with the fictional creature.
