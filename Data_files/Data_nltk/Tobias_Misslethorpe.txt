== Biography ==


=== Life ===
During his lifetime, Misslethorpe founded Witch Weekly, a popular magazine for witches, serving as its first editor.

== Etymology ==
The name "Tobias" is the Greek form of Tobiah. This is the name of the hero of the apocryphal Book of Tobit in many English versions of the Old Testament. It relates how Tobias, with the help of the archangel Raphael, is able to drive away a demon who has been plaguing Sarah, who subsequently becomes his wife. It is also known that he shares the same first name as that of Tobias Snape, who is the Muggle father of Severus Snape.


== Behind the scenes ==
Misslethorpe's portrait was based on an 1881 elegiac of Prime-Minister Benjamin Disraeli, by John Everett Millais (1829â€“1896). The face, however, was modelled after Barry Wilkinson, the props master on all eight Harry Potter films.
This character's portrait can be seen in the "The Quest of Sir Cadogan" feature on Disc 2 of the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban DVD.
