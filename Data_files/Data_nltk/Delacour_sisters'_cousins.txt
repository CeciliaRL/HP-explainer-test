The cousins of Fleur and Gabrielle Delacour were two French Veela, or part-Veela, who attended Fleur's wedding to Bill Weasley in the summer of 1997.


== Biography ==
When they attended the wedding, the two Veela had exotic flowers and bewitched birds decorating their hats. Their beauty quickly attracted the attention of Fred and George Weasley, two of the groom's younger brothers. Fred escorted them inside the Burrow while George was forced to assist a "gaggle of middle-aged witches".
Later that evening, during the reception, Harry Potter noticed that Fred and George "disappeared into the darkness" with Fleur's cousins.


== Behind the scenes ==
One of the Veela cousins was portrayed by Alison Cain in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.
These two girls must be more distant cousins to Fleur and Gabrielle Delacour than first cousins, as they are full-blooded Veela, whereas the Delacours are quarter-Veela. This indicates that they could not have had the same grandparents, since Fleur and Gabrielle's grandfather was a wizard. They are presumably related to the Delacours through their maternal grandmother, who was a Veela. Alternatively George could simply be using the term 'Veela cousins' to mean that they have visible Veela ancestry. It is not directly stated that they are full blooded Veela and may simply be part-Veela like Fleur and Gabrielle.
