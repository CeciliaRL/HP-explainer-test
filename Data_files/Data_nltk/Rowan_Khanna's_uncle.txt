This individual was a British wizard and the uncle of Rowan Khanna.


== Biography ==
It can be presumed that he grew up in the family business, as he knew enough about woodworking to become a top broom-maker as an adult. He apparently did very good, meticulous work and was very proud of it, since crafting a single broom would take him a few months and would cost a few thousand galleons. Rowan suggested they could ask his uncle to make one for Jacob's sibling after they learned the easiest way to enter the Forbidden Forest unseen was by flying. This suggestion was, however, too time-consuming and costly for it to go anywhere, as Rowan's friend ultimately borrowed a broom from someone else instead.
