Corrine Cribb was a dark witch.


== Biography ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Corrine talking to Hagrid 		 	 
She threatened Rubeus Hagrid that she would ask the owner of a female Chinese Fireball to sell the dragon to her, because she wanted to make a dragon-skin coat out of her.
Cribb's desire to purchase the dragon failed thankfully, since Jacob's sibling and Penny Haywood managed to cure her inability to breathe fire with an altered Pepperup Potion, leaving Cribb very angry that she would no longer be able to buy the dragon from its owner. She swore revenge against Hagrid, but Hagrid later told the two students that her "bark was worse than her bite", and that she would be burned if she tried to capture the dragon herself.


== Physical appearance ==
She looked like a middle-aged woman in the late 1980s. She wore all black. She had dark coloured eyes and black hair with two strands of grey hair made into a bun.


== Personality and traits ==
According to Rubeus Hagrid, Corrine Cribb was a cruel and callous witch with an utter disregard for both people and animals, as shown with her sadistic desire to have a dragon skinned alive simply to make a coat from its skin. She also saw no problem with threatening other individuals. However, Hagrid acknowledged that her "bark was worse than her bite", meaning her threats were often empty.
