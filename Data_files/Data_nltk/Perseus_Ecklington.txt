Perseus Ecklington was a wizard who, in his youth, courted Daisy Twemlove.
On the eve of Ecklington's wedding to Daisy Twemlove, Norville Bezerko, his love rival, slipped a powerful Sleeping Potion into his butterbeer mug, sending him into a deep death-like sleep. Bezerko prompty presented himself at Daisy's house, telling her that Ecklington had died of panic at the prospect of marrying her. An unsuspecting Daisy accepted a proposal of marriage from Bezerko the moment Ecklington was buried.
Ecklington was put in a coffin, and, just as he was being lowered into the ground, he woke up, as the effects of the Sleeping Potion had worn off. Ecklington soon realised Bezerko's scheme, and a brawl ensued. Bezerko was left with an elephant's trunk and six ears, thus hampering his chances of finding another bride, and Daisy Twemlove was reunited with Perseus Ecklington.
