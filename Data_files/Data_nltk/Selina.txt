Selina was a neighbour of Chiara Lobosca and the two were best friends. When Chiara confessed that she was a werewolf, Selina wasn't afraid at first. However, after witnessing one of Chiara's transformations, which horrified her, her memory of the incident was erased by Chiara's mother at Chiara's request. After this, Chiara cut all contact with her, along with people in general due to her condition.
