This Muggle boy was living in Godric's Hollow in the 1980s.


== Biography ==

The boy was presumably born in the Muggle part of Godric's Hollow. On Hallowe'en in 1981, the boy came across Lord Voldemort. Thinking that the Dark Lord was a Muggle in a Hallowe'en disguise, he made a cheerful comment. Upon seeing Voldemort's face, however, he fled in terror. Voldemort considered killing him, but decided it was "unnecessary", as he had more important matters to attend to.
