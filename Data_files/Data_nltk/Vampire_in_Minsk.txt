This vampire had a disagreement with the half-giant Rubeus Hagrid in a pub in Minsk in the summer of 1995.


== Behind the scenes ==
The way Hagrid explained the encounter suggests that the 'disagreement' was a fight of some kind, however, this was not confirmed.
The fact that this vampire was in Belarus in Eastern Europe may be a reference to the fact that vampires such as Dracula are traditionally said to haunt this area.
