Mr Goyle was a Dark Wizard, Death Eater, husband of Mrs Goyle and the father of Gregory. Goyle fought during the First Wizarding War. He didn't search for Lord Voldemort after his first downfall, but this was forgiven in 1995, after Voldemort's return at the Little Hangleton graveyard, in which Goyle was present. Goyle possibly fought at several battles of the Second Wizarding War, including the Battle of Hogwarts. After the battle and Voldemort's final defeat, Goyle was presumably killed or imprisoned in Azkaban.


== Biography ==


=== First Wizarding War ===
Goyle was a Death Eater during the First Wizarding War and was loyal to his master up until his downfall, when Goyle managed to avoid Azkaban. Around the downfall of Voldemort, Goyle and his wife had a baby boy, Gregory Goyle, who would be educated at Hogwarts from 1991 to 1998, and be friends with Vincent Crabbe and Draco Malfoy.


=== Second Wizarding War ===
Goyle was one of the few Death Eaters who returned to Lord Voldemort when he rose to power again in 1995. Voldemort was displeased when he learned that Goyle did not attempt to find him, but Goyle was forgiven.
During the 1995-1996 school year, Goyle's son, Gregory, and Crabbe's son, Vincent, both cornered Susan Bones, and Gregory told her that his father thought that her aunt Amelia Bones was a trouble-maker.
His actions following his master's return are unknown. It is likely that he participated in many battles during the Second Wizarding War, including the Battle of Hogwarts. He was presumably killed or imprisoned in Azkaban following Voldemort's defeat.


== Physical description ==
Much like his son he was described as a large man, about as large as Crabbe and significantly more so than Nott. He was also known to have a dull sounding voice.


== Personality and traits ==
Not much is known about Goyle's individual personality, though he appeared to be somewhat unintelligent. He was however outspoken against certain Ministry of Magic employees such as Amelia Bones, possibly for being against the Death Eaters or for giving Harry Potter a free trial. He apparently was not loyal enough to search for his master after his original downfall or otherwise believed him to be finished. Being a Death Eater, it can presumed he shared his master's ideals of pure-blood supremacy, as he was one of the Death Eaters who returned to Voldemort's side once he had returned, showing his loyalty and commitment to his dark master and his cause.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Dark Arts: Being a Death Eater, Goyle would have been accomplished with dark magic, likely including the Unforgivable Curses.
Apparition: Like most adult wizards, Goyle was capable of apparating at will. He successfully apparated to the Little Hangleton graveyard in 1995 to witness the return of his master.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is not specified if Goyle attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, though if he did he was likely in Slytherin like his son.
Goyle's only specified appearance is in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It is unverified if he participated in any of the later events of the Second Wizarding War.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, Goyle was played by Alex Palmer, but was only credited as "Death Eater".
