Mr Warren was a Muggle and the father of Muggle-born witch Myrtle Elizabeth Warren, who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and was killed by a Basilisk there on 13 June, 1943. He planned to go to the school with his wife soon after this tragedy occurred.
His daughter's ghost, known as Moaning Myrtle, resided in the girls' bathroom at Hogwarts.


== Behind the scenes ==
According to Tom Riddle, Myrtle's parents would get to Hogwarts some time after their daughter's death. However, it's unknown if this happened as Hogwarts can't be seen by Muggles. However it is likely that these spells were temporarily removed to allow them to collect their child's body, or an employee of Hogwarts escorted them in order to make the castle visible.
