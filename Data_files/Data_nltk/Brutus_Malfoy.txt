Brutus Malfoy (fl. 1675) was a British pure-blood wizard who lived during the 17th century. He edited the anti-Muggle periodical Warlock at War, and advocated the notion that witches and wizards who associated with Muggles lacked magical talent, writing in 1675, "Nothing is a surer sign of weak magic than a weakness for non-magical company."
In Brutus Malfoy's lifetime, persecution of wizards and witches by Muggles was at its height. Under these circumstances, anti-Muggle sentiments were widespread in the wizarding community. Brutus himself perpetuated the prejudice that wizards and witches who associated with Muggles lacked intelligence and magical ability.
Brutus's descendants include later members of the Malfoy family such as Abraxas, Lucius, Draco and Scorpius Malfoy.


== Etymology ==
The name "Brutus" is a Roman cognomen meaning "heavy" in Latin. Famous bearers include Lucius Junius Brutus, the traditional founder of the Roman Republic, and Marcus Junius Brutus, the statesman who conspired to assassinate Julius Caesar.


== Behind the scenes ==
In 1992, Harry Potter, speaking about Draco Malfoy, said, "Look at his family... The whole lot of them have been in Slytherin, he's always boasting about it". This indicates that Brutus was most likely a Slytherin if he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, though it cannot be confirmed.
In 1997, a portrait was hung in Malfoy Manor showing a wizard; Brutus may be that wizard.
