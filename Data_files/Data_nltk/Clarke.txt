Clarke was an American No-Maj who served as an Assistant District Attorney in the 1920s.
On 6 December 1926, Clarke convinced judge Rufus Foster to reconsider his decision to summarily dismiss a grand jury, which had leaked a court document to the press. Thus, Foster instead ordered the jury to deliver any indictments they had found within three days, at which point they would be dismissed. The incident was reported in the 6 December 1926 issue of the New York Chronicle.


== Behind the scenes ==
The text of the article mentioning Clarke in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was taken from the real 21 November 1922 issue of The Evening World. This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in 1926, but the actual historical event referenced happened in 1922.
