Oswald Beamish (1850 - 1932) was a wizarding activist and a pioneer of Goblin rights. He is featured on a Chocolate Frog Card for this reason.


== Etymology ==
The name "Oswald" is derived from the Old English elements os "god" and weald "rule". Saint Oswald was a king of Northumbria who introduced Christianity to northeast England in the 7th century before being killed in battle. There was also an Old Norse cognate √Åsvaldr in use in England, being borne by the 10th-century Saint Oswald of Worcester, who was of Danish ancestry. Though the name had died out by the end of the Middle Ages, it was revived in the 19th century.
