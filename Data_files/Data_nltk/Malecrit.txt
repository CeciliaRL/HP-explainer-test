Malecrit was a French wizard who lived in the early 15th century. 


== Biography ==
A playwright, Malecrit wrote the Hélas, Je me suis Transfiguré Les Pieds, a play which included a reference to the game of Quidditch, showing that the game had spread to France by the early 1400s.
As reported by French wizarding newspaper Le Cri de la Gargouille, in 1927, some unpublished works by Malecrit were found in a dragon cave.


== Etymology ==
"Malecrit" presumably derives from the French mal écrit, which means "poorly written".


== Behind the scenes ==
Interestingly, despite the pun the name already contained, in the French translated edition, the name was altogether changed into "Forbien Narré" (pronounced fort bien narré, which means "well narrated").
