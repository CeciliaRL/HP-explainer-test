Tabitha Tabella, also known by the nickname La Bella, was an American wizarding criminal who operated in the 1920s.

In 1926, the Magical Congress of the United States of America issued a wanted poster for Tabella, which stated that she was wanted for "Dragot laundering," "defenestration of wizards," and "No-Maj murder." It warned that she was "bearing [a] wand and extremely dangerous." The poster promised a reward of 2538 Dragots for information leading to her capture. This poster was hanging in The Blind Pig when Newt Scamander visited in December 1926.
