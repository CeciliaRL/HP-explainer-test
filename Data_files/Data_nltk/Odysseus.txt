Odysseus was a Ancient Greek  hero who slew the one-eyed giant Cyclops with the help of several sheep.


== Etymology ==
The name Odysseus was probably derived from the Ancient Greek verb odussomai, meaning "hate", suggesting that the name could be rendered as "the one who is wrathful/hated." This interpretation is reinforced by Odysseus's and Poseidon's mutual wrath in Homer's The Odyssey.

Odysseus is based on the Greek hero of legend.
