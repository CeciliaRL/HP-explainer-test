Ellie Cattermole (fl. 1997) was the daughter of Mary and Reginald Cattermole. She had a brother, Alfred, and a sister, Maisie. She lived at 27 Chislehurst Gardens, Great Tolling, Evesham with her parents, brother and sister.
Mary Cattermole said that Ellie and her siblings were frightened during her interrogation by the Muggle-Born Registration Commission. They believed that their mother would not return home.
Her mother told the Ministry that Ellie and her brother and sister were at home. They were probably not attending Hogwarts yet, because Harry Potter told her and her husband to pick up the children and run away.
