This wizard was appointed Headmaster of Hogwarts at some point before Professor Dippet. After his death, his portrait was hung in the Headmaster's office, in order to give advice to the current head. The large text on his portrait reads "TV NE CEDE MALIS SED CONTRA AVDEN-TIOR ITO" which may translate as "do not give in to evil but proceed ever more boldly against it."
Apparently a disciplinarian, this individual's portrait was critical of the way Albus Dumbledore ran the school. At the end of their fourth year, when Jacob's sibling was summoned to the Headmaster's Office after having discovered the Forest Vault and breaking the sleepwalking curse, this portrait referred to them as "a troublemaker".
