Stuart Hogg (b. 24 June, 1992), a professional rugby union player who plays as a full-back for the Scottish rugby team since 2012, was rumoured to be a very talented Squib. He was, however, a wizard.
In 2014, it came under suspect among wizarding circles, that Stuart Hogg, along with Kelly Brown and Jim Hamilton, were smuggled into the team by the WSSRU, in violation of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.
