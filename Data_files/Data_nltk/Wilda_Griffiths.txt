Wilda Griffiths was a witch and Chaser on the Puddlemere United Quidditch team. Before that, she was a Chaser for the Holyhead Harpies; her departure from the team was a sore spot for the Harpies, especially for Captain Gwenog Jones. When Puddlemere and the Harpies faced off for the first time after Griffiths' move, the game turned into a riot, during which Griffiths disappeared, and it is unknown what happened to her.
