The only daughter of Harfang Longbottom and Callidora Black was a pure-blood witch.. She had a brother. She was a first cousin of Arthur Weasley and possibly Bartemius Crouch Snr through her mother. She was also possibly related to Frank Longbottom and his son through her father.


== Behind the scenes ==
Nothing else is known about her. Initially, it was speculated that she was actually Neville's great-aunt Enid, although this was not the case, as Enid was more of an affinity relative of the Longbottoms, being the wife of Neville's great-uncle Algie Longbottom.
