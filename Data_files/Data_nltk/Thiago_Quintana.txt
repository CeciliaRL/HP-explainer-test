Thiago Quintana was an American wizard. He, along with Shikoba Wolfe, Johannes Jonker, and Violetta Beauvais, was one of four wandmakers who served North America in the early 20th century.


== Biography ==
Quintana's wands caused a sensation when they were first introduced. Sleek and unusually long in design, they produced spells of "force and elegance". They contained a single spine taken from the back of one of the White River Monsters native to Arkansas. Initially, there were fears that the species was being over-fished, but the ecological impact was lessened by the fact that only Quintana knew how to lure the creatures. He fiercely guarded this secret up until his death, after which wands containing White River Monster spine cores were no longer made.
