Harold Skively was a wizard who wrote a letter to the Daily Prophet suggesting that the wizarding world should celebrate a day to honour Merlin, since he would like an extra day of holiday.


== Etymology ==
The name "Harold" comes from the Old English name Hereweald meaning "leader of the army", derived from the elements here "army" and weald "leader, ruler". The Old Norse cognate Haraldr was also common among Scandinavian settlers in England.
'To skive' is an English verb that means 'to avoid one's assigned work or duty', or 'to slack off'.
