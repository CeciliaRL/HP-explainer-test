The grandmother of Jacob Kowalski lived in the early 20th century. She was an experienced baker, as her grandson mentioned her recipe for paczki when he applied for a loan to open his own bakery. She was also responsible to instilling a love of baking into him.
A picture of her hung above Jacob Kowalski's bed at his home in New York.

She most likely died sometime before 1926, given the way Jacob talks to her portrait.
