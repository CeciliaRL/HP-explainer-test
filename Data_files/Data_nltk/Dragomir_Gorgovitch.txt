Dragomir Gorgovitch was a wizard who played as a Chaser for the Chudley Cannons.


== Biography ==
Gorgovitch transferred to the Cannons in 1995 for a "record fee," and held the record for the most Quaffle drops in a season. Ron Weasley tried not to think about him if he could, probably because his favourite team was the Cannons.
In 1997, after Harry Potter had a vision about wandmaker Gregorovitch, Ron wondered if he was referring to Gorgovitch instead; as, at the time, Harry didn't know who Gregorovitch was, the only hint he had to go on was that he may have been somehow connected to Quidditch.
When selecting an alias for himself, during the Break-in of Gringotts Wizarding Bank (1998), Ron named himself Dragomir Despard, most likely an allusion to Dragomir Gorgovitch.


== Etymology ==
The name "Dragomir" means "precious and peaceful" from the Slavic element dorgu meaning "precious" combined with mir "peace".
