Gossamer was an individual whose portrait was hung in Hogwarts Castle.


== Biography ==
He was unpopular among the other portraits for his chaotic personality. As a punishment, his portrait was removed from the Grand Staircase, put into chains and hidden in one of the House common rooms.
Decades later, in 2008, it was found by a group of students who freed him. He continued his mischievous behaviour, angering other portraits, including an angry wizard. When the students met him again, he suggested organising a search party as one of the witches and wizards he had talked to went away, but after the students pointed out they had left probably to get away from him, he was saddened and thought he was cursed to remain friendless forever. When Argus Filch found the students and released a trio of Red Caps on them, they battled them to prevent them from getting Gossamer, which moved him and accepted the students being his friends. He suggested they place him in a more secluded place, and he end up being moved back to a common room.
