Cho Chang and her friends 		 	 
As a Hogwarts student, Cho Chang had a close circle of friends who were all fellow Ravenclaw girls, which included Marietta Edgecombe. They all gravitated to Cho because of her beauty and popularity, and could often be seen following Cho in a group around the school.


== History ==
During her time at Hogwarts, Cho Chang formed a group of friends among her fellow Ravenclaws. Marietta Edgecombe was a known member of Cho's close friendship circle. As the pretty and popular Seeker of the Ravenclaw Quidditch team, Cho was the centre of the group.
In 1994, Harry Potter could not find Cho alone to ask her to the Yule Ball because she was always surrounded by at least four or five friends. When he finally asked her to speak with him privately, her friends all giggled, probably because they knew that he intended to ask her out.
However, Cho became depressed and began experiencing grief-induced mood swings following the murder of her boyfriend Cedric Diggory. Her friends all abandoned her in her time of need except Marietta. The two stuck by each other throughout both the 1995–1996 school year and the 1996–1997 school year.
