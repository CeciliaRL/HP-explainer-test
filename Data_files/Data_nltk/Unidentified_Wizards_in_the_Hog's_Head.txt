Two wizards were in the Hog's Head Inn in 1995 on the day several Hogwarts students met there to discuss the formation of their own Defence Against the Dark Arts group. They wore cloaks and sat in the corner. Harry Potter would have thought they were Dementors, had they not been speaking in strong Yorkshire accents.
