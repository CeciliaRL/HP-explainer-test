Sylvian Jolicoeur was a Haitian wizard who played as the Seeker for the 2014 Haitian National Quidditch team.


== Biography ==
During the third match of the 427th Quidditch World Cup, Haiti versus Brazil, Jolicoeur came within inches of capturing the Snitch and securing the win, but fellow Beater Jean-Baptiste Bloncourt's devastating mis-hit of the Bludger knocked him out cold (the second such incident of the match, the first one left Keeper Lenelle Paraison with a broken nose).
The Snitch proceeded to get caught up in Jean-Baptiste Bloncourt's sleeve, who incurred in Snitchnip when he wrestled it out of his undergarments and grabbed it. The team was immediately disqualified. Following the match, Jolicoeur was reported to have been making a good recovery.
