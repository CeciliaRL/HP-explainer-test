Rosalind Antigone Bungs was a witch. She was one of the names that Hermione Granger found while researching who could possibly be R.A.B., but she believed that R.A.B. knew Voldemort personally, and couldn't find anything that suggested a connection between Voldemort and Rosalind.


== Etymology ==
"Rosalind" is derived from the Germanic elements hros "horse" and linde "soft, tender". This name was introduced by the Normans to England, though it was not common. During the Middle Ages its spelling was influenced by the Latin phrase rosa linda "beautiful rose". The name was popularised by Edmund Spencer, who used it in his poetry, and by William Shakespeare, who used it for the heroine in his comedy As You Like It (1599).
A "bung" is a stopper especially for the hole through which a cask, keg, or barrel is filled or emptied.
