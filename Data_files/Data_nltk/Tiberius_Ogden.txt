Tiberius Ogden was a former member of the Wizengamot (described as an elder member), but resigned in protest due to Cornelius Fudge's appointment of Dolores Umbridge as High Inquisitor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the continuing campaign by the Ministry of Magic and the Daily Prophet to discredit Albus Dumbledore and Harry Potter.
Tiberius Ogden was the friend who told Professor Tofty, Harry Potter's Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L. Examiner, that he could perform a corporeal Patronus.
He may be related to Bob Ogden, who also worked for the Ministry of Magic as the Head of the Magical Law Enforcement Patrol, or the makers of Ogden's Old Firewhiskey.
