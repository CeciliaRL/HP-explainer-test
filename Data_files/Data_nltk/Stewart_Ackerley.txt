== Etymology ==
"Stewart" is from an occupational surname originally belonging to a person who was a steward. It is ultimately derived from Old English stig "house" and weard "guard". As a given name, it arose in 19th century Scotland in honour of the Stuart royal family, which produced several kings and queens of Scotland and Britain between the 14th and 18th centuries.
"Ackerley" is a Middle English name meaning 'aker', a division of land + 'ley', a lea or field.
