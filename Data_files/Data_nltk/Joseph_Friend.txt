Joseph H. Friend was an American No-Maj man. 


== Biography ==
Friend disappeared on 2 December 1926 upon learning that John Haas had been dismissed from his job at the Columbia Bank. Haas was arraigned four days later, along with his alleged accomplice William Friend, for the crime of defrauding the bank of $121,000. Police suspected Joseph H. Friend might also have been involved in the theft. They were seeking him at the time the New York Chronicle reported on the case on 6 December.


== Behind the scenes ==
The text of the article mentioning Joseph H. Friend in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was taken from the real 21 November 1922 issue of The Evening World. This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in 1926, but the actual events referenced occurred in 1922.
