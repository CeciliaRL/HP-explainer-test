Henry "Harry" Potter was either a pure-blood or half-blood wizard who served on the Wizengamot from 1913 to 1921. He was the father of Fleamont Potter, the paternal grandfather of James Potter, the great-grandfather of the famous Harry Potter, and the great-great-grandfather of James Sirius, Albus Severus, and Lily Luna Potter.


== Biography ==
Henry was born somewhere in England in or prior to 1892. He was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe Potter on his father's side. His mother was a member of the Fleamont family. It was her dying wish that Henry preserve her maiden name, which would otherwise die with her, and thus he named his son Fleamont.
Henry served as a member of the Wizengamot from 1913 to 1921. He caused a minor controversy by publicly condemning the then-Minister for Magic Archer Evermonde's decision to forbid the wizarding community from aiding Muggles during the First World War. Henry's outspoken pro-Muggle views were one of the chief reasons for the Potter family's exclusion from the Sacred Twenty-Eight.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is possible that James and Lily Potter named their son, Harry Potter, after him.
In the American film It's a Wonderful Life (director Frank Capra, 1946), "Henry F. Potter" is the name of the antagonist, whose mannerisms are much akin to Lucius Malfoy.
