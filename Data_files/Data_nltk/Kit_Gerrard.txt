Kit Gerrard was a British wizard who was reporter from the Daily Prophet.


== Biography ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			The Daily Prophet reports the disappearance of Kit Gerrard, among others 		 	 
He were one of the wizards who mysteriously vanished during the London Five sometime during the mid-to-late 2010s. His disappearance occurred within a few hours of the four Aurors. It was the first instance of people having gone mysteriously missing since the Second Wizarding War, and hence came as a great shock to the wizarding community of Great Britain at large. 
An investigation was launched by the British Ministry of Magic to try and locate Gerrard and their fellow victims. As time passed, however, the Ministry met a dead end when the trail went cold, and it was generally felt by many that the chance of finding Gerrard grew increasingly smaller, causing the despair of their family to increase and turn into outrage when the case was closed. As Gareth Greengrass indeed speculated, it is very likely that Gerrard was deceased, as of 2018, though there was a small chance they were still alive.
In December 2020, during another surge of Calamity, Gerrard was found inside the portrait of Merlin in the Grand Staircase in Hogwarts Castle. Unfortunately, he could not be able to remember anything about himself or how he got there.
