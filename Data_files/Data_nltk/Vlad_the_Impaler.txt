Vlad the Impaler was the son of Count Vlad Drakul. He was the Prince of Wallachia, which later became Romania. Despite being the son of a known vampire, Vlad Drakul, it is unclear whether or not Vlad the Impaler was one as well.


== Behind the scenes ==
Little is known of vampires in J. K. Rowling's work, but the existence of partial vampires hints that it is possible for a person to be born a vampire without the need of being "turned". Children of humans and vampires would otherwise always be human. This raises the question as to whether Vlad the Impaler is a half-vampire, vampire, or human, but nothing has been confirmed as of yet.
Vladislav III, also known as Vlad the Impaler, was an actual historical figure. He was Prince of Wallachia who reigned three times between 1448 and 1476. His epithet, "Impaler", originated from his favoured method of executing those who opposed him. Vlad III is indeed widely speculated to have been the inspiration behind the title character of Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula.
Gary Oldman, who plays Sirius Black in the Harry Potter films, played Vlad the Impaler in the 1992 film, Bram Stoker's Dracula.
