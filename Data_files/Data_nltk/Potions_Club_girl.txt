== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
The girl came to be educated at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and was sorted into Hufflepuff House, with Pomona Sprout, the Herbology Professor, as her Head of House. She shared a dormitory with other girls in the Hufflepuff Basement, located below ground level and near the Hogwarts kitchens. At some point, she set up the Potions Club in Professor Sprout's greenhouses, probably after asking permission, in order to help others get their Potions homework done, as well as to help others brew potions.


=== 1996-1997 ===
In 1996, she continued as the leader of Potions Club with the new Potions Master being Professor Horace E.F. Slughorn. This year, Harry Potter came to the Hufflepuff girl and asked if he could join the club in order to brew a Shrinking Solution to help him get Ginny Weasley to go with him to Hogsmeade. She told him that he must first prove that he is a good Potioneer and asked him to brew a Volubilis Potion, which was also her favourite potion and could be used to change the drinker's voice, which she considered a waste. After he successfully made the potion, she accepted him into the Club and allowed him to brew a Shrinking Solution as well as the Wiggenweld potion to help him on his trip with Dumbledore.
