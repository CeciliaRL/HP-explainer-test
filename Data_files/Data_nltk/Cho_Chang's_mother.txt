Madam Chang (b. 7 September) was a British witch, employee of the British Ministry of Magic, and the mother of Cho Chang.


== Biography ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Madam Chang's daughter Cho 		 	 
Her birthday was 7 September. Cho remembered this fact at the last minute in 1995 and rushed to the Owlery at Hogwarts to send her mother a gift.
Madam Chang (like her husband) wanted her daughter to not get on Dolores Umbridge's bad side in her sixth year. However, Cho went against their wishes and joined Dumbledore's Army. Umbridge later threatened to fire Madam Chang because of her daughter's involvement in the DA.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Hermione Granger mentions that Dolores Umbridge is threatening to fire Cho's mother from her job at the Ministry of Magic, presumably because of Cho's involvement in Dumbledore's Army. This addition to the plot was likely made because Marietta Edgecombe and her mother, a known Ministry employee, were cut from the script.
