Helixa Hyslop was a witch who, along with her twin sister, Syna, invented the Doubling Charm.


== Biography ==
The twins were an eccentric pair who lived together in a mansion all of their lives and preferred to keep to themselves. After they died, their relatives discovered that there were two identical copies of everything in their home, right down to the set of hand-written instructions for the Doubling Spell that they each left on one of the pair of matching tables in the kitchen.
