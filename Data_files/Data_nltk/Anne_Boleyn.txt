Anne Boleyn (c. 1501 â€“ 19 May 1536) was Queen consort of England between 1533 and 1536, as the second wife of the notorious King Henry VIII, and mother to Queen Elizabeth I of England.
Boleyn was accused by Muggles of being a witch. There may have been a popular wizarding theory that she was instead a Squib. However, Anne's true blood status is unknown.
If Boleyn was indeed a Squib, it suggests her siblings could be magical. Notable direct descendants of Anne's sister Mary are Queen Elizabeth II and Diana, Princess of Wales. This could imply that they have magical blood along with descendants including Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.
A portrait of a woman resembling Anne hung in the Grand Staircase, near the second-floor landing, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
