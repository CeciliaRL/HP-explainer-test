Mrs Krum (fl. 1977-1995) was a Bulgarian witch, who was the mother of Viktor Krum. She was described as having dark hair.
Mrs Krum travelled to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with her husband to watch Viktor face the final task of the Triwizard Tournament in 1995.
Her son told Harry Potter that his grandfather was murdered by Gellert Grindelwald. It is possible that this man was either Mrs Krum's father or her father-in-law.
