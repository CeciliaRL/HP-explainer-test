Matilda Dukelow was a Quidditch fan who supported the Holyhead Harpies. She attended the match between the Harpies and Puddlemere United on 30 September, 1999. When she witnessed Puddlemere Chaser Wilda Griffiths disappear, she came to the conclusion that Griffiths had made herself invisible, which is not allowed in Quidditch. It took a while for her to acknowledge the fact that Griffiths had been abducted.


== Etymology ==
The name "Matilda" is from the Germanic name Mahthildis meaning "strength in battle", from the elements maht "might, strength" and hild "battle". Saint Matilda was the wife of the 10th-century German king Henry I the Fowler. The name was brought to England by the Normans, being borne by the wife of William the Conqueror himself. It was popular until the 15th century in England, usually in the vernacular form Maud. Both forms were revived by the 19th century. This name appears in the popular Australian folk song 'Waltzing Matilda', written in 1895.
