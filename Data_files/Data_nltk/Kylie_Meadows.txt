== Etymology ==
The name "Kylie" arose in Australia, where it means "boomerang" in Noongar, an Australian Aboriginal language. It is more likely a feminine form of Kyle, and it is in this capacity that it began to be used in America in the 1970s. A famous bearer is the Australian pop singer Kylie Minogue (1968-).
