Bogomil Levski was a Bulgarian wizard and a Chaser for the 2014 Bulgarian National Quidditch team. His father Alexei Levski played in the 1994 Quidditch World Cup final.


== Biography ==
During the first round match of the 427th Quidditch World Cup, against New Zealand, Levski was involved in a mid-air collision with opposing Chaser Dennis Moon. The crash seemed accidental to many spectators, but Moon was sent off. The New Zealand manager Charlie Baverstock proclaimed himself 'madder then a bloke who's been locked in a box of Fwoopers', after the sending off. Bulgaria won the game 410 - 170.


== Etymology ==
