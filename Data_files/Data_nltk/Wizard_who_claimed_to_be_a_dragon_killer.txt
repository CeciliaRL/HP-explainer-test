This individual was a wizard who attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup between Bulgaria and Ireland. He claimed that he was a dragon killer in an attempt to impress a group of Veela, but his friend stated that he was actually a dishwasher at the Leaky Cauldron. It is extremely unlikely that the "dragon killer"'s claim was true.
