Mr Turner was a wizard who was the father of Lottie Turner, an artist, and a butterfly Animagus.


== Biography ==
He used to say "you could tell a story with three colours and a good oxtail stippler", which meant a paintbrush.
After his daughter Lottie was born, he often painted with her, and he would sometimes travel off to far places to paint. At some point, he drew himself in his butterfly Animagus form.
He put up a fight when confronted by Bly, a Dark Wizard in search of the Turner family's heirloom, but was eventually murdered. After Bly was captured inside Hogwarts, he transformed back to himself in his portrait and spoke with Lottie, allowing her to keep the family heirloom, a brush.
