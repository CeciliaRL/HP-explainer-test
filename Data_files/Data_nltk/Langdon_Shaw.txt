== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
While his older brother, the senator Henry Shaw Junior, was Shaw Snr's pride and joy, Langdon was viewed as something of a failure and disappointment. This did not stop him from constantly trying to seek his father's approval.


=== The Obscurus ===


==== Meeting the Barebones ====

On 6 December 1926, Langdon brought Mary Lou Barebone from the New Salem Philanthropic Society and her adopted children Credence, Chastity and Modesty to Shaw News meet with his father. Barging into Shaw Snr's office, Langdon laid out a portfolio filled with a series of photographic evidence of witchcraft and told his father of his belief that "strange things [were] going on all over" New York and that the people behind these incidents were "not like [them]," certain that he was giving him the scoop of the century. His father and brother both dismissed his claims.

Henry Shaw Senior refused to give Mary Lou the support of his newspaper company and his elder son's re-election platform, and asked the Barebone family to leave. While they were departing, Mary Lou's adopted son Credence dropped a leaflet, which Henry Shaw Jr handed back to him, while unashamedly and cruelly calling him a freak.


==== Attack on the Fundraising Dinner Hall ====

Langdon later attended his brother's fundraising dinner with his father. While his brother was in the middle of his speech, an invisible force burst forth from beneath the organ. It soared across the hall, sending tables flying, and throwing people around as it carved a line toward the stage where Shaw Jr was still standing. Langdon watched as the invisible force threw his brother backwards against his poster, and then raised him up high where he was suspended for just a moment in midair before being thrown violently back down onto the stage, dead. In the midst of sounds of anguish and panic from the crowd, his father crouched beside his slain son. Langdon, who was slightly drunk, determinedly and triumphantly stated that this was the work of witchcraft.


==== Obscurial attack on New York ====

 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Langdon Shaw and other No-Majes having their memories erased with the magical rain 		 	 
On the next night, 7 December 1926, Langdon was present when Credence Barebone unleashed his Obscurus on New York, and MACUSA began magically sealing off the subway entrance where Credence had taken refuge. Having seen magic first-hand, Langdon revelled in the spectacle as Shaw Snr vowed to expose the wizarding kind. When the dawn of 8 December came, Newton Scamander unleashed Frank the Thunderbird, who created a rainstorm laced with Swooping Evil venom, Obliviating all No-Majs' memories of magic, including Langdon's, who stood in the rain as his expression grew blank. 


== Personality and traits ==

Langdon Shaw was an excitable young man with a proclivity for wild ideas. He was frustrated by living in his elder brotherâ€™s shadow, and constantly tried to seek his father's approval and attention. He was also excited to try to show he had authority or power. Langdon appeared to have a tendency to drink too much alcohol.


== Relationships ==


=== Family ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Langdon with his father and brother 		 	 
Langdon's relationship with his father and brother seemed to be quite poor. His father Henry Shaw Senior saw him as a disappointment and was rather contemptuous of him, constantly dismissing Langdon and even refusing to listen to anything he said, including his belief in witchcraft, all the while favouring and praising his brother Henry Shaw Jr.
