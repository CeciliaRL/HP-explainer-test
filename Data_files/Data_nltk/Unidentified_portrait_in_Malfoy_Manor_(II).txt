This Portrait of a wizard hung in Malfoy Manor during 1997 and 1998, while the house was being used as Lord Voldemort's headquarters. The portrait witnessed the death of Charity Burbage and other meetings Lord Voldemort held with his Death Eaters.


== Behind the scenes ==
This portrait was based on that of Edward Sackville, 4th Earl of Dorset, c. 1614, by William Larkin (1580sâ€“1619).
The individual in this portrait may have died prior to 1997, because many portraits depict deceased individuals. In addition, the individual's clothing seems to support this.
It is possible that this individual is either Lucius Malfoy I or Brutus Malfoy.
