This individual (fl. 1792) was a Headteacher of Durmstrang Institute during the 1790s. 


== Biography ==
In 1792, the Triwizard Tournament was held at Hogwarts Castle, and this Headteacher and the Durmstrang student delegation travelled to Scotland, along with the Head of Bauxbatons, and were welcomed by the Head of Hogwarts. One of the tasks involved catching a Cockatrice, which went on a rampage and injured the judges, including the Durmstrang Head. This incident, along with the rising number of deaths, was a contributing factor to the eventual disbandment of the Tournament, though there were a few unsuccessful attempts to revive it.
