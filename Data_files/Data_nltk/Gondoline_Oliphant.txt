Gondoline Oliphant (1720-1799) was a British witch made famous for studying the life and habits of trolls.


== Biography ==
In 1799, she was clubbed to death in the Cotswolds while sketching. For her achievements in Magizoology, she was featured on a silver Famous Wizard card as part of the Chocolate Frog Card series.
There was a bust of her at Hogwarts Castle, on a secret passage leading from the fourth floor to the second floor.


== Etymology ==
The surname Oliphant is derived from an archaic English word for "elephant." J.R.R. Tolkien included huge, elephant-like creatures known as oliphaunts in his novel The Lord of the Rings.
The name Gondoline is perhaps a further nod to Tolkien: in the Silmarillion, there was an Elven city called Gondolin, which remained hidden for centuries before being destroyed.
