Bronwyn Trigg was a witch reported missing along with her relative, Harry Trigg, on the Potterwatch radio programme in 1997. Her disappearance was most likely linked to a Death Eater attack.


== Etymology ==
Bronwyn is an alternate spelling of Bronwen, a Welsh name derived from the elements bron, "breast", and gwen, "white, fair, blessed".


== Behind the scenes ==
This character is presumably a tribute to a relative of Derek Trigg, a foley editor who worked on every Harry Potter film, with the exception of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.


== Appearances ==
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (First mentioned)
