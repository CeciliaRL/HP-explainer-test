This unidentified goblin worked in the capacity of Head Goblin of Gringotts Wizarding Bank in the early 1990s.


== Biography ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			The Head Goblin at Gringotts 		 	 
On 31 July, 1991, this goblin summoned Griphook to aid Harry Potter and Rubeus Hagrid in performing their withdrawals in Gringotts.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is unknown if he was still employed at Gringotts, because he was not seen among the other Goblins when Harry and his friends broke into the bank on 1 May, 1998.
The Head Goblin was portrayed by Warwick Davis, who also portrayed Professor Filius Flitwick. Davis went on to play Griphook in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
This goblin's role in the story is replaced by Griphook in most video game adaptations.
Brady Dalton Richards, the actor portraying Scorpius Malfoy in the New York Lyric Theatre production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, also portrayed this particular goblin, voicing him when the cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child read aloud Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Chapter 5 (Diagon Alley) together, organised by Bloomsbury Publishing for the 2021 Harry Potter Book Night.
