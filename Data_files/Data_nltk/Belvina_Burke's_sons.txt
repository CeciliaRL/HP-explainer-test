Belvina Black married Herbert Burke, and they had three children: two sons and one daughter. They were all pure-blood and related through Belvina to the Black family.
These two wizards were grandsons of famous Phineas Nigellus Black, who was a Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They likely attended the school.
They had a sister.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is possible that one of the sons is Caractacus Burke, yet this is unconfirmed. However, this would mean that Caractacus could not possibly be the founder of Borgin and Burkes which would suggest that it was another relative; possibly Herbert Burke, that founded the shop.
