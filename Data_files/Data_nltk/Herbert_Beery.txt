Professor Herbert Beery was a wizard, who was a professor of Herbology at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when Armando Dippet was Headmaster. An enthusiastic devotee of amateur dramatics, Beery later left Hogwarts, sometime before Dippet left the post between 1965 and 1971, to teach at the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts (W.A.D.A).   


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Herbert Beery probably attended a wizarding school (possibly Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry), in his youth, and likely achieved a very high graded O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. in Herbology, as he later went on to teach the subject.  


=== Career at Hogwarts ===
At some point, Beery was employed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and became Professor of Herbology. Later, The Fountain of Fair Fortune fable was adapted into a pantomime by Professor Beery during the Yuletide for the students at Hogwarts. It resulted in a fire caused by an Engorged Ashwinder, and a duel involving the two lead actressesâ€”one of whom had been romantically involved with the lead actor until shortly before the curtain rose, and had been spurned in favour of the other.  
Beery was caught in the crossfire of the duel and spent the next few months with a disproportionately-sized head. He later confessed to Dumbledore that this confrontation caused his later productions to become as unlucky as the first. Soon after, he no longer wished to mount the performances due to the supposed bad luck which accompanied them and was replaced by Pomona Sprout. Beery soon left Hogwarts, sometime before Dippet left in the years 1965 to 1971, to teach at the Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts (W.A.D.A).

== Etymology ==
"Herbert" is derived from the Germanic elements hari "army" and beraht "bright". The Normans introduced this name to England, where it replaced an Old English cognate Herebeorht. In the course of the Middle Ages it became rare, but it was revived in the 19th century. The name "Herbert" may be a reference to the English word herb, referencing the subject he teaches.
