== Etymology ==
Heliotrope is a term used to describe a plant, which turns to face the sun, derived from the Greek helios, "sun", and tropein, "to turn." In the Language of flowers, heliotropes represent devotion. Miss Heliotrope is a character in The Little White Horse, a 1946 novel by Elizabeth Goudge, which was a childhood favourite of J. K. Rowling.
Wilkins is an English patronymic surname based on Wilkin, a nickname of the given names Will and William, which both derive from Wilhelm, a Germanic name made up of the elements wil, "will", and helm, "helmet". This was also the surname Hermione Granger chose, when she invented new identities for her parents, Mr and Mrs Granger, and sent them into hiding for safety's sake, during the Second Wizarding War.
