The two older brothers of Tertius (fl. 16th century) were Muggle brothers living somewhere in Scotland.


== Biography ==
When their parents died, these two brothers chased Tertius out of their house and broke his wand, afraid of him because he was a wizard. Sometime afterwards, Zygmunt Budge, who had heard this story from Tertius, sent these two Muggles a large bottle of Shrinking Solution by owl post, claiming it to be Butterbeer. This shrank them to the size of beetles and, according to the story Budge heard, spend the next few days hiding under their cupboard from their cat.
