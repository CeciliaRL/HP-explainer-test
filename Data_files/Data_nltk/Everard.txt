Professor Everard was one of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry's most celebrated Heads. His portrait hangs in the Headmaster's Office and in the Ministry of Magic's Headquarters.


== Biography ==


=== As Headmaster of Hogwarts ===
Everard was made Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in an unknown time period.


=== Post-mortem ===

After his death, he was remembered as one of the most celebrated Heads of Hogwarts.
When Arthur Weasley was attacked by Nagini in the Department of Mysteries in late 1995, Albus Dumbledore, then Headmaster, asked Everard to go to his portrait at the Ministry of Magic's Headquarters in order to warn others that Mr Weasley was injured at the Department.
In June 1997, following the Death Eater attack on Hogwarts and the death of Albus Dumbledore, he informed Professor Minerva McGonagall that Rufus Scrimgeour was on his way, having just disapparated from the Ministry of Magic.


== Etymology ==
The name "Everard" means "brave boar", derived from the Germanic elements eber, "wild boar" and hard, "brave", "hardy". The Normans introduced it to England, where it joined the Old English cognate Eoforheard. It has only been rarely used since the Middle Ages. Modern use of the name may be inspired by the surname Everard, itself derived from the medieval name.


== Behind the scenes ==
The style of clothing in his portrait suggests that he possibly lived in the 18th or 19th century.
Everard was portrayed by late Sam Beazley in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.
Everard is described as having short, black bangs in the novel, but Beazley portrays him as having greying hair.
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, he is shown to be holding a first-aid kit when Albus Dumbledore tells him to find the injured Arthur Weasley.
