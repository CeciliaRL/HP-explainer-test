Hengist Rawkes was a wizard depicted in a Portrait hanging near the first-floor landing of the Grand Staircase of Hogwarts Castle, near the portrait of a Count. His name could be read on a plaque hanging under his image.


== Behind the scenes ==
The portrait of Hengist Rawkes was based on a 1902 portrait of Thomas Lister, 4th Baron Ribblesdale, by John Singer Sargent (1856â€“1925).
This individual may have died sometime prior to 1991, as many portraits hung at Hogwarts Castle depict deceased individuals.


== Etymology ==
The name "Hengist" means "stallion" in Germanic. Hengist and his brother Horsa were the leaders of the first Germanic settlers in Britain. Hengist established a kingdom in Kent in the 5th century.
