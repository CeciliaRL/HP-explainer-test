Mrs Padgett was a British witch, the wife of Mr Padgett and the mother of Penelope Fawley (n√©e Padgett).


== Biography ==
During the Second Wizarding War, Mr and Mrs Padgett were both outspokenly supportive of Lord Voldemort and his Magic is Might Campaign; following the war, the latter was imprisoned in Azkaban for involving herself in the conflict. Before she was imprisoned, the last thing she gave her daughter was a Comet 290 broomstick, which was regarded as the only thing she was left with to remember her by.
When Penelope came to work in the Auror Office, Gethsemane Prickle was suspicious of her due to her parents' ties to the Death Eaters.
