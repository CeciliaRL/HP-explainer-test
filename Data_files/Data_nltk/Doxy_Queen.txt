The Doxy Queen was a female doxy who was served as the birthing mother and commander of many doxies who infested Hogwarts Castle in the 1990â€“1991 school year. She laid her eggs heavily in the Hogwarts kitchens.
Jacob's sibling and their friends sought to exterminate her in order to eliminate the doxy infestation that was plaguing Hogwarts. After failing to douse her in Doxycide in the kitchens, they found her again in the Prefect's Bathroom, where Jacob's sibling managed to kill her by using the Knockback Jinx to make her fall into a bath infused with the potion in the water.


== Behind the scenes ==
The characters in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery consider the best way to douse her in Doxycide is to directly pour the potion over her, which in fact proves to be highly impractical in the game, but also somewhat canonically strange, considering the potion is administered as a spray.
