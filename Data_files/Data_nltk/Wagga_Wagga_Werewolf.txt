The Wagga Wagga Werewolf was a werewolf, likely from Wagga Wagga in New South Wales, Australia.


== Biography ==
He was believed to have been vanquished by Gilderoy Lockhart by means of the Homorphus Charm, returning him to human form after letting out a piteous moan. It was actually an Armenian warlock who performed this feat, though Lockhart used a Memory Charm on him and took all the credit for the werewolfâ€™s defeat himself.
This werewolf was likely the subject of Lockhart's book Wanderings with Werewolves and was discussed by Lockhart during a second-year class during his time as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Lockhart asked Harry Potter to reenact the "defeat" of the werewolf as part of a lecture, in which Harry only reluctantly agreed to participate in order to have Lockhart sign a permission form for him to get a library book from the Restricted Section. For a homework assignment, he asked students to compose a poem about the werewolf's defeat, and would give signed copies of Magical Me to the best writers.
