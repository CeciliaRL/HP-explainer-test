Kenneth Hastings was an Australian wizard who played as a Chaser on the Australian National Quidditch team during the four-hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup, in 1994.
During the 1996–1997 school year, Hastings' Chocolate Frog Card could be won by beating Neville Longbottom at a duelling challenge.


== Etymology ==
The name "Kenneth" is the anglicised form of both Coinneach and Cináed. This name was borne by the Scottish king Kenneth (Cináed) mac Alpin, who united the Scots and Picts in the 9th century. It was popularised outside of Scotland by Sir Walter Scott, who used it for the hero in his novel The Talisman (1825). A famous bearer was the British novelist Kenneth Grahame (1859-1932), who wrote The Wind in the Willows.
