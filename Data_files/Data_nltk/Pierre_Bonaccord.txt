Pierre Bonaccord was a French wizard and the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards.


== Biography ==
Bonaccord wanted to ban troll-hunting and grant rights to trolls, possibly granting them full "being" status as opposed to them being classified as "beasts". However, a tribe of Mountain Trolls had been causing a lot of trouble in Liechtenstein, so their wizarding community contested Bonaccord's appointment, and refused to join the Confederation as a result.


== Etymology ==
"Pierre" is a French form of Peter. This name was also borne by Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841-1919), a French impressionist painter, and by Pierre Curie (1859-1906), a physicist who discovered radioactivity with his wife Marie.
A "bon-accord" is an expression or token of good will.
