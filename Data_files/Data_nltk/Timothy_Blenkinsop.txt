Timothy Blenkinsop (born c. 1976) was a Quidditch fan who supported Puddlemere United. He was twenty-three when he attended a match between Puddlemere United and the Holyhead Harpies on 30 September, 1999. These two teams had long been rivals, and, anticipating the possibility of crowd violence, the Ministry of Magic confiscated wands at the gates. However, many attendees turned over fake wands. Thus, when Wilda Griffiths, a Chaser for Puddlemere United who transferred from the Harpies earlier that year, disappeared mid-match, a riot broke out, and people were able to use their real wands. Timothy got caught in the crossfire, and was left with a tail because of it, presumably due to a spell that hit him.


== Etymology ==
The name "Timothy" is from the Greek name Τιμοθεος (Timotheos) meaning "honouring God", derived from τιμαω (timao) "to honour" and θεος (theos) "god". As an English name, Timothy was not used until after the Protestant Reformation.
