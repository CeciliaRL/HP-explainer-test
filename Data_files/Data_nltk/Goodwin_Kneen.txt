Goodwin Kneen (fl. 12th century) was an English wizard who lived in Yorkshire, England, in the twelfth century. A Kwidditch player (a forerunner to the modern game of Quidditch), a letter he once wrote to his Norwegian cousin Olaf demonstrates the spread of the sport throughout Great Britain.


== Biography ==

Kneen lived with Gunhilda in Yorkshire some time around the mid-twelfth century. He also had a cousin in Norway, Olaf, which seemed to be an occasional correspondent of his.
Kneen played "Kwidditch" along with his wife Gunhilda (who played "Catcher"), Ugga (who played Beater) and Radulf (a reserve "Catcher").
On a match against a team from Ilkley, on a Saturday night, Kneen's team scored forty-two times and won. This match was crucial for the introduction of goal posts in modern Quidditch, as they introduced "new scoring barrels", three on each end of the pitch on stilts, given to them by Oona, a innkeeper. Following the match, Oona offered the team free mead all night. Gunhilda was not pleased with the late hour of his return home, and he had to "duck a couple of nasty jinxes", ending up with his fingers temporarily jinxed off.
Later that same week, Kneen wrote a letter by owl to his cousin Olaf, relaying the match. This eight-hundred-year old letter is preserved in the Norwegian Ministry of Magic archives as an important artefact about the evolution of the game.
