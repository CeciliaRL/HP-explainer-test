== Etymology ==
The name Günther is from the Germanic name Gundahar, derived from the elements gund "war" and hari "army, warrior". This was the name of a semi-legendary 5th-century Burgundian king. He appears in the Germanic saga the Nibelungenlied which has him married to the Icelandic queen Brünhild.
