== Biography ==
Noted for their eccentricity, the twins preferred to keep to themselves, living alone together in a mansion their whole lives. After they died, their relatives found that their home contained duplicates of every item inside, down to the set of hand-written instructions for the Doubling Charm that each twin left on one of the matching tables in the kitchen.
