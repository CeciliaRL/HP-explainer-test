Urg the Unclean (fl. 18th century) was a goblin rebel who became notorious for having led the 18th century Goblin Rebellions.


== Biography ==
At some point in his life he was publicly dunked in a village pond by a group of young wizards. This event precipitated one of the bloody rebellions in which Urg himself was the dissident leader. For his role in the Goblin Rebellions, he was featured on one Chocolate Frog Card.
When Ron Weasley sat his fourth year History of Magic final, he forgot some of the names of the goblin rebels, and thus invented a few as cover, stating that this was easy because "they're all called stuff like Bodrod the Bearded and Urg the Unclean."
