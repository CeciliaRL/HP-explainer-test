Harry Trigg was a wizard reported missing along with his relative, Bronwyn, on the Potterwatch radio programme in 1997. His disappearance was linked to a Death Eater attack.

This character is presumably a tribute to a relative of Derek Trigg, a foley editor who worked on every Harry Potter film, excepting Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.
