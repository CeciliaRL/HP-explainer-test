This wizard is the only known person to successfully kill a Chimaera. It is unknown how he did so other then that he rode a winged horse during the conflict, and that he died shortly afterward from collapsing off his horse from exhaustion.


== Behind the scenes ==
This character is most likely a reference to Bellerophon, an ancient Greek hero who defeated the mythical Chimaera from the back of the winged horse Pegasus. He also collapsed from his steed after the encounter, but not from exhaustion; he felt that his defeat of the Chimaera was enough to earn him a place among the gods, and attempted to fly to Mount Olympus. He was stopped by Zeus, who sent a gadfly to bite Pegasus and make Bellerophon fall off. Furthermore, he did not die from the fall, but was merely injured enough to live out the rest of his days as a blinded, crippled hermit.
