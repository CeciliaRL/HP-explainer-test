These three unidentified individuals (fl. 1995) were wizards and Aurors for the British Ministry of Magic.


== Biography ==


=== 1995 ===
In June of 1995, these wizards came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry along with John Dawlish and Dolores Umbridge in an attempt to forcibly remove Rubeus Hagrid from both his teaching position and his home. When he refused to leave, they attempted to stun him with several Stunning Spells, but he managed to resist their spells. Minerva McGonagall protested angrily against them for their excessive force, for which they retaliated by assaulting her with four stunning spells, resulting in her being hospitalised in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries for her injuries. Furious at such a cowardly attack, Hagrid attacked two of them in a blind rage, knocking them both unconscious before escaping, with the remaining one too frightened to approach the enraged Hagrid.
