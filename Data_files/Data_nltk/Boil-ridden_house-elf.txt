This male house-elf worked for Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry as one of their staff of house-elves. He apparently had skin problems, as the house-elf had developed a terrible case of boils. A Hogwarts student, using the advice of the spirit of Zygmunt Budge possessing Book of Potions, brewed a Cure for Boils potion that remedied this elf's skin affliction.
