Moribund was the shopkeeper of Moribund's, in Knockturn Alley. The shop is the neighbouring shop of The Spiny Serpent and is opposite Borgin and Burkes. The shop's door is kept locked at all times, despite the shop being open. This allows Moribund to have a select customer market. As the forebear of shopkeeper Garrick Ollivander did in the case of Ollivanders, Moribund chose to give his establishment the family name. The shop is lit by candle light and has a rather messy exterior.
