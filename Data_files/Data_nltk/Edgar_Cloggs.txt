Edgar Cloggs was a ghost who was often found hanging around the Quidditch pitch at Hogwarts for as long as anyone could remember. He was willing to help the Hogwarts Quidditch teams to practise. By the year of 1993, he was also included on a Chocolate Frog Card, for his achievements in the sport.


== Etymology ==
Derived from the Old English elements ead "rich, blessed" and gar "spear". This was the name of a 10th century English king who is regarded as a saint. The name did not survive long after the Norman conquest, but it was revived in the 18th century, in part due to a character by this name in Sir Walter Scott's novel 'The Bride of Lammermoor' (1819). Famous bearers include author and poet Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849), French impressionist painter Edgar Degas (1834-1917), and author Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950).
