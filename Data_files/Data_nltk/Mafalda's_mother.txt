The mother of Mafalda was a Muggle woman. She was married to an estranged second cousin of Molly Weasley.


== Behind the scenes ==
J. K. Rowling has revealed that Mafalda and her parents were characters she once planned to include in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. After discovering their daughter was a witch, Mafalda's parents were supposed to visit the Weasley family, hoping that they would help introduce her to the wizarding world. However, Rowling ultimately decided to cut Mafalda out of the plot, thus calling into question the canonicity of her and her parents.
