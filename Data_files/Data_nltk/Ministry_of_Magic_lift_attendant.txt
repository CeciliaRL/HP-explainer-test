This individual (fl. 1995) was a wizard who worked for Magical Maintenance at the Ministry of Magic in the capacity of lift attendant in the mid-1990s.


== Biography ==
He was noticeably bored during the course of his job on the morning of 12 August, on which day he was operating the lift that carried Harry Potter and Arthur Weasley down into Level 9 and Courtroom Ten.
By 1997, during Lord Voldemort's puppet regime, there were no attendants operating the lifts, so it is possible this individual either quit his job or was sacked for his blood status.
