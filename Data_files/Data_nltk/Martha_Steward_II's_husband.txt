This man was a member of the Pocomtuc people during the 17th century. He had at least one sibling, who was friends with Martha Steward, the Squib daughter of Isolt Sayre and James Steward. He was known to be non-magical, but it is unknown whether he was a No-Maj with a No-Maj-born sibling, or a Squib born to wizard parents. He eventually married Martha, and she subsequently integrated into No-Maj society.
