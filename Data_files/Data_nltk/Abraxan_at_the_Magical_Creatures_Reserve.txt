During the late 1980s, this Abraxan lived on the Grasslands in the Magical Creatures Reserve, and Jacob's sibling would often bond with and feed this Abraxan. As a part of Rubeus Hagrid's research on Abraxans, it was brought to Hogwarts grounds, but became afraid of its own shadows. Jacob's sibling and Penny Haywood soothed it and gave it a bucket of single-malt whiskey. They ended up finishing the research with Hagrid in the Reserve.
