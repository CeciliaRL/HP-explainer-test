These sinister-looking monks were depicted in a picture hung at Hogwarts Castle. Their portrait hung at the top of the Divination Stairwell in the North Tower, close to the Divination Classroom. Sir Cadogan bade farewell to Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger through this portrait, after leading the trio along the long corridor to the Divination Classroom.
