This ghoul was, at one point, living in one of 12 Grimmauld Place's bathrooms. Though most ghouls are simple-minded and peaceful, this one was described as "murderous" and was considerably more of a threat than normal. During their cleansing of the house in the summer of 1995, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Sirius Black and the Weasleys came across this ghoul. They managed to get rid of it with the assistance of Nymphadora Tonks, who was visiting that day.
