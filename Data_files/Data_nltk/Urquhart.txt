Urquhart was a wizard and student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s, who was a member of Slytherin house.


== Biography ==
During the 1996â€“1997 school year, he was the Captain of the Slytherin Quidditch team. Urquhart was new to the squad and he had not held any position on the team before, so it seemed odd that he was made the Captain, playing as a Chaser. During the match against Gryffindor, Urquhart shook hands with Harry, 'crushing it'.
