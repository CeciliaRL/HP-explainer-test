A group of Muggle workmen were out drinking at pubs on Tottenham Court Road on the night of 1 August, 1997. They spotted Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger that night, just after the trio Disapparated from the Burrow after the Death Eaters took over the Ministry of Magic. The men wolf-whistled at Hermione, and one drunkenly asked her to go get a drink with him. She ignored him, and entered a café with Harry and Ron.


== Behind the scenes ==
After the trio unwittingly triggered the Taboo on Lord Voldemort's name, they were tracked by Death Eaters Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle, who disguised themselves as workmen and followed Harry, Ron, and Hermione into the café, where a brief skirmish ensued. It is possible that they incapacitated or killed the drunk workers in order to obtain the disguises, a theory which is supported by the detail of their existence being added at all.
