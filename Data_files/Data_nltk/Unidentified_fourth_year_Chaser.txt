== Biography ==
This individual started attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1986 and was Sorted into the same house as Jacob's sibling.
By their fourth year, the individual had become a Chaser on their Quidditch team. During their fourth year, they fell three storeys off their broom and broke their nose. Because of this, they ended up in the Hospital Wing. Shortly after this incident, Poppy Pomfrey was petrified, and the Chaser left the Hospital Wing as it was evacuated.


== Behind the scenes ==
This individual's house is the same as that of Jacob's sibling, which is chosen by the player.
This is similar to how characters in the Quidditch storyline (such as Skye Parkin) are in specific houses depending on the player's house. As such, it is possible this character will eventually appear as a teammate in a yet to be released Quidditch Season.
