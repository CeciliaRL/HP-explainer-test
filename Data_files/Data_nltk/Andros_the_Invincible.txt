Andros the Invincible was a celebrated Ancient Greek wizard who, reportedly, was able to conjure a Patronus as big as a giant — the only Patronus of such size ever recorded.


== Biography ==


=== Lifetime ===
Andros was born in Greece, in the Classical antiquity. At some point, he mastered wandless spellcasting as well as the Patronus Charm. His corporeal Patronus was claimed to be the size of a Giant, although whether its form was in fact a Giant or some other gigantic form is unclear. In recognition of his skill in wizardry, he earned the epithet 'the Invincible'.


=== Post-mortem ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Andros immortalised on a silver Chocolate Frog Card 		 	 
By the 1990s, Andros was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card, which recorded his wizarding skills and depicted him conjuring his famous Patronus wandlessly.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Charms: Andros was evidently very accomplished with charms, as he was able to produce a corporeal Patronus (a very advanced and difficult charm) to the size of a giant.
Wandless magic: Andros was also capable of producing his incredibly large Patronus without using a wand, showing him to him to have been a very powerful wizard to have been able to produce such an advanced charm without a wand.


== Behind the scenes ==
Although Andros was featured on a famous wizard card, it is known that the size and corporeal form of a Patronus has no influence upon its power. In fact, another famous Patronus, belonging to Illyius, took the form of a little mouse, but was still of immense power.


== Etymology ==
The word Anēr, of which Andros is the genitive form, is Ancient Greek for "man". The word is currently used as a prefix in many non-Greek words. It is also the name of a Greek island (Andros), an Atlantic island, and several fictional characters in franchises such as Power Rangers, Sandman and Marvel Comics.
