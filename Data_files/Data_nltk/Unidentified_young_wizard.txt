This young man was a wizard who lived during the Middle Ages. Leticia Somnolens, the local Hag, was jealous of the King's daughter and tricked her into pricking her finger on a spindle tainted with Draught of Living Death, sending her into a deep sleep. This young wizard smeared his lips with Wiggenweld Potion, and then kissed the princess, curing her and bringing her out of the sleep. His story appears to be the source of inspiration for the Muggle fairy tale, Sleeping Beauty.
