This individual was the Headteacher of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1790s.


== Biography ==
In 1792, the Triwizard Tournament was held at Hogwarts Castle, and this Headteacher welcomed the Head of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang to Scotland. One of the tasks involved catching a Cockatrice, which went on a rampage and injured the judges, including the Hogwarts Head. This incident, along with the rising number of deaths during the tournament, was a contributing factor to the eventual termination of the Tournament, though there were a few unsuccessful attempts to revive it.
