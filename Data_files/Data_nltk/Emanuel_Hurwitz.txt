Emanuel Hurwitz (7 May, 1919 â€” 19 November, 2006) was a British Muggle violinist who lead several orchestras and ensembles.
On Sunday, 7 May in a year prior to 1997, at 7:30 in the evening, Emanuel and his wife, Kay, a violist, gave a performance of Mozart's Sinfonia Concertanti at St. Mary's Church Hall. The performance was directed by Alec Webb, and the Dollis Chamber Ensemble accompanied the couple for the first time ever. Hermione Granger had a poster for this concert stuck up on the bulletin board in her bedroom in the Granger family's house.

In real life, Emanuel and Kay Hurwitz are, respectively, the stepgrandfather and grandmother of Miraphora Mina, a graphic artist who worked on all eight Harry Potter films. Mina likely created the prop concert poster featured in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 as a tribute to them.
