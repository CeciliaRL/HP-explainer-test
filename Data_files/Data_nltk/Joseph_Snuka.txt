Joseph Snuka was a Fijian wizard who played as the Seeker for the 2014 Fijian National Quidditch team.


== Biography ==
During the second match of the 427th Quidditch World Cup, against Nigeria, Snuka chose to capture the Snitch in the 141st minute, when his team was losing 400 to 10, much to the bewilderment of the commentators, the fury of the Fijian supporters and the jeers of the Nigerians.
Snuka had previously been dubbed an egoist by teammates, and his reputation was only tarnished further with his actions during the match. After the match, Fijian manager and trainer Hector Bolobolo's only comment was "I'm going to kill him".


== Personality and traits ==
Snuka was, according to his teammates, an egoist, and was therefore likely very vain, confident and self-centred.


== Etymology ==
"Joseph" comes from the Latin "Ioseph", which translates, through a variety of translations, to the Hebrew name "Yosef", meaning "he will add". Joseph was a common biblical name in both Christian and Jewish societies.
