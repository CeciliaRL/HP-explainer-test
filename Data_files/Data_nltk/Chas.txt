Chas was an individual mentioned in a book kept in the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts Library by the 1990s.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the shrieking book appears to be a copy of The Works of the Most Reverend Dr John Tillotson. As an Easter Egg, it seems someone in the special effects department digitally replaced some of the book's original text with names: "Laura and Chas" (left page, bottom paragraph), "Terry Michelle Chloe and Aimee" (middle right page), "Debbie Amy and Leon" (right page, bottom paragraph).
