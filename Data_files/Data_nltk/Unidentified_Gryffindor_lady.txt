This lady was a witch who, in her lifetime, was Head of Gryffindor House. A portrait of her hung in Gryffindor Tower.
In 1994, when Harry Potter opened his golden egg, her portrait was terrified of the sound and was seen holding her hands over her ears. In 1995, she asked Hermione Granger to fetch a House-elf so it could clean her frame. Hermione gave her a lecture on S.P.E.W.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, she was credited as "GCR Portrait Female 1", and was voiced by Isobel Middleton. Her portrait also appears in the Gryffindor Common Room in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, but does not speak.
