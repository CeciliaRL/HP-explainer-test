Laurena Kama (fl. 1896) was a French pure-blood witch, wife to Mustafa Kama and the coerced wife of Corvus Lestrange. She was the mother of both Yusuf Kama and Leta Lestrange.


== Biography ==
Hailing from a pure-blood family and happily married to the Senegalese pure-blood Mustafa Kama, Laurena was put under the Imperius Curse by Corvus Lestrange and forced to bear a daughter with him. Laurena died after giving birth to Leta Lestrange.


== Behind the scenes ==
Laurena Kama is played by Isaura Barb√©-Brown in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.
Though her marriage to Corvus was not directly stated, it is strongly implied by Yusuf's words that Corvus "remarried not three months after her death".
Her second marriage can be seen as similar to that of Merope Riddle and Tom Riddle Snr. Both Laurena and Riddle Senior were forced into marriage and did not rear the resultant children. Riddle Senior abandoned his son, Tom Riddle, whereas Laurena died giving birth, possibly similar to Merope who died an hour after giving birth.
It is also noteworthy that Corvus used the Imperius Curse as opposed to a love potion as to prevent any ill effects on his daughter.
