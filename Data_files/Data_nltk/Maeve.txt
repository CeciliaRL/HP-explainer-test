== Behind the scenes ==
Her title may indicate she was Muggle-born or Half-blood, as Remus Lupin mentioned there are no princes in the wizarding world and thus, probably no queens or it means that she married a muggle king.


== Etymology ==
The name "Maeve" is the anglicised form of the Gaelic name Medb meaning "intoxicating". In Irish legend this was the name of a warrior queen of Connacht. Her fight against Ulster and the hero CÃºchulainn is told in the Irish epic 'The Cattle Raid of Cooley'.
