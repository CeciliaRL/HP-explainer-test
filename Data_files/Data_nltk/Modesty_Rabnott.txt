Madam Modesty Rabnott was a British witch who lived in Kent in the 13th century.


== Biography ==
Rabnott attended the game of Cuaditch (Quidditch) in 1269 where Chief of the Wizards' Council Barberus Bragge released a Golden Snidget onto the pitch. Appalled by the treatment of the bird, Rabnott protested to Chief Bragge, but he laughed at her. Using the Summoning Charm to call the bird to her, Madam Rabnott stuffed the Snidget down the front of her robes and fled. Although she was caught, she managed to release the Snidget into the wild. While she feared that Chief Bragge would turn her into a horned toad, she was fined only ten Galleons instead. Not able to afford the fine, she lost her house. Fortunately, however, they did not take her hippogriff, allowing her to fly to Aberdeen to stay with her sister, Prudence.
The Modesty Rabnott Snidget Reservation was named in her honour by Elfrida Clagg when she banned the use of the Golden Snidget in Quidditch in the following century.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Charms: According to herself, Madam Rabnott was very good at aiming at targets with the Summoning Charm, and during the 1269 Quidditch match, she was able to successfully summon the Golden Snidget used in the match, showing her proficiency in this field of magic.
Care of Magical Creatures: Madam Rabnott owned a pet Hippogriff, which she used to fly to Aberdeen with to live with her sister. This means she was skilled with the handling of magical creatures, given how the Hippogriff is a rather difficult beast to tame.


== Etymology ==
The name "Modesty" comes from the English word modesty, ultimately from Latin modestus "moderate", a derivative of modus "measure".


== Behind the scenes ==
Modesty Rabnott is the favourite of Andrew Lincoln, who narrated the 2018 audio edition of Quidditch Through the Ages; he believes she deserved her own spin-off series, worthy of a docudrama.
