Warren G. Harding (born 2 November 1865) was an American No-Maj politician who belonged to the Republican Party. He served as the President of the United States of America from 4 March 1921 to an unknown date.
In its 6 December 1926 issue, the New York Chronicle reported that President Harding had delivered an in-person address before the U.S. Congress that day, challenging opponents of the Ship Subsidy Bill to work to defeat it instead of ignoring it because "the failure of Congress to act decisively [would] be no less disastrous than adverse action."


== Behind the scenes ==
Warren G. Harding died on 2 August 1923 of a cerebral haemorrhage while serving his first term as president. This makes the multiple references to President Harding in articles in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them anachronistic, as the film is set in December 1926, three years after Harding's death in office. However, it can be presumed that Harding did not die in 1923 in the Harry Potter universe, and that he was elected to a second term.
The text of the articles mentioning Harding in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle were taken from the real 21 November 1922 issue of The Evening World and document actual historical events (albeit anachronistically).
