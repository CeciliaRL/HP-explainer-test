Jeremiah Garnet was a British wizard and radio reporter for the Wizarding Wireless Network.


== Biography ==
He was investigating a fire at the Boathouse of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and believed it to be caused by a dragon. His zealousness to develop this story led him to fake a photograph of a dragon flying over Hogwarts. This forgery was discovered by Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner during their investigation of the fire.
Garnet managed to capture the beast responsible for the fire and sent it to the Wizarding Wireless Network for an exclusive report, but Mathilda and her partner managed to rescue the beast and relocate it.
In addition to reporting, Garnet was also working on Hogwarts Castle: A History of Cultivated Fungus.
