Sir Google Flange was a wizard who lived during the 17th century.


== Biography ==
Google Flange lived during the early 17th century. At some point in his lifetime, he was knighted, thus earning the title "Sir."
He died in or before 1991. A portrait of him, dated 1600 and featuring the word "abracadabra" written in the shape of triangle, was hung at Hogwarts Castle sometime after his death. In the 1990s, it was hanging in the Grand Staircase, near the Third-floor corridor.


== Behind the scenes ==
The portrait of Google Flange was based on a 1628 portrait of Charles I of England by Gerard van Honthorst.
Writing the word "abracadabra" repeatedly to form a triangle, as it appears in the portrait, is an ancient mystical practise. Quintus Serenus Sammonicus, a third century A.D. Roman physician, advised people afflicted with malaria to wear amulets bearing such an inscription, claiming it warded off disease.
At The Making of Harry Potter, the portrait of Poderick Crookshank was erroneously put in a frame inscribed "Sir Google Flange," but Crookshank was correctly identified in The Paintings of Hogwarts: Masterpieces from the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Sets.
