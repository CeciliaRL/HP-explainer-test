Professor Eupraxia Mole was Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1870s.


== Biography ==
In 1876, caretaker Rancorous Carpe devised an "elaborate trap" in an effort to remove Peeves, the resident Poltergeist, from the Castle, which failed. The Castle had to be evacuated for three days as Peeves amused himself by firing weapons randomly and threatening the students with death.
Professor Mole agreed to sign a contract with Peeves, so that he relinquished the weapons in exchange for additional privileges: a once-weekly swim in the boys' toilets on the ground floor, first refusal on stale bread from the kitchen for throwing purposes, as well as a new custom-made hat by Madame Bonhabille.
