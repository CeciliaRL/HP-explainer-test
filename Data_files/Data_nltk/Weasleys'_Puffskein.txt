This Puffskein belonged to the Weasley family in the early 1990s. He was kept in the family's Puffskein patch, where his favourite delicacies included wild bushes. Sometime before 1992, Fred Weasley, along with his twin brother George, used the family's Puffskein as a Bludger during Quidditch practice. Ginevra Weasley would in her youth look after the creature in its patch to make sure the twins did not do it again.
In August, 1992, the Puffskein swallowed Ginny's Remembrall, and escaped to a small forest area. Ginny followed it and got lost, only to be found along with the Puffskein by Harry Potter.
