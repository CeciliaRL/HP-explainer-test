Amorette Deneuve was a witch and the foremost expert on love potions and spells; she had many published works about Love, among them, First Love, First Loss.
Even though he was originally of the opinion that Deneuve's work was "sentimental blather", Grim Fawley contacted Amorette Deneuve following the disappearance of his wife, Penelope.


== Behind the scenes ==
Shortly after the outbreak of the Calamity and the establishment of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, Gareth Greengrass commented on an article in the Quibbler with the headline; "The Unspeakables Expand in Secret! What Are They Hiding?", and confirmed the truth of it, saying; "We had a 143 year old retire because he kept forgetting everything - literally, everything. Another member wanted to go and write novels. So, we replaced them both - with Grim and Regina Rowle." Considering that Amorette specialises in love, a topic studied in the Department of Mysteries, it is possible that she is this second member they replaced, and that the content of her books pertains at least partially to declassified research material from back then.
