This boy slew the giant mercenary Goliath using only a catapult during the war between the Israelites and Philistines in Biblical times.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the book 1 Samuel of the Old Testament, King David slays the giant Goliath with a slingshot as a child, but the Chocolate Frog Card for Goliath only refers to the giant's slayer as a "young boy" and does not explicitly name David. This may have to do with the fact that in 2 Samuel, Elhanan, son of Jair is credited for killing Goliath, rather than David. Alternatively, the producers of the game in which the card appears may have wished to avoid naming David to avoid offending religious sensibilities.
Giants in the Harry Potter universe are said to be between twenty and twenty five feet tall. According to a common interpretation of the Bible, Goliath was about 9 feet 9 inches, making him extremely short by giant standards (but still taller than the tallest recorded human), suggesting that he may have been a Half-giant. Other interpretations place his height at about 6 feet 7 inches, a more realistic height for a human who was still extremely tall by the standards of the time, making the term "Giant" descriptive.
Though David's weapon is sometimes depicted as a catapult, historically it was more likely to have been a sling weapon.
