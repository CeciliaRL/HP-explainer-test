== Biography ==


=== 1990–1991 school year ===

 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Twycross giving Jacob's sibling their visitor badge at the British Ministry of Magic 		 	 
During the 1990–1991 school year, Twycross was the supervisor of the Ministry of Magic student programme for seventh-year students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Before the students' first assignments, he gave them a lecture on the Rules of Conduct for Students Visiting the Ministry of Magic. Later, he met Jacob's sibling, a student who arrived late, taught them the rules of conduct and gave them a visitor badge for their credentials.


=== 1996–1997 school year ===

 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Twycross teaching sixth years Apparition in the Great Hall, 1997 		 	 
During the 1996–1997 school year, Twycross would give sixth-year students Apparition classes in the Great Hall at Hogwarts. Upon meeting Twycross, Harry Potter described him as "oddly colourless, with transparent eyelashes, wispy hair, and an insubstantial air, as though a single gust of wind might blow him away." He wondered whether this was because of the large amount of Apparating and Disapparating he did. 
Many of the sixth year students in Twycross's Apparition class disliked and called him various insults, inspired by the "Three D's of Apparition" that he tried to teach them. The most moderate of these were "dog-breath" and "dung-head." Perhaps because of this, Twycross seemed very fond of his few good students, such as Hermione Granger.


== Magical abilities and skills ==

Apparition: As the Apparition Instructor for sixth year Hogwarts students, Twycross would have been highly accomplished in apparition as a form of magical transportation. He had a very sophisticated understanding of the art of apparition, teaching his students the specifics needed to apparate successfully and the dangers of it, showing his proficiency in this field.
Transfiguration: Twycross was able to conjure wooden hoops during an Apparition lesson in the Great Hall simply with a wave of his wand. Conjuration was known to be a particularly difficult branch of transfiguration.
Nonverbal magic: Twycross was able to conjure hoops without saying an incantation, which is very advanced magic.


== Etymology ==
Wilkie is a surname used in Scotland and England possibly a diminutive of William. Twycross is a small village and civil parish in Leicestershire, England. Also twy- is an archaic form of two so his surname could literally mean two-cross, or one who crosses between two places; hence, one who Apparates.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is most likely that Twycross worked for the Department of Magical Transportation, given his profession as an Apparition Instructor.
It is interesting to note that Rowling was reading Wilkie Collins' The Moonstone when she was writing Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, so it is possible that it is where she got the name.
