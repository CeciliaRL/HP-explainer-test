== Etymology ==
The name Harfang may be derived from Harfang des neiges, a French term for "snowy owl." In The Silver Chair, the sixth book in the The Chronicles of Narnia series by C.S. Lewis, Harfang is a city of giants in the far north.
J.R.R Tolkien, the author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, gave the name Longbottom to one of the Hobbits' villages in the Shire, which is known for its pipe-weed.
