The Sea Serpent of Cromer was a sea serpent which lived off the coast of Cromer, Norfolk. It was slain by Glanmore Peakes during the early eighteenth century.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is never revealed why Peakes slayed the Sea Serpent of Cromer, as Sea Serpents are regarded as docile creatures that pose no threat to humans (despite hysterical Muggle accounts of their ferocious behaviour). It could be that this particular serpent had an unusually aggressive demeanour, or that it wasn't strictly a Sea Serpent, but rather an aggressive relative, like the Selma.
