== Biography ==


=== 1987–1988 school year ===
In the 1987–1988 school year, he stayed near the entrance of the Forest Vault, as he could easily prey on the sleepwalking students approaching him and devour their flesh. Thankfully, the centaur Torvus sent the students back to the castle before the foul beast could get a chance to devour a student. Jacob's sibling, when they ventured into the forest to find out the truth surrounding the vault, came across the Acromantula, and attacked him with magic, before finally defeating him with Arania Exumai, stunning him and sending him fleeing back to his colony.
After the Forest Vault had been broken into, the Acromantula went rogue and barged into the Red Cap's Hole, forcing the Red Cap that lived there to leave. The Acromantula stuck Charlie Weasley to the ground with his web, but was confronted by Jacob's sibling, who fought him again. He was then convinced to return back to the colony. When he reunited with the other Acromantulas, they decided to eat the students after all and attacked them, and before they lost control, Hagrid came holding his crossbow, which drove the Acromantulas away.


=== 1988–1989 school year ===
At the start of the 1988–1989 school year, Jacob's sibling and another student returned to the Spider's Lair and fought the Acromantula in order to find Beatrice Haywood.
Later during this school year, Jacob's sibling and Nymphadora Tonks returned to face an Acromantula to get some of its venom to give Mundungus Fletcher in order to get more information about the Marauder's Map from him. It is likely that this was the Acromantula they fought.


=== 1989–1990 school year ===
It was possibly this Acromantula that Ben Copper would often taunt and attack during the 1989–1990 school year to become braver.
