This unidentified female Chinese Fireball was the dragon Viktor Krum had to get past in the First Task of the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. Krum used the Conjunctivitis Curse on the dragon in his attempt to capture the golden egg. However, in its agony, the Fireball stomped around, squashing half of its real eggs and causing Krum to have points deducted by the judges.
