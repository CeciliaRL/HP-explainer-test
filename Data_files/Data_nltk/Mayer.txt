Mayer was an American No-Maj who worked as a detective for the New York Police Department in the 1920s.


== Biography ==
On 6 December 1926, Mayer and fellow detective Brown arraigned John Haas and William Friend in the Centre Street Police Court for the crime of defrauding the Columbia Bank of $121,000. Haas worked for the bank as a bookkeeper prior to his 2 December dismissal. Mayer and Brown stated they had never seen such a "slovenly, almost unbelievably simple" system of forging accounting records to hide fraud as that used by Haas and Friend. The case was reported in the 6 December 1926 issue of the New York Chronicle.


== Behind the scenes ==
The text of the article mentioning Mayer in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was taken from the real 21 November 1922 issue of The Evening World. This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in 1926, but the actual events referenced occurred in 1922.
