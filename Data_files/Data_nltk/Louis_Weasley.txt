== Etymology ==
The name "Louis" is the French form of Ludovicus, the Latinised form of Ludwig. From Old German hlod and wig, meaning "fame" and "warrior". The king Clovis I (5th century) was the first Christian king in France. This was the name of eighteen kings of France, starting with Louis I, the son of Charlemagne (8th century), and including Louis IX (Saint Louis), who led two crusades, and Louis XIV (the 'Sun King'), who was the ruler of France during the height of its power, the builder of the Palace of Versailles, and the longest reigning monarch in the history of Europe.
