Lady Carmilla Sanguina (1561-1757) was an infamous vampire who bathed in the blood of her victims, believing it would retain her youth and beauty.


== Etymology ==
The surname Sanguina is derived from the Latin sanguineus, which means "of blood," "bloody," or "bloodthirsty."


== Behind the scenes ==
Lady Sanguina may have been been inspired by Erzsébet Báthory, a 16th-century Hungarian countess who was accused of killing young women, then bathing in their blood.
Carmilla is a Gothic 19th-century novel written by Sheridan Lefanu and starring a female vampire with that name. The story has been adapted to cinema and comic-books, with the character (or similar characters with the same name) appearing in other franchises.
