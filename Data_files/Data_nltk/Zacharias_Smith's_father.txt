Mr Smith was the father of Zacharias Smith. He collected his son from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry following the death of Albus Dumbledore in 1997. He did not attend the funeral, perhaps suggesting that he was not a supporter of Dumbledore, a concept in keeping with his son's knack for making enemies. He was described as being a haughty-looking man.
