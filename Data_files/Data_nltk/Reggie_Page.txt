Born and raised somewhere in the British Isles, Reggie was the elder son of a Muggle father and a witch mother. He had a sister and a younger brother, Daniel Page. Unlike Daniel, he wasn't born with any magical abilities. He attended a Muggle primary school.
His father was involved in illicit activities and in due time, he joined in. At some point, they were eventually caught by the Muggle police and arrested. His mother tried to intervene using magic so they could escape, scaring the police and violating the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.
While they were tried and sentenced to a Muggle prison, her violation of the Statute of Secrecy led to her being sentenced to Azkaban. The family's arrest was covered by a Muggle newspaper, dubbing them "The Bloody Pages".
