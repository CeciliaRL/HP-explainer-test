The devil is an entity believed in many religions (notably Christianity and Islam) to be the embodiment of evil and the enemy of humankind.
In certain Christian traditions, the devil was said to have once been an angel named Lucifer, cast out of heaven for disobeying God. The story of Lucifer's fall was covered in the book The Hierarchie of the Blessed Angells.
The Fat Lady described Sirius Black as having "eyes like the devil" after he attacked her portrait in 1993.
