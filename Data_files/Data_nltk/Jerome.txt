Jerome (c. 27 March 347 â€“ 30 September 420) was an Ancient Roman priest, theologian, and historian, best known for producing the Vulgate, an early Latin translation of the Bible. He was venerated as a saint in the Catholic, Anglican, and Eastern Orthodox churches.
St Jerome's Church in Godric's Hollow was presumably named after him.
