== Biography ==
During the third match of the 427th Quidditch World Cup, Haiti versus Brazil, Hyppolite scored eight of the total nine of his team's goals. Hyppolite's performance, however, did not stop the team from being disqualified after Beater Jean-Baptiste Bloncourt illegally captured the Snitch.
