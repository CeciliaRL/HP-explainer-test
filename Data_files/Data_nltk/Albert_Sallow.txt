Albert Sallow was a British wizard who worked at the British Ministry of Magic in the 2010s, in the capacity of Unspeakable.


== Biography ==
At some point in his career, he entered the Love Chamber in the Department of Mysteries; the log documenting the time of his entry and exit was brought to light during the investigation over the Calamity, as it also showed Grim Fawley was frequently in the room at odd times.
At some point during at least the 2010s, Sallow took members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force on an informal tour of the Department of Mysteries. While on the tour, he taught the task force members about many of the mysterious artefacts kept within the department.
