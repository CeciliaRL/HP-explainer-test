This individual was a witch or wizard who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the late 1970s or early-mid-1980s and was Sorted into Gryffindor. By the 1985â€“1986 school year, he or she had been made Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and was known for misplacing the Broom Wax.


== Behind the scenes ==
This information would only be available if the player of Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery made Jacob's sibling a Gryffindor.
It is possible that this individual is the unidentified Keeper of the player's Quidditch team seen in Quidditch quests, as Quidditch Season 1 is unlocked in Year 2 and this individual is only mentioned if Jacob's sibling is in Gryffindor.
