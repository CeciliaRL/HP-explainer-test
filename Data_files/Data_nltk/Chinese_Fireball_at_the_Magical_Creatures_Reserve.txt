This female Chinese Fireball lived in the Magical Creatures Reserve in the 1980s.


== Biography ==
The Fireball was born without the ability to breathe fire. During the 1985â€“1986 school year, her original owner sent her to the Magical Creatures Reserve hoping that Rubeus Hagrid could help her solve this problem, and should he fail, they would sell her to Corrine Cribb who wanted to make a dragon-skin coat out of her. Jacob's sibling discussed with Penny Haywood and decided that she was sick, so they helped her by bonding with her, brewing an altered version of the Pepperup Potion and using it on her to relight her fire, which worked.


== Behind the scenes ==
If the player suggests exposing her to other dragons, Hagrid will try to get her the socialise with a Welsh Green before the next meeting, but it has minor setback because she seems more close to humans.
The dragon's name, just like all creatures in the Magical Creatures Reserve, can be customised by the player. The dialogue of the quest will subsequently change according to the name determined by the player.
