This wizard was a British Ministry of Magic Obliviator in the 1990s.


== Biography ==
During the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, he was stationed at Mr Roberts' campsite. He apparated in front of Roberts's front-door and used the Memory Charm to erase his memories of the wizarding world. Mr Roberts' had started to question incessantly about the things he was experiencing such as a man that tried to pay him with big gold coins or a "weirdo" wearing a dress. He was one of several Obliviators sent to obliviate Roberts ten times a day. 
The Obliviator was left exhausted, with his chin blue with stubble and deep purple shadows under his eyes. He told Arthur Weasley that the Charm had to be used ten times a day to keep Roberts from realising the true nature of the "foreigners" in his campsite. He then proceeded to help the Weasleys, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger to their tent.
