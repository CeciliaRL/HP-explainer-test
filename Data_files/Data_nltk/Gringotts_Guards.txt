A guard in 1998 		 	 
Gringotts Guards are wizards who are assigned to guard the entrance of Gringotts, the bank of the wizarding world.


== History ==
During the Death Eaters' reign over the wizarding world, security was tightened, and guards used Probity Probe to search anyone attempting to enter the bank.
On 1 May, 1998 Marius and another guard were confunded by Harry Potter, who broke into Gringotts with Hermione Granger (disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange) and Ron Weasley (disguised as Dragomir Despard), and the former-employee Griphook, in order to steal one of Voldemort's Horcruxes from the Lestrange Vault.
