This boy was a wizard and summer intern at the Ministry of Magic sometime before early 1995 and worked in the Department of Mysteries. He went missing within the Department and was never found.


== Behind the scenes ==
This is possible that he fell into veil in Death Chamber and thus died, which could explain his strange disappearance.
It is unclear why the Ministry of Magic would allow summer interns to work in a highly classified department. Perhaps this statement might not be true at all and was only spoken by Bartemius Crouch Junior to try and insult his father.
