A band wearing golden jackets played music at the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour at the Burrow on 1 August, 1997.


== History ==
Before the ceremony began, they smoked pipes under a tree near the tent with the waiters. Once the reception started, the band moved to the podium, and played music for the guests to dance to. After everyone at the wedding was informed of the Fall of the British Ministry of Magic by the Lynx Patronus of Kingsley Shacklebolt, they presumably fled the Wedding following the arrival of Death Eaters.
