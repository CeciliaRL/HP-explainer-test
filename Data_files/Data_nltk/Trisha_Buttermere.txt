Trisha Buttermere was a Hufflepuff student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. She was extremely fond of Butterbeer and kept a large supply of it at Hogwarts, which allowed her to trade bottles of the beverage for chess pieces, Chocolate Frog Cards, and Gobstones during the 1996–1997 school year.
