Eurig Cadwallader was a Welsh wizard who played as Seeker for the Welsh National Quidditch team in the 2014 Quidditch World Cup.


== Biography ==
Despite catching the Snitch a very short time into the game, few of her teammates or supporters showed much interest even though Wales had advanced into the quarter-finals due to the fact that Thorsten Pfeffer had performed a botched Wronski Feint just eleven minutes previously.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is possible that the Cadwallader mentioned in Half-Blood Prince as playing Chaser for the Hufflepuff team is this very same Eurig Cadwallader, given their similarities in age and surname, and the fact that Hogwarts students come only from Britain, with Wales being in Britain.
