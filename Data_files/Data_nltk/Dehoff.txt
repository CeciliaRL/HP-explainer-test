Dehoff was a wizard or witch who invented bimetal alchemical thread. This magical fibre, which Dehoff patented, was invisible to Dark Wizards, and as such was used to make the protective product Hex-a-Gone. However, Hex-a-Gone had "extremely complicated and laborious instructions" that had to be carefully followed, and could result in unintended home "hexidents" if used improperly. Dehoff would not be held legally responsible for such "hexidents."
