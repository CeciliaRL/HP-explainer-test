This individual was a wizard who, in his lifetime, was Head of Gryffindor House.


== Biography ==
A portrait of this wizard hung in Gryffindor Tower. In 1994, when Harry Potter opened his golden egg he was terrified and was seen holding his hands over his ears. In 1995, he lamented the lack of a background in his picture, noting that the portrait of the Quidditch Player on the opposite wall had an entire Quidditch pitch.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, he was credited as GCR Portrait Male 4, and was voiced by Jonathan Kydd. His portrait also appears in the Gryffindor Common Room in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, but does not speak.
