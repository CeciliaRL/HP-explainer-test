Morholt was a Giant from Ireland. He was the brother of the King of Ireland. He wounded the Celtic hero, Tristan with a poisoned sword after Tristan tried to kill him.


== Behind the scenes ==
Morholt was based on the figure in Celtic legend of the same name.
Although Morholt's brother was the King of Ireland, Morholt would not have been a prince nor royalty as the High King was elected, as opposed to inheriting the position from a family member.
