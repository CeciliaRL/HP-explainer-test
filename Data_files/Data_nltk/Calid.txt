Calid was a Persian alchemist and the son of Jasichus. His advice on the correct measurement of "fire" was referenced in a block of text featured on the back cover of the book The Decline of Pagan Magic.


== Behind the scenes ==
This character is referenced in a block of text on the back cover of a prop book featured in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. The text in question was taken from an 1889 English translation of the French book Le livre des figures hiéroglyphiques (The Book of Hieroglyphic Figures), which was first published in 1612, and has been attributed to Nicolas Flamel (c. 1330 – 1418).
Calid is a legendary figure to whom alchemical writings have been attributed. He has been associated with an actual historical figure, Khalid ibn Yazid (died 708 A.D.), an Umayyad prince who took an interest in alchemy and helped to translate the existing body of alchemical literature into Arabic.
As Calid was an alchemist, it is highly likely he was a wizard, but this has not been confirmed in canon.
