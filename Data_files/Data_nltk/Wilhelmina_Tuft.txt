Minister Wilhelmina Tuft was Minister for Magic from 1948 to 1959, being elected at least twice. Tuft was a cheery witch who presided over a period of welcome peace and prosperity. She died in office after discovering, too late, her allergy to Alihotsy-flavoured fudge, and was succeeded by her son Ignatius Tuft.
