== Etymology ==
In Norse religion, "Asgard" (Old Norse: Ásgarðr; meaning "Enclosure of the Æsir"[1]) is one of the Nine Worlds and is the country or capital city of the Norse Gods surrounded by an incomplete wall attributed to a Hrimthurs riding the stallion Svadilfari, according to Gylfaginning. Valhalla is located within Asgard. Odin and his wife, Frigg are the rulers of Asgard.
