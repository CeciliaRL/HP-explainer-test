Dennis was a toad and the pet of Tulip Karasu.


== Biography ==
During the 1986â€“1987 school year, Dennis was present when Jacob's sibling arrived to the Transfiguration Classroom with a friend, trying to talk to Tulip Karasu for the first time. Tulip claimed to be busy, and told the newcomers to instead talk to Dennis, who had a Dungbomb strapped on its back. This prompted them to work on defusing the Dungbomb on Dennis before Tulip was ready to talk.
After an announcement of a Frog Choir audition made by Professor Flitwick, Tulip Karasu met with Jacob's sibling and expressed Dennis' interest in joining the Frog Choir. Due to Tulip herself being a terrible singer, she wanted Jacob's sibling to take Dennis with him to the Frog Choir audition. Jacob's sibling agreed to do so, and bonded with Dennis over several events, one of which was playing tricks on Madam Pince. Jacob's sibling then took Dennis to practise with the Weird Sisters and sing in front of Professor Snape to test their nerves.
