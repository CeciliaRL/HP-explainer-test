Gringott (fl. 1474) was a celebrated goblin who founded Gringotts Wizarding Bank in 1474. For the Bank's founding and presumable management, Gringott was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card.

Gringott's Chocolate Frog Card does not give out his dates. However, since it is known that Gringotts Bank was established in 1474, we can assume that he lived sometime in the 15th century.
There is a gold statue of Gringott standing on a pile of coins at Diagon Alley.
