Elizabeth I (7 September 1533 - 24 March 1603) was a Muggle who reigned as Queen of England and Ireland from 1558 until her death.


== Biography ==
She was the daughter of King Henry VIII by his second wife, Anne Boleyn, and the half-sister of Mary I.
Queen Elizabeth never married during her lifetime. However, there was "ample" evidence suggesting that the first Lucius Malfoy sought her hand in marriage, but was rebuffed by her. Some wizarding historians believed that her later opposition to marriage was the result of a jinx that Malfoy placed on her in revenge for her spurning him. This account was denied by future generations of the Malfoy family.
During her rule, she was seen as the one the greatest ever rulers of England, with her reign being called the "Golden Age".


== Etymology ==
The name "Elizabeth" comes from Ελισαβετ (Elisabet), the Greek form of the Hebrew name אֱלִישֶׁבַע ('Elisheva') meaning "my God is an oath" or perhaps "my God is abundance".
