== Biography ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			A Muggle newspaper reporting the arrest of her family 		 	 
Her husband was involved in illicit activities, and he involved their elder son in it. They were eventually caught by Muggle police, and she tried to use her magic to help the two escape. She frightened the police and violated the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in doing so.
Her efforts did not help, and her husband and their son were taken to a Muggle prison. Because she violated wizarding law, she was put in the custody of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. At her trial in a wizarding court of law, she was accused and found guilty of being a member of the Nocturnal Order of Tricks and Magical Exhibitions, and was sentenced to Azkaban.
It is unknown if she was involved in the organisation, because anyone who used magic openly was suspected of being so. The incident was put in a Muggle newspaper under the heading, "The Bloody Pages". Her youngest son, Daniel was put under the guardianship of their daughter.
