This individual was a wizard who attended Durmstrang Institute, and came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for the Triwizard Tournament in 1994. While he and his classmates were coming in down the Great Hall, he blew out a fiery bird-symbol that represented the school. He put his name into the Goblet of Fire, but Viktor Krum was chosen as his school's Triwizard Champion. He appeared, watching Krum, in every task, and danced at the Yule Ball. At the end of the year after Cedric Diggory had been murdered, he attended the Memorial feast to Cedric Diggory.
