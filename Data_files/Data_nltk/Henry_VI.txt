Henry VI of England (6 December 1421 â€“ 21 May 1471) was King of England from 1422 to 1461 and again from 1470 to 1471.
He had a large, white rabbit as an advisor, which may have contributed to the widespread perception that he was mad. However, it is possible that this rabbit was actually Lisette de Lapin, a French witch who escaped from prison in Animagus form after being convicted of witchcraft by Muggles.


== Etymology ==
The name "Henry" comes from the Germanic name Heimirich which meant "home ruler", composed of the elements heim "home" and ric "power, ruler". It was later commonly spelled Heinrich, with the spelling altered due to the influence of other Germanic names like Haganrich, in which the first element is hagan "enclosure".
