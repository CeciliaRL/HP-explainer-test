Caspar Crouch (fl. 20th century) was a pure-blood wizard who married pure-blood Charis Black from the noble House of Black. The couple had three children: a son and two daughters. He might be the father of Bartemius Crouch Snr, though this is unconfirmed.
His name appears on the Black family tree tapestry.
