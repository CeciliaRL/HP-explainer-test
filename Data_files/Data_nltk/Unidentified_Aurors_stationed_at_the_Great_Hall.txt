These four Aurors were tasked by then Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, with providing extra security at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1996â€“1997 school year in light of the Return of Lord Voldemort. They were present in the Great Hall during the Start-of-Term Feast, with three of them stationed outside the doors, and a fourth one standing guard inside.


== Behind the scenes ==
While only seen from a distance, the fourth Auror can briefly be seen pacing in the background by the doors during the welcoming speech, and again when a part of their brown coat are visible in the left corner of the open door behind the three male Aurors at the door. Though not possible to make out any details of how this fourth Auror looks like, said person have noticeably longer hair than the ones outside, seemingly being the same length as Tonks has in the movie. Seen as it might seem to be three men and one woman present, this may indeed be Tonks, Dawlish, Proudfoot and Savage, all of whom was referenced in the sixth book as having been stationed in Hogsmeade for the same reason.
One of them was presumably the Unidentified male Auror at Hogwarts.
