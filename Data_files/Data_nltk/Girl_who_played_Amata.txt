This girl attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early part of the 20th century. She was cast as Amata in the Christmas production of "The Fountain of Fair Fortune" that Professor Herbert Beery arranged. An hour before the play started her boyfriend, who played Sir Luckless in the production, dumped her in favour of the girl playing Asha, causing the two jealous young witches to duel each other on the stage. Professor Beery was caught in the crossfire and unable to stop them or prevent the engorged ashwinder, serving as the gigantic white worm, from setting fire to the Great Hall.
