Vasco Santini was a Spanish wizard who played as a Beater on the Spanish National Quidditch team. He represented his country in at least two Quidditch World Cups.
By 1996, he was included on a Chocolate Frog Card for his achievements in Quidditch.


== Etymology ==
The name "Vasco" comes from the medieval Spanish name Velasco which possibly meant "crow" in Basque. A famous bearer was the 15th-century Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, the first person to sail from Europe around Africa to India. Vasco is also the Spanish word for Basque, referring to the people of the Basque country, an autonomous community in Spain.
