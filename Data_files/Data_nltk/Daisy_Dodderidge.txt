Daisy Dodderidge (1467–1555) was the witch who built the Leaky Cauldron in a successful attempt to create a gateway between the Muggle and wizarding worlds. She was the original landlady of the pub, and the Leaky Cauldron soon became the primary entrance into Diagon Alley.
She was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card after her death in 1555.


== Etymology ==
The name "Daisy" is simply from the English word for the white flower, ultimately derived from Old English dægeseage meaning "day eye". It was first used as a given name in the 19th century, at the same time many other plant and flower names were coined.


== Behind the scenes ==
Daisy Dodderidge's Wizard of the Month entry and Chocolate Frog Card from the video games gives her dates as 1467-1555, but the Wizard of the Coast Chocolate Frog Cards lists them as 1457-1555.
