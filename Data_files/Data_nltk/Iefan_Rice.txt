Iefan Rice was a Welsh wizard and a Beater for the Welsh National Quidditch team in the 2014 Quidditch World Cup. He shot such a ferocious Bludger at Brazilian Keeper Raul Almeida that Almeida very nearly lost his head. Despite this, Rice was permitted to stay on and play, and had to drag manager Gwenog Jones off the pitch after she attacked Brazilian manager Jos√© Barboza.
