Hereward was a wizard who mastered the Elder Wand after killing his own father to acquire it. He succeeded in doing this by locking him in his own cellar to die, after stealing his wand.
It's unknown what Hereward did after obtaining the wand. He ultimately lost possession of the Elder Wand at some point, presumably by being defeated in a duel, killed, or disarmed.


== Etymology ==
The name "Hereward" is derived from the Old English elements here "army" and weard "guard", from which the magial kind of "ward" (as a protection) is also derived. This was the name of an 11th-century Anglo-Saxon leader who rebelled against Norman rule.
