Ingolfr the Iambic was a Norwegian wizard and poet in the early 1400s. He wrote a verse about the game of Quidditch that showed how the game had spread to Europe.


== Etymology ==
The name Ingólfr, was derived from the name of the Germanic god Ing combined with úlfr meaning "wolf".
Iambic is likely a reference to iambic pentameter, a common poetry metre best known for its extensive use by William Shakespeare. Oddly, his only known poem is not in an iambic metre, but instead anapestic tetrameter.
