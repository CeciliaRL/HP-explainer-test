Sue Li was a half-blood witch who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991. She was in the same year as Harry Potter and was sorted into Ravenclaw house.


== Etymology ==
Lǐ, written 李, is one of the most common surnames in China. It was the surname of the Tang Dynasty rulers.
"Sue" comes from the Chinese 素 "plain", or possibly 肃 or 肅 which both mean "respectful".
Sue could have been an English name her parents picked for her, instead; it means "graceful lily" in Hebrew.
