Rancorous Carpe was the caretaker of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1876. Carpe was the protagonist of the last and most disastrous attempt to have Peeves, the resident poltergeist, removed from the Castle.


== Biography ==
In 1876, Carpe designed an elaborate trap in an attempt to capture and remove Peeves the poltergeist from Hogwarts; the trap included an assortment of weapons which the caretaker believed would be irresistible to Peeves, as well as a vast enchanted bell jar reinforced by various Containment Charms. He believed it would work, but instead Peeves burst through the bell jar, scattering the corridor with broken glass and firing random weapons acquired from the trap. The castle had to be evacuated, and it wasn't until the Headmistress, Professor Eupraxia Mole, agreed to sign a contract allowing Peeves to swim in the boys' toilet once each week, to have first choice of stale bread from the kitchens for throwing purposes, and giving him a new custom-made hat by Madame Bonhabille of Paris, that the poltergeist agreed to stand down.
Following this incident, Rancorous Carpe took early retirement, citing "health reasons".
