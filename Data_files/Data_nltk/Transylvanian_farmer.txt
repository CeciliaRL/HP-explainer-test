A Transylvanian farmer was supposedly cured of a Babbling Curse by Gilderoy Lockhart. However, it is far more likely that Lockhart either fabricated the incident up or simply took credit for it. In Harry Potter's second year in 1992, Professor Lockhart chose Harry to help act out this incident during one of his Defence Against the Dark Arts classes.
