Fulbert the Fearful (1014 -1097) was a wizard who was famous for being so cowardly that he never ventured out of his house. In a twist of irony, he died when a Defensive Charm backfired and his roof caved in. For this reason, he was immortalised on a Chocolate Frog Card.


== Etymology ==
The name "Fulbert" is from the Germanic elements folk "people" and beraht "bright". Saint Fulbert was an 11th-century bishop of Chartres.


== Behind the scenes ==

It appears that Fulbert the Fearful embodies J.K. Rowling's personal belief that living an excessively cautious life is hardly a life at all, and doing so will just makes you lose. She expressed this during her Commencement Speech at Harvard University in 2008.
