On 1 September, 1992, a Muggle man in the parking lot of King's Cross Station, was waiting for his train, and commented that he was going to have an enjoyable train ride whilst playing his Game Boy during the journey. He also ate some chips before his trip which gave him indigestion and made him burp.
