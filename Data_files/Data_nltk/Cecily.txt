Cecily was an American witch in the 1920s.


== Biography ==
In 1926, Cecily was in a relationship with MACUSA employee Sam, who worked as an Obliviator. Unbeknownst to her, however, Sam was also romantically involved with his co-worker Ruby. Queenie Goldstein, a Legilimens, uncovered Sam's infidelity by reading his mind, and bargained with him that she would not reveal his secret if he did not wipe the memory of the No-Maj Jacob Kowalski.
