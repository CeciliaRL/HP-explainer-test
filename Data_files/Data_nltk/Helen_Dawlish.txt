Helen Dawlish was a witch, member of the Dawlish family who was a Ravenclaw student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. She was also a member of the Duelling Club.


== Biography ==
In 1993, she could be found in the Fat Lady's Corridor. She was a fan of Gilderoy Lockhart, and spent the summer of 1996 reading his books, of which Magical Me was her favourite. After returning to school for the 1996–1997 school year, she ran a Duelling Club in the Transfiguration Courtyard, which also included Shoma Ichikawa and Rhonda Fladbury. She offered sloth brains as a reward to everyone who beat her in a duel.


== Etymology ==
The name "Helen" is the English form of the Greek ‘Ελενη (Helene), probably from Greek ‘ελενη (helene) "torch" or "corposant", or possibly related to σεληνη (selene) "moon". In Greek mythology Helen was the daughter of Zeus and Leda, whose kidnapping by Paris was the cause of the Trojan War.


== Behind the scenes ==
This particular student was only featured in the console versions of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Nintendo DS version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
If Helen is indeed related to John Dawlish, her mandatory attendance at Hogwarts, where she was at the mercy of the Carrows, presumably played a part in his cooperation with the Death Eater-controlled Ministry.
