Minister Eldritch Diggory (d. 1747) was Minister for Magic from 1733 to 1747. He defeated Perseus Parkinson for reelection in 1733 and was reelected at least once.


== Biography ==
Minister Diggory was born into the Diggory family, a wizarding family of unknown blood status. At an unknown point (though probably at age eleven like most children) he bought a wand at Ollivanders. According to Garrick Ollivander, he owned a "fine" poplar wand.
Diggory was later appointed as the British Minister for Magic. He was a popular Minister and first established an Auror recruitment programme in Great Britain.
At some point in his career, Diggory visited Azkaban. This proved to be a shock for him, since he'd had no idea of the awful conditions inside the prison. Many within the prison died of despair and the rest were mostly insane. When he returned to London, Diggory established a committee to explore alternatives to Azkaban, or at least remove the Dementors as guards. Experts argued that if the Dementors were deprived of prisoners' souls on which they could feed, they might abandon the prison and head for the mainland. However, Diggory, being so horrified at what he had seen, continued his search for alternatives nonetheless.
In 1747, Diggory died in office due to a case of Dragon Pox. This disabled the committee from reaching a decision concerning Azkaban.


== Etymology ==
Eldritch is an English word of uncertain origin meaning "alien, supernatural". The term is most closely related with the works of American horror author H. P. Lovecraft, which launched a type of monsters known as "eldritch abominations", of which Dementors are sometimes seen as a low-key example.
