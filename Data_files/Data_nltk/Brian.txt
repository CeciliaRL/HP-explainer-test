Brian was a boy who lived at Godric's Hollow. On the night of 31 October 1981, he dressed up as a vampire for a Hallowe'en party in his house: mistaking a hooded Lord Voldemort for a friend who was late for the party, he approached him, only to be stricken with fear as he peered into the man's hood and quickly stumbled back into his yard.
