The owner of the Railview Hotel in Cokeworth was a Muggle woman. On 30 July, 1991, she found about one hundred Hogwarts acceptance letters for Harry Potter at the front desk, as the boy was staying in room 17 with the Dursleys. Vernon Dursley took these letters from her and checked out of the hotel.
