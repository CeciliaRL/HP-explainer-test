Kennilworthy Whisp was an English wizard, author and Quidditch expert/fanatic, known for having written a number of Quidditch-related works, including the best-selling book Quidditch Through the Ages. Whisp resided in Nottinghamshire in England, and divided his time between his home and "wherever the Wigtown Wanderers were playing". His hobbies included playing backgammon, vegetarian cookery, and collecting vintage broomsticks. Despite liking vegetarian cookery, he was not a vegetarian.

== Behind the scenes ==
J. K. Rowling does not think Kennilworthy Whisp and Newton Scamander would be friends.
Emily Gravett, the illustrator of Quidditch Through the Ages: Illustrated Edition, used her father as the image for Kennilworthy Whisp in said edition.
