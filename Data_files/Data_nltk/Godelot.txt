Godelot was a medieval dark wizard who once owned the Elder Wand. Described as an "unpleasant character", Godelot considered the Elder Wand to be an instructor, and used his knowledge of the wand's powers to write Magick Moste Evile, a book that contained information on dark magic. Despite his affinity towards dark magic, he refused to discuss Horcruxes, deeming them and the ritual involved too dark even for him. Godelot perished in his own cellar, after he was locked in by his son, Hereward, who did this to gain ownership of the Elder Wand.
