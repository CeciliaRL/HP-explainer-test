Count Vlad Drakul (b. 1390) was a notorious vampire who inspired the author Bram Stoker to create his famous character Count Dracula. Drakul had a son, Vlad the Impaler, who presumably shared his father's notorious reputation.


== Behind the scenes ==
Vlad II Dracul, (Vlad the Dragon) was a "voivode" (duke or prince) of Wallachia (a region that corresponds with modern-day Southern Romania), and reigned from 1436 to 1442, and again from 1443 to 1447.
In reality, there are various theories as to Stoker's inspiration for Dracula. He was inspired by a Wallachian duke named Dracula (i.e. Dracul's son or Dragon's son), so it is Dracul's son Vlad the Impaler who is more commonly considered the source of inspiration.
