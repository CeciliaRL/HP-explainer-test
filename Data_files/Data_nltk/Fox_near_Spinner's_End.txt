This fox lived by the river near Spinner's End, the erstwhile home of Severus Snape.


== Biography ==
The fox was apparently underfed, as it was described as scrawny, and was scavenging amongst rubbish for food. The fox was present when Narcissa Malfoy and her sister Bellatrix Lestrange Apparated to Spinner's End to meet with Severus Snape. The fox attempted to flee the area, but was killed by Bellatrix via a nonverbal Killing Curse when it ran, as she thought it may have been an Auror, in her fear of getting caught.
