This individual was a wizard who, in 1379, partook in an international duelling contest on Dartmoor.


== Biography ==
The duelling was noted, by witnesses, to have been of a standard that few had ever seen before. As the contest progressed, only four contestants remained: this wizard, three more wizards, and an English witch, Elizabeth Smudgling.

This wizard was the second semi-finalist, and was to take part in the first duel. Keeping in mind the judges' advice to "think big", the first semi-finalist transformed himself into a bull and charged him, who escaped death by quickly turning himself into a viper. He then bit the first wizard on the leg, sending him crashing to the ground in pain.

Next, he faced the third semi-finalist, and brought a great storm cloud down from the sky, drenching his opponent in freezing-cold rain and forcing him to evade bolts of lightning. The third wizard then got the idea to call a powerful cyclone, which not only blew away the storm, but also this individual, the judges, most of the spectators and several trees.
Considering that in the Middle Ages, before there was a Ministry of Magic to regulate such matters, duelling was usually fatal, and given his particularly violent defeat, it is likely this individual died.
