Nigelle le Narcissique was a circus performer in the 1920s. 


== Biography ==
She was part of the Circus Arcanus, a travelling freak show, which billed her as a "bona fide" member of the species Homo amphibia, a humanoid reptilian who "freakishly devour[ed]" her own tail while singing popular Gaelic folk songs.


== Behind the scenes ==
While being named "Nigelle", a seemingly female name, the french article used to describe it, "le", is masculine. If Nigelle was a female, its name should be Nigelle "la" Narcissique.
"Narcissique" is the french for Narcissistic.
