Eleanor Sarah Gibbs was a witch who was reported missing on the Potterwatch wireless programme in 1997. Her disappearance was most likely linked to a Death Eater attack.


== Etymology ==
The name "Eleanor" is from the Old French form of the Provençal name Aliénor. It was first borne by the influential Eleanor of Aquitaine (12th century), who was the queen of Louis VII, the king of France, and later Henry II, the king of England. She was named Aenor after her mother, and was called by the Provençal phrase alia Aenor "the other Aenor" in order to distinguish her from her mother.


== Behind the scenes ==
This character is presumably a tribute to a relative of Dominic Gibbs. Gibbs worked as a sound effects editor on Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, and as a sound designer on Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
