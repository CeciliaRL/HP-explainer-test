Minister Harold Minchum was Minister for Magic between 1975 and 1980.
He was seen as a hard-liner, and placed even more Dementors around Azkaban. But he was unable to contain what seemed like Voldemort's unstoppable rise to power.


== Behind the scenes ==
The name "Harold Minchum" is a near-homophone of Harold Wilson, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom whose second term in office (1974 to 1976) would have coincided with that of Harold Minchum's.
