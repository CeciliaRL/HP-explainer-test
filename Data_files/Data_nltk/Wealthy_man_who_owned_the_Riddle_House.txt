This individual (fl. 1994) was a wealthy Muggle man, who owned the Riddle House in the 1990s.
He did not live in it, nor put it to any use, although he still paid Frank Bryce to do the gardening before his death in 1994. Nobody in Little Hangleton seemed to know why he kept the house, although it was said it was for "tax reasons".
