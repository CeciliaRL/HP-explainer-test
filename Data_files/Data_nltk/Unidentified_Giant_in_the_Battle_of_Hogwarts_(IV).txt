This giant was a member of the Giant colony who fought in the Battle of Hogwarts, fighting for Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. It is unknown if he survived the battle, but he possibly died.


== Behind the scenes ==
This giant is played by Matthew Bancroft in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, but he was not credited along with the other giants so only three of them are credited.
Bancroft's giant, unlike I, II and III, did not appear in the video game.
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7 this giant stands on the top of an area in a courtyard. He has to be shot with a catapult three times before he falls backwards into the Ravine below.
