== Biography ==

 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Mrs Goldstein, dancing with her daughter and husband 		 	 
Sometime in her daughters' childhood, the Goldstein family danced together while dressed up.
She and her husband died from Dragon Pox when their daughters were young. This left the girls to "raise each other," which lead them to forge a life-long bond.
After being sentenced to death in 1926, Tina Goldstein had her happy memories extracted from her head by Bernadette, who then cast them into the execution potion in the Death Cell. To keep Tina sedated, the potion replayed the memories for her, including one of her mother calling her "pumpkin" and asking if she was ready for bed.


== Behind the scenes ==
Mrs Goldstein was played by Fanny Carbonnel in flashback scenes in the film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. At 27-years-old when the film was made, she was actually younger than actresses Katherine Waterston and Alison Sudol, who played her daughters as adults.
