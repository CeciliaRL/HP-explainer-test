This wizard portraitist (fl. Middle Ages) was responsible for creating the portrait of Sir Cadogan that would eventually be hung in Hogwarts Castle. The portrait was composed of both Cadogan and his pony on a vibrant landscape. As the portraitist interpreted Cadogan as a fairly unbalanced wizard, constantly looking for a fight and falling from his horse, this was how the portrait acted upon its completion.
