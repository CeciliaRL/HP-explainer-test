Chroniculus Punnet was a magical historian and author.


== Etymology ==
Chroniculus is a derivation of the English word Chronicle, meaning "a written account of events and when they happened, ordered by time". *Punnet is a pun on the English word Pun, meaning "joke or type of wordplay".


== Behind the scenes ==
In the console version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (video game), Punnet is credited as the wizard who wrote Hogwarts, A History. However, a later film prop identifies the book's author as Professor Garius Tomkink, and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter ultimately presents Bathilda Bagshot as the author.
