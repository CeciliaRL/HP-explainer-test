Prendergast was a wizard who worked at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in around the 1910s in an unknown capacity.


== Biograhy ==
He once gave Newton Scamander a month's worth of detention for arguing that there are no such thing as strange creatures, just blinkered people. Leta Lestrange later set off a dungbomb under Prendergast's desk so she could join Newt in detention.
