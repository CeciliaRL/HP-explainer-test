== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
The woman was born sometime in or before 1980, and was at least somewhat learned in the magical arts. Sometime from 1997-1998 she became a Snatcher for the Voldemort-controlled Ministry of Magic, capturing Muggle-borns for a reward.


=== Battle and death ===
On 2 May, 1998, the woman participated in the Battle of Hogwarts with her fellow Snatchers, presumably casting an unidentified blue spell at the shield along with the others. She died at the Skirmish at the Covered Bridge, and hence was technically killed by Neville Longbottom.
