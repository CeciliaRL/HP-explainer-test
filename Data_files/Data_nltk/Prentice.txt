Mr Prentice was a Muggle who lived in Little Whinging in the 1990s.
In the evening of 2 August, 1995, after Harry Potter and Dudley Dursley were attacked by Dementors, Arabella Figg told Harry, a wizard to keep his wand out in case of another attack, not minding the presence of Muggle Mr Prentice as they crossed Wisteria Walk.


== Behind the scenes ==
When Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released, many thought Mr Prentice was, perhaps, another member of the Order who, like Mrs Figg was assigned to watch over Harry during the summer, given her lack of preoccupation of him spotting Harry's wand. J. K. Rowling, however, dispelled these rumours on her J. K. Rowling's official site by saying "Mark Evans is... nobody. He's nobody in the sense that Mr Prentice, Madam Marsh and Gordon-Dudley's-gang-member are nobodies, just background people who need names, but who have no role other than the walk-on parts assigned to them". It is, thus, more than likely that the risk of Mr Prentice noticing the wand was outweighed by the risk of encountering Dementors without a wand at the ready by Mrs Figg.
