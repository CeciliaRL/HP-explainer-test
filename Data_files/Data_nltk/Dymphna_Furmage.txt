=== Early life ===
Ms. Furmage was born in 1612, somewhere in the British Isles. If she enrolled at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she attended the school from around 1623 to 1630.


=== Adulthood ===
Sometime in the mid to late seventeenth century, Furmage went on holiday to Cornwall, in southwest England. There, she was the victim of an abduction by Pixies, a species of pesky beast endemic to the region. As a result Ms. Furmage developed a mortal dread of them for the rest of her life.

Later, and most assuredly fuelled by her fear of the Pixies, she strongly campaigned for the British Ministry of Magic to "humanely [destroy]" all of the species. She failed, however, and ended up dying in 1698, still in mortal dread of the mischievous creatures. For her efforts, she was included on a Famous Witch Card, as part of the Chocolate Frog Card series.
