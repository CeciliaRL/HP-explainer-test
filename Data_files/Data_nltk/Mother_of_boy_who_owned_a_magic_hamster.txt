This individual was a witch who lived in the British Isles. She later got married to a wizard and in c. 1980 she had a son. They were presumably very poor as they saved on the light bill by using the Wand-Lighting Charm, Lumos, to save Galleons to be able to afford their son's trip to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
