This Portrait of a witch hung in Malfoy Manor during 1997 and 1998, while the house was being used as Lord Voldemort's headquarters. The portrait witnessed the death of Charity Burbage and other meetings Lord Voldemort held with his Death Eaters.


== Behind the scenes ==
The individual in this portrait may have died prior to 1997, because many portraits depict deceased individuals. In addition, the individual's clothing seems to support this.
This portrait is based off of a c. 1570-75 portrait of Frances Radclyffe, Countess of Sussex (1531â€“1589).
