This young witch (1918 â€“ September 1926) lived in Sudan in the early 20th century.


== Biography ==
This young witch was born in Sudan in 1918.
While still a young child, her magical powers were discovered by Muggles, leading them to imprison her. This treatment lead her to suppress her magic to the point that she became an Obscurial.
In September 1926, when she was eight years old, the British magizoologist Newt Scamander came across her while in Africa studying magical beasts. Newt tried to save the girl, managing to separate the Obscurus from her, though she died regardless. Newt was able to preserve the Obscurus despite the death of its host and afterward kept it in a magical bubble in his magical suitcase.
The girl represented the first documented incidence of an Obscurial in centuries.
The presence of her Obscurus in his suitcase, among other potentially dangerous magical creatures, got Newt into serious trouble with the MACUSA, to the point where it was believed that he and his creatures were the cause of the destructive magical attacks around the city at that time. However, his experience also led Newt to correctly deduce that the attacks were actually caused by another Obscurial.
