Odo was a heroic wizard, about whom a song was written, titled "Odo the Hero".


== History ==

In 1996, Rubeus Hagrid and Professor Slughorn sang the song about Odo when they were drunk right after Aragog's funeral. Also, at Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding Hagrid, Charlie Weasley, and a "squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat" were singing "Odo the Hero".


== Etymology ==
"Odo" is a name typically associated with historical figures from the Middle Ages and before, most especially Count Odo, who led an unsuccessful defence of Paris against the Vikings in 885. Odo, and its later form Otto, are etymologically related to various European names which all come from a Germanic word meaning "possessor of wealth".


== Behind the scenes ==
Odo could have possibly been a friend of Hagrid's since Hagrid was around in both situations the song was sung or it could just be a drinking song of sorts. The latter seems more likely.
