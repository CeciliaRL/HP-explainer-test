Pitts was a house-elf employed at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was previously owned by a wizard or witch, who treated him cruelly and gave him to the Hogwarts kitchens for next to nothing. According to Rita Skeeter, Jacob spoke to him shortly before his expulsion. He was strict when it came to making sure other house-elves and students in detention did their work properly in the kitchens.
He also noted that Barnaby Lee had "an appetite like a Mountain Troll" and Hogwarts kitchens had to increase their sandwich production.
