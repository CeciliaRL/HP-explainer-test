Mrs Hall was an American No-Maj woman accused of murdering her husband, Reverend Hall, and a Mrs Mills on 14 September 1926.
At the trial held later in 1926, a Mrs Gibson testified that, on the night of the murders, she saw Mrs Hall in De Russey Lane with a male companion. Mrs Gibson stated she was able to see their faces because of a passing car. George Sipel was subpoenaed to confirm her claim he was driving this vehicle. Mrs Gibson claimed that she had heard that Sipel had told his friend, John Garry, that he had seen her on the night of the murders. Sipel denied this allegation and reportedly showed a "frantic eagerness" to avoid testifying. The trial was reported on in the 6 December 1926 issue of the New York Chronicle.


== Behind the scenes ==
The text of the article mentioning Mrs Hall in the prop issue of the New York Chronicle featured in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them was taken from the real 21 November 1922 issue of The Evening World. This represents an anachronism, as the film is set in 1926, but the actual events referenced occurred in 1922.
