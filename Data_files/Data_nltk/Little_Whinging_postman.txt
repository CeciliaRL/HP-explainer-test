This individual was a Muggle postman, whose route in Little Whinging included Privet Drive. In the summer of 1994, the postman delivered a letter to the Dursley family, although he chose to ring the doorbell and deliver the letter personally instead of leaving it in the mailbox. The letter in question had been sent by Molly Weasley, who chose to use Muggle post instead of an owl, and was absolutely covered in postage stamps save for a small space where she had written their address. The postman had found this as rather amusing, although Vernon Dursley did not.
