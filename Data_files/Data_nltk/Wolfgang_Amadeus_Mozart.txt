Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (27 January, 1756 â€” 5 December, 1791) was a prolific and influential Austrian composer of the Classical era.
On Sunday, 7 May, in a year prior to 1997, Emanuel Hurwitz and his wife, Kay, a violinist and violist respectively, gave a performance of Mozart's Sinfonia Concertanti at St. Mary's Church Hall. The couple were accompanied by the Dollis Chamber Ensemble. Hermione Granger had a poster for this concert stuck up on the bulletin board in her bedroom in the Granger family's house.
