A veritable legion of house-elves were enlisted by Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. They worked in the kitchens, preparing feasts for the entire school. They also moved trunks and baggage to and from rooms, cleaned dormitories, and presumably other areas of the castle as well. They wore togas made of tea-towels bearing the Hogwarts crest. When asked nicely, they would accommodate the dietary requests of vegetarian students.


== History ==


=== Helga Hufflepuff ===
Helga Hufflepuff brought the house-elves to work in the Hogwarts kitchens as a way of ensuring they could work and not be abused.


=== 1994 ===

In 1994, Dobby, a house-elf, was hired by Albus Dumbledore to work in the kitchens for a Galleon a week. Another house-elf named Winky, took up work at Hogwarts as well, but during her time there she had turned into a heavy drinker. They soon became titled as Hogwarts house-elves although the other House Elves were disconcerted by them.

In the same year, Hermione Granger set up the organisation S.P.E.W., she started coming to the kitchens in order to persuade them to be set free. This did not earn her any popularity, as most believe that house-elves enjoy their work; indeed, even the house-elves did not like her campaigning. She started knitting hats and socks, which she left lying around Gryffindor Tower, hoping to free some unsuspecting elf who picked them up while cleaning the common room, so as to grant them freedom. The house-elves did not appreciate this gesture; on the contrary, they took it for insult and refused to clean the Gryffindor Common Room, with the exception of Dobby. They became angry with Hermione Granger as she made these attempts to free them.


=== 1998 ===

They participated in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998 in an unusually bold move for their kind, although this may have been a manifestation of their extreme loyalty to their "masters". They fought with knives and cleavers, hacking at the shins of Death Eaters.
