Naasz was a witch and celebrity Magizoologist, noted for her relentless ego. She always wanted to be a headmistress and so she opened the unaccredited Naaszcademy of Magizoology in Brussels.


== Biography ==
In the 2010s, Naasz took members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who pursued a Magizoologist profession on a journey to India to find a wild Phoenix in its natural habitat. The experience of it, however, ended up being a test of patience due to the endless interviews they agreed to give, and her egotistical demeanour.
Naasz once tricked a Calamity Investigator into transporting her store of personally-designed (and almost completely useless) magical artefacts to the Ministry of Magic for safekeeping. At one point she created or obtained a trinket described as a "green-dyed Hippogriff feather with tiny baubles hanging equidistantly around the spine." It was sent to a member of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, who thought it looked like a rather cheap souvenir. Naasz insisted that it was a valuable artefact, and carrying it seemed to increase the Task Force volunteer's chances of keeping a Magizoological Trace in their sights.
In America, Naasz performed a one-woman, wordless stage play titled 'The Calamitous Calamity'. It was emotionally stirring. She also hosted a relentless and sophomoric lecture about theoretical magic regarding harmonic attuning and energy.
Naasz once attempted to sell her own blend of tea, but the taste was revolting. She was convinced to sell it as a solvent instead, to the relief of teashop owners.
She once released a long-winded 21-page pamphlet detailing techniques for handling creatures commonly deployed by the Calamity as Confoundables, but only four things within were actually useful. Naasz also opened a school in Brussels on a whim, desiring the position of headmistress. It had no faculty or staff.
