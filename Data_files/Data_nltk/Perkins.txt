Perkins (fl. 1975 - 1998) was a British warlock who worked in the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office at the Ministry of Magic, as a subordinate of Arthur Weasley, who was head of the office.


== Biography ==
During the Quidditch World Cup in 1994, Perkins lent his supervisor, Arthur Weasley, a tent so he and his family could camp out after the match. Perkins allowed the Weasleys to keep the tent after his lumbago got worse and he no longer had any interest in camping. His tent would later be used by Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger during their search for Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes.
Perkins met Harry Potter in 1995 when the boy was summoned before the Wizengamot to answer a charge of using magic in front of a Muggle. In 1997, he attended the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour.
