Jeremy Clarkson is a British broadcaster and journalist best known as the co-presenter of the television programme Top Gear. In 2015, the BBC announced it was cancelling Clarkson's contract after he verbally and physically attacked one of the show's producers, thus leading to an online petition to reinstate him.
Among those who signed the petition was Vernon Dursley, who stated that Top Gear was the only reason he paid his television licence, which all British households are required to pay yearly in order to legally view television broadcasts.
