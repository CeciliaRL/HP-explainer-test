Poderick Crookshank (born c. 1532) was a wizard whose portrait  hung at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
His portrait was inscribed "Ano Dm. 1568", indicating the year in which it was painted, and "Ætatis Suæ 36", indicating his age at the time the portrait was made, as anno etatis suæ is Latin for "in the year of his age".


== Behind the scenes ==
Poderick Crookshank's portrait seems to have been based on a 1568 portrait of Henry Lee of Ditchley by Antonis Mor.
At The Making of Harry Potter, the portrait of Poderick Crookshank was erroneously put in a frame labelled "Sir Google Flange," but Crookshank was correctly identified in The Paintings of Hogwarts: Masterpieces from the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry Sets.
Within the in-universe continuity, this individual may have been Crookshanks's namesake, just like a name from A History of Magic was picked by Harry Potter as his owl's name.
