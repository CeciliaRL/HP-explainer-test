Hardwin Potter was the eldest son of Linfred of Stinchcombe. Upon his father's death, he inherited a sizable sum of gold, as did each of his six siblings. Hardwin met and married Iolanthe Peverell of Godric's Hollow. Iolanthe, the granddaughter of Ignotus Peverell, inherited the Cloak of Invisibility, since there were no male heirs in her generation. She told Hardwin that, by tradition in her family, possession of the cloak was kept secret. He respected her wishes, and, from then on, the cloak was passed down to the eldest child of each new generation of the Potter family. Henry Potter, a member of the Wizengamot from 1913 to 1921 and the great-grandfather of Harry Potter, was a direct descendant of Hardwin and Iolanthe.
