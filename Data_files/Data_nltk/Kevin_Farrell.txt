== Biography ==
Kevin began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at the age of eleven. He spoke to Ivy Warrington in a first-year boat on the way up to the school, and thought she was nice. He told Professor McGonagall at the Sorting ceremony how he saw and spoke to her when they found out she had vanished. Kevin was sorted into Gryffindor.
Kevin later helped a student and fellow Gryffindor, Robyn Thistlethwaite search for Ivy. He thought it was very easy to get lost in the school, and they had to try not to get lost too. He asked a portrait if he had seen Ivy pass through the Grand Staircase, but he hadn't and warned Kevin he would tell Mr Filch he saw the group.
