Gunhilda Kneen (fl. 12th century) was a witch who was married to Goodwin Kneen. She played Kwidditch (Quidditch), and was a Catcher (Chaser). Prior to a match against a nearby team from Ilkley, Gunhilda contracted a touch of Dragon Pox, and was unable to play, forcing the team to use Radulf. After the victory, Goodwin got drunk at the local inn, and Gunhilda was not best pleased - she jinxed him, causing him to lose his fingers temporarily.

Flying: As a "Catcher" (Chaser), she was presumably a skilled enough broomstick flyer and Quidditch player.
Dark Arts: She once jinxed her husband with a finger-removing jinx, showing she had a level of skill with dark charms.

The name "Gunhilda" comes from the Old Norse name Gunnhildr, derived from the elements gunnr, "war" and hildr, "battle".
