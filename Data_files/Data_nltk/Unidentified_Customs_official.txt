This individual was a No-Maj Customs officer who checked Newton Scamander's suitcase when he arrived in New York in 1926. Seeing one of the latches was flicked open, Newt ensured the case was set to its 'Muggle-worthy' setting, which displayed his clothes and goods to the officer rather than the beasts he cared for, so as to keep him from discovering the wizarding world.
