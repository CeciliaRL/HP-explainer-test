Jane Austen (16 December, 1775 â€“ 18 July, 1817) was a Muggle author who wrote Pride and Prejudice, Emma, and Sense and Sensibility.


== Behind the scenes ==
Jane Austin's books were featured on a bookshelf on an older version of Harry Potter book series author J. K. Rowling's official website.
J. K. Rowling has stated that Jane Austen is her "favourite writer of all time." She also briefly contemplated Austen when asked whom she would choose to be if she could pick anyone in history, but reasoned that Austen probably did not live a very happy life.
