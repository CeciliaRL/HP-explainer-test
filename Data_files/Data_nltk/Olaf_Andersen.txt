Olaf Andersen was a Swedish wizard who played as a Chaser on the Nordic National Quidditch team.


== Biography ==
He played during the four-hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup, in 1994.
During the 1996–1997 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Andersen's Chocolate Frog Card could be won by beating Scarlett Lympsham at a Quidditch challenge.
By at least the 2010s, during the Calamity, Andersen claimed that no teammates had become Foundables since donning colourful team bracelets. Upon investigation, volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force discovered that his team was ranked 43rd in the world - right where no one would think of them.


== Etymology ==
"Olaf" is from the Old Norse name Áleifr meaning "ancestor's descendent", derived from the elements anu "ancestor" and leifr "descendent". This was the name of five kings of Norway, including Saint Olaf (Olaf II).
