On 1 September, 1992, this Muggle man was reading a newspaper outside of the entrance to King's Cross Station in London, wanting to know the time, presumably waiting for a train. On spotting Harry Potter's wand, he assumed that he was playing around with an ordinary stick, and warned him to be careful where he pointed it.
