Miss Granger was a Muggle, second daughter of Mr and Mrs Granger and the younger sister of Hermione Granger.


== Behind the scenes ==
J. K. Rowling stated in an interview that she had initially planned for Hermione to have a younger sister, but by the time Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was released, she still had not made an appearance and Rowling felt it was "too late" by that point.
