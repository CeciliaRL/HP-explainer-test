This individual (born c. 1973-1975) was a wizard who, in the early 1990s, was one of the Gryffindor Prefects at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


== Biography ==

He was patrolling the Seventh-floor corridor on the night of 12 September, 1991, the night when Draco Malfoy challenged Harry Potter for a wizards' duel on the Trophy Room at midnight. As Harry was making his way there, he found this Prefect pacing back and forth and blocking the shortest route to the stairs.


== Behind the scenes ==
This NPC has the distinction of making its only appearance during the Midnight Duel level. Unlike the other Prefects in night sneak missions, who are recurring and sometimes copies of sprites depicting first-year students during the day, this character makes a single appearance during the entire game.


== Appearances ==
Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (video game) (First appearance) (GBA version)
