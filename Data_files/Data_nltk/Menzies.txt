Sir Menzies was a British politician and the leader of the Liberal Party in the 1990s. In July of 1996, Sir Menzies resigned from his leadership post out of frustration and irritation at the media's obsession with trivia and his age, feeling that he could not escape the "cloying blanket of speculation" over his position. After he resigned, Chris Huhne, the party's environment spokesman, (whose supporters briefed against Sir Menzies) announced his candidacy to the leadership of the party, as did Nick Clegg, home affairs spokesman. These events were covered by The Guardian.


== Behind the scenes ==
The listing of Sir Menzies Campbell as the resigning Leader of the Liberal Party in 1996 is anachronistic, as Sir Menzies was only appointed to the office in 2006 and eventually resigned in 2007. Indeed, he would have been fifty-five in 1996, making speculation about his age seem unlikely at that time.
