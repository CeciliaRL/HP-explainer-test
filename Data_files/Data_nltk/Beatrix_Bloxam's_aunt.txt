The aunt of Beatrix Bloxam had children who were older than her niece. 
When she was young, Beatrix listened at a keyhole and was disturbed to hear this aunt tell her children The Warlock's Hairy Heart, as well as parts of a shocking tale involving Beatrix's uncle Nobby, a hag who lived in the area, and a sack of Bouncing Bulbs.
It is unlikely that Beatrix's aunt was married to her uncle Nobby, as she probably wouldn't have chosen to tell her children a scandalous story about their father, particularly not one of the nature implied.
