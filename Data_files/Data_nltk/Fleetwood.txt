Fleetwood was presumably the wizard or witch who gave their name to Fleetwood's High-Finish Handle Polish. It is unknown whether this person was the product's inventor or simply its manufacturer.


== Etymology ==
The surname Fleetwood comes from the name of a town in Lancashire, England, which derives from the Old English flete-wudu, meaning "forest by the river". However, the name was probably intended as a pun, combining the English adjective "fleet", meaning "quick" and "wood" to suggest a fast broom.
