Eduardo was a wizard. According to the Daily Prophet, he was not a pure-blood wizard as he had always pretended; he was not even a pure human. However, as this article was written by Rita Skeeter, this information can be taken with a grain of salt.


== Behind the scenes ==
This individual was only mentioned on a Daily Prophet prop in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The text on the prop appears to be a copy of the "DUMBLEDORE'S GIANT MISTAKE" article featured in the novel (chapter twenty-four), however, in the prop Rubeus Hagrid's name is replaced by "Eduardo", "he" and "him", and Draco Malfoy's is replaced by "Mauricius".
"Eduardo" is most likely a reference to Eduardo Lima, graphic artist for the Harry Potter films since Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
