A very pretty Muggle girl worked as a shopgirl at a paper shop in Ottery St Catchpole.


== Biography ==
During the Christmas holidays of 1996, she was visited by Fred and George Weasley; the latter showed her card tricks that she found extremely impressive, unaware that George was using real magic.
The Weasley twins mentioned her to Harry Potter and their younger brother Ron when they announced that they were leaving the Burrow for the village, and refused to assist Harry and Ron in peeling sprouts. This was partly because Ron had thrown a knife at Fred, who taunted him about his romance with Lavender Brown, suggesting that she must have suffered "extensive brain damage" to be dating him.
