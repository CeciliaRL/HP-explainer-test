Sir Sidley Smirk Platter, Grand Sorc., (born c. 1503) was a wizard who was appointed Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards sometime after Pierre Bonaccord.
Smirk Platter was depicted in a portrait that hung somewhere at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This portrait was painted in 1542, when he was 39 years old, as indicated by the inscription "Anno Etatis Suae 39" (anno aetatis suae is a Latin term meaning "in the year of his age").


== Behind the scenes ==
This portrait was made specifically for the Harry Potter films, and was modelled after Matt Cooke, a member of the dressing props team since Prisoner of Azkaban.
Despite bearing Matt Cooke's likeness, this portrait seems to have been based on a portrait of Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton (c. 1600), by an unknown artist.
Smirk Platter may have passed away sometime prior to the 1990s as many portraits hung at Hogwarts Castle depict deceased individuals.
