The mother of Mary Cattermole was a Muggle greengrocer, as was her husband.
Their daughter was a Muggle-born witch who eventually married Reginald Cattermole and had three children. Her blood status got her into trouble with the Muggle-Born Registration Commission in 1997, when Lord Voldemort was in control of the Ministry of Magic. On her questionnaire, she mentioned her parents' professions, which was inadvisable, as it made it extremely obvious to the unsympathetic regime at the time that she had no magical blood ancestry. Fortunately, Mary was saved by Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley.
