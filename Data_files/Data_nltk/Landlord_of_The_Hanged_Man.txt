=== The Riddle murders ===
The night the Riddles were murdered, in the summer of 1943, his pub was filled with villagers who wanted to gossip about the murders. After the Riddles' cook entered the pub, bringing the news of the arrest of Frank Bryce, the landlord commented that the war turned Bryce funny, perhaps hinting that he believed the gardener was guilty of the murders of his employers.
