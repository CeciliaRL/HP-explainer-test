Chris Lunney was a Muggle photographer who worked for the Daily Express. Two of his photos were featured on the front page of an issue of the paper in the summer of 1995: the first was of heat-exhausted spectators at a Royal Air Force show being tended by a nurse, in an article about an unprecedented heat wave that was then affecting Great Britain titled "Killer Heat," and the second was of a soap star with her hand raised to shield her face from the camera.
