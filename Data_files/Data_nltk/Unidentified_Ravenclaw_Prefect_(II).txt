== Biography ==
In his fifth year, he was made a Prefect and between this year and his seventh year, he duelled Gabriel Truman, a third year at that time, when he claimed that Bridget Wenlock was not a Ravenclaw. Gabriel felt he deserved a week's worth of detentions for his own actions, but Professor Sprout went easy on him, sending him off with a warning and a box of coconut ice.
