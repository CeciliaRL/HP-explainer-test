Mable Dwillingwort may have been a witch who lived in the 12th century. According to one student's answer on their O.W.L. exam for the Theory of Charms (for which they cited the Wizarding Archive of 1152), she was the inventor of the Bat-Bogey Hex which she developed to ward off burglers who were trying to steal her potions. However, Miranda Goshawk claimed to invent this spell herself in the Book of Spells, so it is unclear if the student's answer was incorrect, or if Goshawk was not the original inventor.
