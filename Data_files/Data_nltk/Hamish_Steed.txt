Hamish Steed was a wizard who was murdered on a murderous rampage by Flannery. Even though Steed was under the protection of the Ministry of Magic at the time, the Daily Prophet reported Flannery had used an ancient spell to track him down.
Sage Bragnam thought this story was implausible and that the Daily Prophet's report was a product of exaggeration. However, it seems that Grim Fawley drew inspiration from this report to find his missing wife.
