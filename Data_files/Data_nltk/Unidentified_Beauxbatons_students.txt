The following is a list of Beauxbatons Academy of Magic students whose names are unknown.


== Beauxbatons boy ==
This boy attended Beauxbatons Academy of Magic during the Triwizard Tournament.


=== Biography ===
This wizard was born in either 1977 or 1978. He was one of the students representing Beauxbatons to potentially compete in the 1994 Triwizard Tournament.
After failing to be chosen as champion, the boy remained at Hogwarts to watch his champion, Fleur Delacour. He attended the Yule Ball, during which he noticed Parvati Patil and asked her for a dance. Parvati eagerly accepted, and the two spent the rest of the night together. Parvati and the Beauxbatons boy spent large amounts of time together, meeting in Hogsmeade at least once.
It was unknown what happened to the Beauxbatons boy after the Triwizard Tournament, or if he and Parvati remained in contact.


=== Behind the scenes ===
The Beauxbatons boy was replaced by Igor Karkaroff's aide in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, probably because, in the movie, Beauxbatons is portrayed as an all-girls' school.


=== Appearances ===
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First appearance)


== Beauxbatons girl at the 442nd Quidditch World Cup ==

This girl attended Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in her youth, and was present at the final of the four-hundred and twenty-second Quidditch World Cup along with other colleagues and Beauxbatons Headmistress Olympe Maxime.


=== Biography ===
When a gang of Death Eaters rampaged through Mr Roberts's campsite, this witch, along with her classmates, hid in the nearby forest, where she looked for Madame Maxime, whom they had lost. She then met Ronald Weasley, and she asked him if he had saw her. He did not understand what she told him, since he did not speak French, letting the girl understand he was from Hogwarts.


=== Physical appearance ===
This girl was described to be little, with thick and curly hair.


=== Appearances ===
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (First appearance)


== Crying Beauxbatons girls ==

These two girls attended Beauxbatons Academy of Magic and were part of their school's delegation to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1994 for the Triwizard Tournament. They entered their names in the Goblet of Fire, and when Fleur Delacour was selected as the Beauxbatons Champion, they broke down crying in disappointment.
