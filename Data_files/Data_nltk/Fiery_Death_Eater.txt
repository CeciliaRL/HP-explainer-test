This fiery individual (d. 2 May, 1998) was a Death Eater who participated in the Battle of Hogwarts.


== Biography ==
This Dark Wizard was born sometime in or before 1981, into either a pure or half-blood family, presumably in Great Britain.
He was trained in the magical arts sometime before 1998, most likely at Hogwarts, given that he fought in a battle that year and had became a follower and servant of Lord Voldemort, an immensely powerful Dark Wizard sometime before then. Being a Death Eater, he would have been highly accomplished in the Dark Arts. 
This person, toward the end of the battle, was set ablaze and thrown across the length of the Great Hall to the floor; he very likely died of his injuries.


== Behind the scenes ==
He could, really, be any of the unidentified Death Eaters, given that he was only seen for a few moments and was engulfed in flame for that time.
