This individual was a knight and a wizard in his life, who presumably died when he was shot by an arrow. He returned after his death as a ghost.


== Biography ==
On 31 October, 1992, he attended Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's five-hundredth deathday party at Hogwarts Castle and engaged in conversation with the Fat Friar.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is unknown if this ghost resided at Hogwarts Castle, or if he only came there to celebrate Sir Nicholas's Deathday. If the former is true, he may be intended to be the Black Knight, a ghost ultimately cut from the first book.
It has also been speculated that he is the ghost of Harold II (1022â€”1066), the last Saxon king of England. Harold was defeated at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 by William the Conqueror when an arrow pierced his eye.
