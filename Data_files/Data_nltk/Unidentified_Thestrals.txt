These Thestrals were part of the Hogwarts Thestral Herd; they were used by Dumbledore's Army to ride to the Ministry of Magic on 17 June, 1996 after Harry had a dream about Lord Voldemort torturing Sirius Black.


== Biography ==
The Thestrals were either introduced or born into the Forbidden Forest and the herd of Thestrals already existing therein. As they were adults, it is likely that they had lived in the Forest for some time.
On 17 June, 1996, Harry Potter had a dream about Sirius Black being tortured by Lord Voldemort in the Department of Mysteries; Dolores Umbridge caught him and Hermione Granger in the fire talking to Kreacher at 12 Grimmauld Place, but Hermione led the pair into the Forest, where the centaur colony drew Dolores Umbridge away and, when Grawp the giant assaulted them, they fired arrows at him, peppering the ground and those on it with blood.
Luna Lovegood, Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom and Ron Weasley, who had been captured by Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad, met them in the Forest. The Thestrals, drawn to them by the giant blood soaking Harry and Hermione, offered a method of transport on which they could get to London and thus to the Ministry.
After several hours riding, the Thestrals finally reached their destination, and began scavenging for food in the rubbish bins outside the Ministry. It can be presumed that they returned to Hogwarts.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is possible the Thestrals stayed outside the Ministry until Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Neville and Luna emerged and then carried them back to the school, although it is equally likely that the Order members who had fought in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries Apparated the students back to school.
