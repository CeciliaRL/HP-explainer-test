Bruno Bruunhart was a Liechtenstein wizard and the Seeker for the 2014 Liechtenstein National Quidditch team. On the third day of the fifth match of the 2014 Quidditch World Cup, he managed to catch the Snitch, grabbing it within inches from the outstretched hand of Chadian Seeker Jacques Miskine. This enabled Liechtenstein to win with a score of 470 to 330.
