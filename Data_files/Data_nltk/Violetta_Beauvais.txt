== Biography ==
Beauvais was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. All of the wands she produced were made from swamp mayhaw wood. For many years, she kept the core she used in her wands a closely-guarded secret, but it was eventually discovered to be rougarou hair. Beauvais's wands were often accused of having a natural affinity for Dark magic. However, many great American wizards of the 1920s used Beauvais-made wands, including President Seraphina Picquery.

== Behind the scenes ==
Since Rappaport's Law required  a Wand permit, it is unknown how users of these wands would apply for a permit as the wand Permit application requires the applicant to tell the Wand Permit Office details of the wand. It might be that she was required to inform the Federal Wand Permit Officer.
