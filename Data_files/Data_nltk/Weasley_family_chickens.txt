These chickens were owned by the Weasley family and kept at The Burrow. They lived in their house outside The Burrow. In the year 1997, they were moved away because the Delacour family arrived to the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour.


== History ==

In July 1997, Molly Weasley asked Harry Potter to help Arthur Weasley muck out the chicken coop, but there was very little to do for the chickens because Arthur was using the coop to store the remains of Sirius Black's motorbike. After the arrival of the Delacour family, Harry, Ron and Hermione volunteered to feed the chickens to escape the overcrowded house, but were soon approached by Mrs Weasley, who wanted to discuss arrangements for the wedding.
