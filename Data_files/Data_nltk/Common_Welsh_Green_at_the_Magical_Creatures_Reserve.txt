At some point, Rubeus Hagrid used up nearly all of Professor Sprout's dragon dung to fertilise the pumpkin patch in his garden. Jacob's sibling went caring for this Common Welsh Green with Penny Haywood and collected enough dragon dung for Hagrid.
At the same time, there was a dragon attack on a Muggle village and the Ministry believed it was this Common Welsh Green. Jacob's sibling and Penny used the bag dung to proof what it was doing when the attack occurred to Albus Dumbledore, who was convinced and brought the matter to court, clearing the charges.
