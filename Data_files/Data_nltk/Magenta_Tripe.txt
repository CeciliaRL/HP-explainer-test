Magenta Black (n√©e Tripe) (fl. 19th century) was a pure-blood witch married to the pure-blood wizard, Licorus Black, who was the earliest known member of the House of Black. Her name appears on the Black family tree tapestry that hangs in the ancestral home of 12 Grimmauld Place. It is possible that she was Misapinoa, Cygnus I and Arcturus I's mother.


== Etymology ==
Magenta is a bright pinkish purple colour. (Scientifically, it is a precisely equal mixture of red and blue; it is one of the three subtractive primary colours (CMY/CMYK colour spaces) and one of the three pure additive secondary colours (RGB colour space).) Tripe (from French tripe) is a type of edible offal from the stomachs of various farm animals. It is also used in modern English as a fairly polite synonym for nonsense.


== Behind the scenes ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Another view of Tripe's name on the Black family tree 		 	 
This character appears only on the version of the Black family tree shown in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. She was not included on the version of the tree which J. K. Rowling gave to a charity auction in 2006. However, according to director David Yates, Rowling provided the filmmakers with a copy of the Black family tree going back eight generations. The filmmakers presumably received a more complete version of the tree than the one auctioned off, which only goes back six generations.
