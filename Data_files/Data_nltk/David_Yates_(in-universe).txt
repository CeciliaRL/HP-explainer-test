David Yates was a Muggle British politician who, in the mid-1990s, held the office of Mayor of the City of London.


== Biography ==


=== Millennium Bridge disaster ===

After the collapse of the Millennium Bridge at the hands of Fenrir Greyback and a group of Death Eaters, the Mayor urged Londoners to remain calm, for this was a most unusual event. He also addressed The Guardian, where he described Londoners as having been left "scared, confused and desperate for answers" and pledging to uncover the truth behind the disaster (widely speculated among Muggles to have been caused by a fundamentalist political group).


== Behind the scenes ==
The existence of this individual constitutes an anachronism as the office was created by the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and the first Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, was elected in 2000.
The Mayor's name is an obvious reference to David Yates, the man who directed the last four Harry Potter films, including Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
