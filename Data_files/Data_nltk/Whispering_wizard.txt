This individual was a wizard. In 1996 he was seen whispering into a hole in the wall in Knockturn Alley. It is unknown whether the wizard was out of his mind, or if that hole in the wall had some magical capability that made talking into it reasonable (such as its acting as a sort of magical intercom, or the wall itself being enchanted to be sentient).
