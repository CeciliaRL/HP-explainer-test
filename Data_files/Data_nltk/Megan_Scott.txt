Megan Scott was a British Muggle that lived in Yorkshire.


== Biography ==
She was found unconscious in a Yorkshire graveyard by Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner after she was attacked. Healer Omar Abasi was able to mend her wounds and she explained that her grandmother, who was recently deceased, had given her a map of the area and told to 'seek her past' and that 'Cloke knows the truth'.
Jacturus Cloke III later attacked her and cast the Incarcerous Spell, tying her up. However, Cloke was then driven off by a protective Unicorn.  It was later revealed that he had been hunting the unicorn, attempting to gather valuable hair, horn, and blood from it to restore his family's lost fortune.
Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner were able to set her free, but because of everything she had seen, they ultimately had to Obliviate her. They gave her a chest full of gold and jewels that Horatio Cloke had stashed away when planning to elope with her grandmother, hence her cryptic statement.
