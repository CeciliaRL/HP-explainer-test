Penelope Taylor (born c. 1974) was a Muggle woman from Hull, and a survivor of the Millennium Bridge disaster in 1996, aged 22.
She noticed "these plumes of smoke in the sky", just before the bridge collapsed, which were (although she did not know) a gang of Death Eaters led by Fenrir Greyback. Penelope Taylor attributed the collapse to what she believed were devils, punishing the Londoners for their "decadent Western lifestyle". She escaped the collapse with only a broken leg and pelvis, because she stopped to try and see the smoke, and later gave a statement to The Guardian.
