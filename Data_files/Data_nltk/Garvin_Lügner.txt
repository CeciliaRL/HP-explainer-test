Garvin Lügner (fl. 18th century) was a German warlock who invented the Instant Darkness Powder, presumably intended as a variant of Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder. However, unlike the true substance, which provides absolute darkness, Garvin's powder merely slightly dimmed the lights.
However, this did not discourage Garvin from falsely claiming he had invented the Wand-Lighting Charm, Lumos, to remedy the effects of his powder. The Wand-Lighting Charm was actually invented in 1772, by Levina Monkstanley, a British witch.
