Kevin was a young wizard who attended the Quidditch World Cup final in 1994 with his parents. He played with his father's wand at the campsite, enlarging a slug until his mother caught and stopped him. When she accidentally stepped on the magically enlarged slug, he cried out, "You bust slug! You bust slug!"


== Etymology ==
The name "Kevin" is the anglicised form of the Irish name Caoimhín, derived from the older Irish Cóemgein, composed of the Old Irish elements cóem "kind, gentle, handsome" and gein "birth". Saint Caoimhín established a monastery in Glendalough, Ireland in the 6th century and is the patron saint of Dublin. It became popular in the English-speaking world outside of Ireland in the 20th century.
