Mrs McGregor was a Muggle woman who resided in Caithness, Scotland. She was the daughter of a local farmer, and married the son of another farmer, Dougal McGregor.
Dougal McGregor and his wife were murdered in a random anti-Muggle attack by the Death Eaters during the height of the First Wizarding War in the 1970s, along with their children.
