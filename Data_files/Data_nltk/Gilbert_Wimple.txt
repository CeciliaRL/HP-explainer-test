Gilbert Wimple (fl. 1994) was a  wizard who worked for the Committee on Experimental Charms at the Ministry of Magic.


== Biography ==
Gilbert Wimple was born well before 1994, possibly in Great Britain. He eventually received an education in magic and worked for the Committee on Experimental Charms at the Ministry of Magic. Presumably as a result of working on the Committee, he acquired horns. Wimple attended the 1994 Quidditch World Cup. Arthur Weasley pointed him out to Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger.


== Etymology ==
The name "Gilbert" means "bright pledge", derived from the Germanic elements gisil "pledge, hostage" and beraht "bright". The Normans introduced this name to England, where it was common during the Middle Ages. It was borne by a 12th-century British saint, the founder of the religious order known as the Gilbertines.
Whimple is a village in Devon, near Exeter, where J. K. Rowling went to university. This could be a link to Wimple, as there are other references to places in the area in the books.
