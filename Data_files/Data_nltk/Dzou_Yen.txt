== Behind the scenes ==
Zou Yan (also known as Dzou Yen or Tsou Yen, 305 BC - 240 BC) was a Chinese mystic who lived in the state of Qi during Spring and Autumn Period, an era of political turmoil preceding the total collapse of the Zhou Dynasty. He is considered one of the founders of Chinese scientific thought. He is credited with refining the theories of the Five Elements and Yin and Yang, though his writings are now lost. The main account of his life comes from Sima Qian's Records of the Grand Historian.
