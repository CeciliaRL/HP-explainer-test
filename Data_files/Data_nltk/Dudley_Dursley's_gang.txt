Dudley Dursley led a gang, which was a group of bullies. Dudley was in charge by virtue of being the biggest, strongest, and (according to Harry) stupidest of the lot of them.
In 1995, the gang would roam the streets around Little Whinging harassing other people, such as by throwing stones at passing cars, or beating up young children. They covered their actions by telling their parents they were going to another member of the gang's house for tea every night.

== Behind the scenes ==
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the gang were laughing at Harry who was being taunted by Dudley. They laugh even more when Harry pulls out his wand (as they are unaware it is magical), and they flee in terror when the sky becomes dark. Though all four of them appear in the film, only Piers and Malcolm are credited.
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry makes a snide comment about the bravery of Dudley's gang. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Severus Snape makes a similar comment about James Potter's gang.
