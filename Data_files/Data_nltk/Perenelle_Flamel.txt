Perenelle Flamel (pre 1334 â€“ between 1992 and 1996) was a French witch, the wife of famous Philosopher and Alchemist, Nicolas Flamel, who was known for his creation of the Philosopher's Stone. She became known as one of the oldest witches in history though her use of the Elixir of Life, a life extending potion derived from her husband's creation. 


== Biography ==
She and her husband met at Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in their youth. Perenelle and her husband drank the Elixir of Life produced by the stone, and were functionally immortal until the stone was destroyed in 1992. 
In consultation with Albus Dumbledore, the couple decided to destroy the stone to prevent its use by Lord Voldemort, who had nearly succeeded in stealing the stone for his own purposes within the last year. As they were no longer able to produce the potion, she and Nicolas later died after their current supply ran out. She was at least six hundred and eighty three years old at the time of her death.
Having lived for so long, both Perenelle and her husband were willing to finally embrace death. Albus Dumbledore compared the experience for them to bring like "going to bed after a very long day".


== Relationships ==


=== Nicolas Flamel ===
Perenelle Flamel was the wife of Nicolas Flamel. She, along with her husband, drank the Elixir of Life created by the Philosopher's Stone making her functionally immortal. Nicolas and Perenelle lived happily together for over 600 years. 


=== Albus Dumbledore ===
As her husband was close friends with Albus Dumbledore, Perenelle may have been friends with him as well. 


== Etymology ==
Perenelle is the Old French form on the name Petronilla, a diminutive of the name Petronia, which is the feminine form of Petronius - a Roman family name which is possibly derived from Latin petro, petronis "yokel".
Petro-, of both Latin and Greek origin, is a prefix meaning "of or pertaining to stone."
The name Flamel means in Old French "flame". Such meaning can be associated to Flamel's work as an alchemist.


== Behind the scenes ==
Like her husband, Perenelle Flamel is a genuine historical figure. They were married in 1368 and, at that time, she had already been married twice and brought that inheritance to their union. This fortune, added to the proceeds from Nicolas's businesses made the couple quite wealthy and they were known as generous benefactors. According to historical record, Perenelle Flamel died in 1397. According to a book written in 1612, she was an alchemist in her own right though there is no known historical record of this.
Unlike her husband, Perenelle did not appear in Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, aside from a possible mention.
