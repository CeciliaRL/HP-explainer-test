This was an eagle owl owned by Draco Malfoy. During Malfoy's first year at Hogwarts School, the owl delivered daily packages of sweets from his mother.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is possible that this was a family owl that sent the packages, but as the Malfoys were wealthy, the owl was likely Draco's.
