This British wizard was bitten by a werewolf in late 1995, thus unfortunately becoming one himself.


== Biography ==
He was admitted to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, in the 'Dangerous' Dai Llewellyn Ward. Arthur Weasley was also a patient in St Mungo's at the time, having narrowly survived an attack by Voldemort's snake, Nagini. Arthur's wife Molly was concerned about a werewolf being in a public ward, but Arthur reminded her during their visit that the full moon was still two weeks away at the time. The Healers at St Mungo's spoke with the man, trying to persuade him that he would be able to live an almost normal life. For his part, Arthur spoke with the man and told him that he personally knew a werewolf who was a very decent individual and that they found the condition quite easy to manage. The man apparently grew annoyed with Arthur and angrily told him he would give him another bite if he did not stop talking.
When Harry, Hermione, the Weasleys, and a few members of the Order visited Arthur again on Christmas, fellow werewolf Remus Lupin strolled over to the individual and spoke to him for a while, most likely to explain to him and/or console him over his new condition.
