Sinistra was a wizard or witch.


== Etymology ==
The name "Sinistra" is the name of a star in the constellation Ophiuchus, which probably means that the family, like the House of Black, named their children after those of stars and constellations.


== Behind the scenes ==
Professor Sinistra was apparently considered for the role of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, as the name was written next to those of Enid Pettigrew and Oakden Hernshaw. However, the name was not written with a year next to it, implying that the name may have just been considered.
