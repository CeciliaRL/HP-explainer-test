This Healer was a witch, who was the proprietor of the Healer Shop, a healing station located in Diagon Alley from at least 1991 to 1992.


== Biography ==
An altruistic individual, she offered her services free of charge to all injured persons in Diagon Alley, seeing it as her duty. When not attending to customers, the Healer appeared to have a passion for Divination; she kept what appeared to be a crystal ball on her desk, and consulted what were possibly tarot cards in her free time.


== Behind the scenes ==
Interestingly, both the Healer and her shop are correctly have "Healer" in their names, which was a term that wasn't introduced to the series until the release of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix on 21 June, 2003, even though the game was released on 15 November, 2002. The only term for a healing wizard introduced to the series would've been "Mediwizard" from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. This is likely just a lucky coincidence that happens to line up with the lore.
