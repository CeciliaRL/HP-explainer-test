This foreman was an American No-Maj man who worked at the Moreton Dale Canning Factory during the 1920s while Jacob Kowalski was employed there.
During a visit to The Blind Pig speakeasy in 1926, Jacob remarked that Gnarlak reminded him of his foreman, after punching the disreputable Goblin in the face.
