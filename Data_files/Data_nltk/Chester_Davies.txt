He began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in September 1980 and was placed in Ravenclaw House by the Sorting Hat. He became a Prefect in 1984.
During the 1986–1987 school year, Chester was caught off guard by a Full Body-Bind Curse when he was in front of the Potions Classroom. It was unknown if he was aware that the curse was cast by Jacob's sibling with the coercion of Penny Haywood, or who had revived him afterwards. Later in the school year, when a guest speaker was to arrive at Hogwarts, Chester believed the person to be Ambrosius Flume, the owner of Honeydukes Sweet Shoppe.
Chester graduated from Hogwarts in 1987.
