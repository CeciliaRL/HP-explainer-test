Ugga (fl. 12th century) was a British wizard who lived in the same village as Goodwin Kneen, and played Kwidditch (Quidditch) with him in the role that would become known as a Beater. He was old, and during a match against a team from Ilkley, he failed to intercept a Blooder (Bludger) that hit Radulf in the head.
