Des Pander, also known by the nickname Dutch, was an American wizarding criminal who operated in the 1920s.
In or around 1926, the Magical Congress of the United States of America issued a wanted poster for Dutch, which stated that he was wanted for grand larceny and No-Maj murder. It described him as "most menacing, "extremely dangerous," and a "malicious killer." A reward of 5000 Dragots was offered for information leading to his capture.
