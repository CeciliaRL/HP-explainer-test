Hestia Carrow was a witch and Slytherin student who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1990s. She and her twin sister, Flora were both members of the Slug Club.


== Biography ==


=== 1996-1997 school year ===

Hestia was sorted into Slytherin House along with her identical twin sister, Flora, at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at the age of eleven, and became a member of the Slug Club in the 1996–1997 school year.

Hestia and her sister were seemingly quiet at Slug Club meetings, and both had a fondness for the colour green, which they wore not only as part of their House robes, but by their choosing, as reflected by the formal dresses they wore to the Slug Club Christmas party.


=== 1997-1998 school year ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Flora and Hestia standing behind Pansy Parkinson 		 	 
Hestia was present in the Great Hall prior to the Battle of Hogwarts when classmate Pansy Parkinson urged students to hand over Harry Potter to Lord Voldemort. As she and her sister were underage to fight in the battle, they likely departed the school along with most other members of their house before the battle started.


== Etymology ==
"Hestia" comes from the Greek Ἑστία (estía, meaning "hearth"). Hestia is the Greek goddess of the hearth, architecture, the right ordering of domesticity, the family, and the state. She is therefore one of the more mighty Greek gods.


== Behind the scenes ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Actresses Amber and Ruby Evans with director David Yates on the set of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince 		 	 
This character is only introduced in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and Part 1 and Part 2 of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
Hestia Carrow is portrayed by actress Ruby Evans.
Both she and her sister Flora were likely invited to join the Slug Club due to their pure-blood heritage (and perhaps a devotion to Slytherin House, possibly indicated by their fondness for green). The Carrow family are one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, meaning they are one of the twenty-eight pure-blooded families left in Great Britain.
It is likely that the Carrow twins are related to Alecto and Amycus Carrow, as all four of them have Greco-Roman forenames and the same surname.
