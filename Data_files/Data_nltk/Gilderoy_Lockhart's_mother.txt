Mrs Lockhart was the witch mother of Gilderoy Lockhart, former celebrity and Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and two older Squib daughters.


== Biography ==
Mrs Lockhart was very ambitious for her son, and encouraged him in the belief that he was a remarkable person â€” something that showed in her rather flashy choice of name for her son. Her overly pampering nature for her son, especially after discovering that he is her only child to have magical powers, caused his vanity to grow like a tenacious weed, which led to his obnoxious, attention-seeking nature that branched off into ignorance, laziness, skill deterioration, fraudulence and eventually self-induced amnesia.
The Healer who looked after Lockhart, Miriam Strout, stated he never got visitors in December 1995. This suggests that his mother was deceased by then, considering the doting affection she showed for her son, or that she came to despise his obnoxiousness and vanity. However, it is unlikely that she and the rest of the family ever knew about how far Lockhart went in his desire for attention, as Dumbledore never outright publicised it and the fact that Dumbledore would reveal it to Lockhart's family of all people would be uncharacteristically cruel for him.
