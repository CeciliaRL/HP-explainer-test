== Etymology ==
"Mathilda" is a variation of the name "Matilda", deriving from the Old High German words mahta, meaning "might", and hildr, meaning "battle".
"Greenford" is the name of a suburb of the London Borough of Ealing. The suburb's name derives from the Old English grÄ“ne and ford, together meaning "place at the green ford". (A "ford" is a part of a river which is shallow enough to cross without a bridge, and "green" in the context of place-names usually means a grassy field, especially a common.)
