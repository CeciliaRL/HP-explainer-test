Felicitania Tugwood was a witch who lived in Britain in the 1990s.


== Behind the scenes ==

On Evening Prophet prop featured in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, this witch is mentioned to have been involved in a broom accident caused by Armando Dippet while Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley flew a Ford Anglia to Hogwarts Castle (a breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy): Dippet had crashed into her, and she in turn knocked the Pidgron sisters off their broomstick on her descent into the River Mersey, after which she got a "shocking" case of flu.
This, however, cannot be considered canon, since Rowling's statements and books imply that Dippet has been dead since the 1950s.
