This man was the Muggle stepfather of Dean Thomas.


== Biography ==
He married Dean's mother some time after she was abandoned by her first husband. They had several children together and lived happily in London.
After Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord Voldemort in 1995, Dean consciously avoided telling his parents about the event, presumably because he did not want them to pull him out of Hogwarts, although it also seemed likely the same murderer would be coming after their son as well, hence he did not wish to fill his parents with unneeded dread.
When Dean was forced to go into hiding during the Second Wizarding War, Mr Thomas and his wife did not know where he had gone, and feared the worst, so Potterwatch broadcasted a request urging anyone who was with Dean to order him to please contact his family.


== Behind the scenes ==
It may have been possible that Dean Thomas' story could have been partially inspired by the song "Colour Him Father" by an American group The Winstons, which tells of a young man respecting his stepfather who cares for him and several siblings. The stepfather married a war widow, as the narrator says his true father "was killed in the war", akin to Dean Thomas' father being killed by Voldemort.
