She grew up hearing about Broomstick Regulations and other equally exciting Ministry details from her father.


== Etymology ==
Lucy is a name of Latin origin, meaning "light". It is a feminine form of both Lucius and Luke; it is also a vernacular form of Lucia. The feast day of Saint Lucy (fourth century), patroness of sight, is called the Festival of Light in Sweden. Lucy can also be short for Lucille.


== Behind the scenes ==
Lucy's first name may be a tribute to Lucy Pevensie, a character from the Chronicles of Narnia, written by one of J.K. Rowling's favourite authors, C.S. Lewis.
