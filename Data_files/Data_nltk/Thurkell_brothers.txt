The Thurkell brothers (fl. 17th century) were the seven sons of Thaddeus Thurkell. They all turned out to be Squibs. This made their wizard father so angry that he transfigured them into hedgehogs out of disgust.
It is rare for a single Squib to be born into a wizarding family. The fact that all seven of the Thurkell brothers were non-magical seems to indicate that there was something out of the ordinary about their case.
