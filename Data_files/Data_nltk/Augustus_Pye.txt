Augustus Pye was a British wizard and trainee Healer at St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries in the Dai Llewellyn Ward. He was interested in Muggle healing techniques, and used stitches on Arthur Weasley when he was admitted to the hospital after he was attacked by Nagini. Presumably, Nagini's venom made Arthur's wounds impossible to heal in this manner.
During the Calamity, Pye taught trainee Magizoologists how to master the Stamina Charm, to help them restore stamina to themselves in combat.


== Etymology ==
The name "Augustus" means "great" or "venerable", derived from Latin augere "to increase". Augustus was the title given to Octavian, the first Roman emperor. He was the adopted son of Julius Caesar who rose to power through a combination of military skill and political prowess. This was also the name of three kings of Poland.
