These two elderly women were witches and members of the Wizengamot in the mid-1990s. They seemed to be friendly with Albus Dumbledore, and were not influenced by the Ministry's campaign to discredit Dumbledore and Harry Potter. On 12 August, they were present at Harry Potter's disciplinary hearing. When Dumbledore arrived at Courtroom Ten as witness for the defence, these two witches waved to him as a welcome.


== Behind the scenes ==
One of these two witches may be Professor Griselda Marchbanks, who knew Dumbledore since his youth and was one of the Wizengamot elders at the time of the hearing.
