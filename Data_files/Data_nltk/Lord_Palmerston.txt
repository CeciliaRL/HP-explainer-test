Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston (20 October, 1784 â€“ 18 October, 1865) was the Muggle Prime Minister from 6 February, 1855 to 19 February, 1858 and again from 12 June, 1859 to 18 October, 1865.
The Minister for Magic, Priscilla Dupont, developed an irrational loathing of him. This attained such proportions that it ended up in her being forced to step down on 17 February, 1858, after such incidents as coins turning to frogspawn in his coat pockets.
Ironically, Palmerston was forced to resign by the Muggles two days later on 19 February, 1858. He was later reelected on 12 June, 1859 and died in office.
