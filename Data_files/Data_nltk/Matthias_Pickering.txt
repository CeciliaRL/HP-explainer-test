Matthias Pickering was a wizard and the grandfather of the Pickering siblings. 


== Biography ==
Matthias was a cruel and greedy wizard who would turn violent whenever his granddaughter, Constance, angered him, which was often. Despite that, Constance's parents always sided with him. He was wealthy and knew a lot of powerful witches and wizards, so family always did whatever they could to keep him happy.
He loved to tell the story of how, after the Ironbelly dragon at Gringotts was released during the break-in in 1998, they had to change the location of the family vault because theirs was destroyed by dragon detritus.
Matthias was a selfish wizard who founded The Unforgivable to make himself rich and powerful. He recruited only wealthy and influential wizards with the promise of more money and power. They did terrible things to get ahead with no concern for anyone but themselves. The moment Constance discovered The Unforgivable existed, she decided she could put the organisation and their resources to better use. She decided that she could make a difference and help those truly in need. She made Matthias disappear, by hiding him, alive and mostly unharmed, inside the big trunk in her room. She then used Polyjuice Potion to assume his appearance and then take the place of its leader.
In November 2021, following Constance's arrest, the Aurors searched her apartment and found Matthias under the effect of a Draught of Living Death, but otherwise unharmed. The Ministry has taken him into custody.
