Mr Evans (died between 1 September 1971 and 31 October 1981) was a British Muggle and the father of Petunia and Lily Evans. He had two grandsons, Dudley Dursley and Harry Potter, through his daughters' marriages to Vernon Dursley and James Potter.


== Biography ==
Mr Evans and his wife lived in Cokeworth, England. The couple had two daughters: Petunia, born in the late 1950s, and Lily, born 30 January 1960.
The couple's elder daughter was a Muggle like them. Their younger daughter, on the other hand, turned out to be a Muggle-born witch. Mr Evans and his wife were proud to have a magical daughter, but Petunia thought differently, considering her sister to be a "freak." According to Petunia, Mr and Mrs Evans favoured Lily, talking about her constantly.
On 1 September, 1971, Mr Evans and his wife took Lily and Petunia to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, in order to see Lily off to her first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


=== Death and legacy ===
Mr Evans and his wife died "normal Muggle death[s]" sometime before the murder of their daughter Lily and son-in-law James Potter, on the night of 31 October, 1981. This meant that their grandson, Harry Potter was left in the care of Petunia, his only surviving blood relation.
