Bruno Schmidt was a German wizard who, according to Newt Scamander in his 1991 edition of his book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, was the last person known to have been attacked by an Erkling. As a six-year-old child, he managed to kill the Erkling who attacked him, hitting it over the head with his father's Collapsible Cauldron.
