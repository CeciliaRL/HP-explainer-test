This was a black owl that belonged to Sirius Black, which he sent to deliver a letter to Harry Potter in late 1994. The owl had an unfortunate tendency of biting people, and was one of the many exotic birds that Sirius used to deliver letters to Harry, as Hedwig was easily recognisable.


== Behind the scenes ==
Director Mike Newell wanted a black owl, which simply do not exist. The animal grooming department used a non-toxic food colouring to actually paint a brown owl's feathers to create a black owl.
