== Biography ==
Edward Scot was presumably born somewhere in the British Isles or Ireland, in 1988 or earlier. Following the completion of his magical education, he went on to work for the British Ministry of Magic in the Department of International Magical Co-operation, eventually becoming a Lead Liaison Minister.
At some point thereafter, he became acquainted with a research assistant at the Auror Office by the name of Grim Fawley, and  in 2015, when five prominent members of the wizarding community suddenly disappeared without a trace, Edward was already working at the Ministry; around which time his name appeared on a handwritten list penned down by Fawley of the 'suspects' whom he held a grudge against; indicating that he was somehow involved in the London Five investigation.  
Around January of 2021, Scot received word from the French Ministry of Magic that it had registered a large breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy after major non-magical news outlet had published the first in a series of expos√©s that threatened to expose the existence of magic, as the Muggle reporter, Brice Badeaux, documented Calamity activity and released his findings to the masses; having even successfully photographed a local agent of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force in the process of returning Foundables. Serving as the Calamity World Centre at the time, Edward notified members of the Calamity Management Team and the local branch of the SOS Task Force, passing on the French Ministry's request for their assistance in containing the situation.
