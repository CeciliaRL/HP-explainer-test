== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
This boy was presumably born in the Muggle part of Ottery St Catchpole, a village in Devon, England, and still lived there in 1997.


=== Wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour ===
In order to disguise Harry Potter during the wedding of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour on 1 August, 1997, Fred Weasley stole a few hairs from the head of this boy with the Summoning Charm. It was used to make Polyjuice Potion for Harry to take on his form. This boy's hair was red in colour, making it possible for Harry to pass as a Weasley cousin. He was also slightly plump, as Harry mentioned being uncomfortable in his dress robes, for the boy he impersonated was slightly fatter than him. However, it should be noted that Harry was rather thin.
