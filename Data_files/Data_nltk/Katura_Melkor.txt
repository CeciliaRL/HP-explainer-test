Katura Melkor was an American wizarding criminal who operated in the 1920s.


== Biography ==
In or around 1926, the Magical Congress of the United States of America issued a wanted poster for Melkor, which stated that she was wanted for "No-Maj smuggling and murder." It described her as a "vicious witch" and a "malicious killer," and warned that she was "bearing wand, most menacing and extremely dangerous." The poster promised a reward of 3500 Dragots for information leading to her capture. This poster was hanging in The Blind Pig when Newt Scamander visited in December 1926.
