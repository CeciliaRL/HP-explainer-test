Erica Stainwright was born in 1932 into parents of unknown blood status.
She became rich selling supposed "cleaning" potions, such as Everklena, but fell into disgrace when it was discovered that these products actually spawned more mould and grime, which presumably forced people to buy more of them to try to fix the problem.


=== Death and Post-Mortem ===
Stainwright died in 2001 at the age of 68 or 69.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Potions: Stainwright was a talented professional potioneer, given how she successfully created her own product range of cleaning potions such as Everklena, on the market and managed to make a good living out of selling them. However, these potions were fraudulent solutions which actually spawned mould and grime as opposed to eradicating it.
