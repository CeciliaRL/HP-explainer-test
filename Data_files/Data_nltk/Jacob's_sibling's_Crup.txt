This Crup belonged to Jacob's sibling and was purchased shortly before the tricks exhibition.


== Biography ==
Rubeus Hagrid had intended to give one of his crups to the student for training before the competition but then realised that all of them had been spoken for. However, Jacob's sibling purchased this crup from another source and trained them to do a perfect roll over. This trick won the pair the competition.


== Behind the scenes ==
Several Cruppy varieties are available for purchase in the game. However, the player has to first purchase the Cruppy with the default look before being able to select other varieties. This pet may be purchased before the quest begins, resulting in some dialogue changes.
