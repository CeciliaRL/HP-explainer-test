== Biography ==
When Harry Potter was given a torch by a Muggle student, he brought it to the professor's classroom, thinking it might be the right place for it. Instead of the teacher, he met his assistant and the torch was included in the artefact collection. He left at some point before the 1996–1997 school year, and was possibly replaced by Professor Charity Burbage.
