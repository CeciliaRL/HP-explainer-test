Burgock was a Goblin who worked at Gringotts Wizarding Bank at some point in 1989 or 1990. Like most goblins, he was rather suspicious of most wizards, including the Hogwarts students that visited the bank looking for Bill Weasley. He did, however, appear quite friendly with his colleague and fellow goblin, Odbert.
Burgock suffered from a bronze allergy; for that reason, he made an effort to propose the abolishment of the knut.
