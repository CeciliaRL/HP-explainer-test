Chris Huhne was a British politician and the environment spokesman for the Liberal Party in the 1990s. In July of 1996, the leader of the party, Sir Menzies, resigned from his post and Huhne (whose supporters briefed against Sir Menzies) announced his candidacy to the leadership of the party, as did Nick Clegg, home affairs spokesman. These events were covered by The Guardian.


== Behind the scenes ==
The listing of Chris Huhne as a candidate to the leadership of the Liberal Party in 1996 is anachronistic, as at the time Huhne had not yet started his political career, and was a City entrepreneur.
