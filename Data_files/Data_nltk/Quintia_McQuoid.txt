Quintia McQuoid (died c. 1407) was a notable Medieval witch and Potioneer, active in, at least, the early 15th century.


== Biography ==
She died at a young age, after consuming a cure for ague that had been improperly brewed. To honour her memory, the Wizarding Schools Potions Championship was first held, in an enchanted garden, in 1407, and has been held every seven years since, gathering Potions students from schools like Hogwarts, Mahoutokoro, Uagadou, and Koldovstoretz.
