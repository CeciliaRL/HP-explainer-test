Sendelina de la Felino was a Spanish witch who played as Keeper on the Spanish National Quidditch team in 1994.
During the 1996–1997 school year, Felino's Chocolate Frog Card could be won by beating Alannis Shepley at a Quidditch challenge.


== Behind the scenes ==
In Spanish, felino is a male gender word, and la is a female gender article. Technically, the correct writing of Sendelina's surname is del Felino, or just Felino.
However, this surname might refer to Sendelina's ancestors. De la Felino can mean "he/she who belongs to the Felino woman". This surname may have originated as a nickname for the child of a woman surnamed "Felino". Therefore, a son of hers would be called, for example, "José el de la Felino" (José, the son of that Felino woman), and through the generations, the nickname would have evolved to an official surname, "de la Felino".
