This wizard was seen in the Leaky Cauldron in 1993, reading the Muggle physics book A Brief History of Time by Stephen W. Hawking while performing wandless magic on his cup of coffee, causing it to stir itself.


== Magical abilities and skills ==
Wandless magic: This wizard was capable of stirring a cup of coffee magically by simply using his hand, which is highly advanced and difficult magic to accomplish.


== Behind the scenes ==
This wizard was portrayed by Ian Brown in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban in a celebrity cameo.
His reading of a book titled A Brief History of Time is likely foreshadowing for the use of time travel later in the film. 
Said book was published in 1990 in real life. Therefore, it can't be suggested as a proof that the wizard might actually be a time traveller himself since the scene is placed in 1993.
He does not appear in the Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban book.
