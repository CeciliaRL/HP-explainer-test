George Osborne was a British politician and Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in the mid-to-late 1990s (during Alistair Darling's time as Chancellor of the Exchequer). In July of 1996, Darling announced "controversial changes" to the capital gains tax. As the protests grew louder, Osborne said his party would be campaigning to overturn this measure. These events were covered by The Guardian.


== Behind the scenes ==
The listing of George Osborne as the Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1996 is anachronistic, as Osborne was only appointed to the office in 2005. Indeed, at the time, Gordon Brown was the one who held the post.
