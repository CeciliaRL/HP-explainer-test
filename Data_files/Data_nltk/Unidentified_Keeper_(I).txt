He started his education in 1980 and was Sorted into an unknown House. At some point before or during the 1985–1986 school year, he became the Keeper of his House Quidditch team.
He continued playing on the team the following year and was well known for making bad Keeper related puns.
He later went on to play Quidditch professionally after graduating from Hogwarts. Ethan Parkin recruited him as the Keeper for Wigtown Wanderers' reserve team, after watching him play in the 1986–1987 school year's final.
