The Pidgron sisters were three witches who had "quite a bit of padding in the bottom department". They lived in Britain in the 1990s.


== Behind the scenes ==

On Evening Prophet prop featured in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the Pidgron sisters are mentioned to have been involved in a broom accident caused by Armando Dippet while Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley flew a Ford Anglia to Hogwarts Castle (a breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy): when elderly Armando Dippet dropped some bread from his broomstick, he lost his focus and accidentally crashed into Felicitania Tugwood who, in turn, managed to fall on the broomsticks of the Pidgron sisters, who were knocked off their brooms. While Tugwood fell into the Mersey, the sisters fell on something soft and this, combined with the fact that had "quite a bit of padding in the bottom department", prevented them from having any injuries.
This, however, cannot be considered canon, since Rowling's statements and books imply that Dippet has been dead since the 1950s.
