These four burly servants were lackeys to the tyrannical Earl of Paunchley in the 15th century.
In 1484, when the Earl decided to hold a Jousting tournament on his castle grounds and decreed it mandatory for all Poppleton villagers to attend, a young boy Edmund Gaddlegate fell from a tree and broke his leg. His mother put him to bed and sent word to the Earl that her son would not be able to attend the match. The Earl responded by sending his four burly henchmen to drag Edmund and his mother to the castle. There, the Earl informed Edmund's mother that as punishment for his mistake, Edmund would be tied to a horse and forced to joust against him, as well as all the knights who had gathered to compete.
