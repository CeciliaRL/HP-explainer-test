This centaur was a member of the Forbidden Forest Centaur colony.


== Biography ==
During the Skirmish in the Forbidden Forest in 1996, he grabbed Harry Potter as he and the other centaurs tried to figure out to do with him and Hermione Granger. When Hermione suggested that they help them, this centaur roared that they did not help Humans. An Unidentified dun-coloured centaur suggested that they go with Dolores Umbridge. Luckily, the giant Grawp chased them away.
