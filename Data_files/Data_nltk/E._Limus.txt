E. Limus was a witch or wizard who worked as a reporter and columnist for the Daily Prophet. In 1993, Limus wrote an article on how Sirius Black, then believed to be a fugitive mass-murderer, had been sighted near Dufftown. By 1995, Limus had a column on page five of the paper, presumably dedicated to advice or opinion. In mid-1997, his column moved to page six.
Limus also wrote the book Olde and Forgotten Bewitchments and Charmes.
