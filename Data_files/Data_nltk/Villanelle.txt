Madam Villanelle was a witch who worked at Flourish and Blotts in the 1980s and early 1990s. She was noted to be a skilled linguist.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Villanelle bought her first wand from Garrick Ollivander.


=== 1988–1989 school year ===
In late 1988, she met Jacob's sibling, who visited the shop in order to find clues about their brother.
The following year, Jacob visited the shop and bought some books about the Mahoutokoro School of Magic. Jacob's sibling visited the shop shortly afterwards and asked Madam Villanelle about their brother's visit.


=== 1989–1990 school year ===
At some point near the end of the 1989–1990 school year, Villanelle told Jacob's sibling and Mundungus Fletcher information of a dark witch who had been gathering information about Jacob's sibling and their wand (who turned out to be the Dark Witch in Knockturn Alley).


=== 1990–1991 school year ===
During the 1990–1991 school year, Villanelle used Xeep's Luscious Locks Solution and lost some memories due to the memory-erasing properties of it. Jacob's sibling and Ben Copper paid her a visit during their investigation of Garrick Ollivander's misfiring wand. Villanelle was later given the counter-serum, which stopped the effects of the potion on her memory.


== Possessions ==
Wand: Villanelle owned a wand of unknown specifications, that was manufactured and sold by Garrick Ollivander in his shop Ollivanders.
