Henry VIII (28 June 1491 â€“ 28 January 1547) was a Muggle who reigned as King of England from 1509 until his death.


== Biography ==
His second wife, Anne Boleyn, was believed to have been a witch by Muggles, but may have actually been a Squib.
Mary I was his daughter by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, whom he divorced. Elizabeth I was Henry's daughter by Anne Boleyn.


== Etymology ==
The name "Henry" comes from the Germanic name Heimirich which meant "home ruler", composed of the elements heim "home" and ric "power, ruler". It was later commonly spelled Heinrich, with the spelling altered due to the influence of other Germanic names like Haganrich, in which the first element is hagan "enclosure".
