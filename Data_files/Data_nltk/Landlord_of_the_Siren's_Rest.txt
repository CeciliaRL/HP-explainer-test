The Siren's Rest's landlord was the Muggle owner of the Siren's Rest pub.


== Biography ==
Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner investigated his story of bring attacked by a 50-foot-long magical beast while fishing in the nearby lake. His fishing pole bore the marks of the magical beast which he hoped would help draw patrons to his pub. His spectacles, which he lost during the encounter, were later retrieved by the Ministry investigators at the bottom of the lake, with marks of suckers on them.
When visiting monster hunter Laura Thorn went missing he drew a map and rounded up some local lads to go find her. After Ministry investigators Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner (in the guise of people from "the lake safety commission") retrieved Thorn and sent her to St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, the Landlord agreed to call off the Muggle mob, but expressed his intention to contact the newspapers with information about the monster from the lake (his ultimate goal to "make a fortune off monster-seeking tourists"). Ultimately, he had to be Obliviated to prevent a breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.
