Emily Mather was a witch reported missing along with her relative, Gabriella, on the Potterwatch radio programme in 1997. Her disappearance was most likely linked to a Death Eater attack.


== Behind the scenes ==
This character is presumably a tribute to a relative of James Mather, who worked as a supervising sound editor on every Harry Potter film from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix onward.
She may be related to New England Mather family, of whom, Increase, who, along with his son was responsible for several writings and involvement in the Salem Witch Trials. Increase's father, Richard, was born in Lancashire, England.
