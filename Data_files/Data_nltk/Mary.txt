Mary, also known as Saint Mary or the Virgin Mary, was the mother Jesus, the son of God according to the Bible and the central figure of Christianity. She was venerated as a saint in the Catholic, Anglican, and Eastern Orthodox churches. 
St. Mary's Church Hall, where Emanuel and Kay Hurwitz once performed along with the Dollis Chamber Ensemble, was presumably named after her.

One of the known works by artist Haniball Carathi was a "little piece" depicting "our Ladie" (i.e., Mary) with the presumably infant Jesus "upon her right hand." A catalogue listing for this work was incorporated into the label of the Belch Powder box.
A medallion depicting Mary was among the many objects scattered about the interior of the old bell tower near the Chudley Cannons' training grounds.


== Etymology ==
The name "Mary" is the usual English form of Maria, which was the Latin form of the New Testament Greek names Μαριάμ (Mariam) and Μαρία (Maria) - the spellings are interchangeable - which were from the Hebrew name מִרְיָם (Miryam). The meaning is not known for certain, but there are several theories including "sea of bitterness", "rebelliousness", and "wished for child". However it was most likely originally an Egyptian name, perhaps derived in part from mry, "beloved" or mr, "love".
