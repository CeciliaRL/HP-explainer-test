Professor Marlowe Forfang (fl. late 1800s) was an English wizard and a great authority on werewolves. He studied werewolves for a long time, being the first to undertake a comprehensive study of their habits. From his study, he concluded that most werewolves are wizardkind; Muggles "taste" different than wizards to a werewolf, and are much more likely to die from their injuries rather than be turned.
