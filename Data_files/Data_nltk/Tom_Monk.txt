Tom Monk (b. 20 May, 1995) was a Muggle boy, the son of Dave and Tilly Monk, and the twin brother of Jack.


== Biography ==
In 1995, Tom Monk and his brother were born prematurely, delivered simultaneously as what their father described as a "bundle," and received immediate medical care from "an amazing neonatal team." The twins were quickly taken to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, where they were kept in incubators, receiving vital fluids through intravenous lines and breathing with the help of mechanical ventilators. Five days after his birth, Tom's condition was stable enough for his mother to hold him in her arms for the first time, which gave her a "huge boost." The twins' parents were finally able to take them home after twelve weeks. By this time, Tom weighed three-and-a-half pounds, having weighed only one pound, one ounce at birth.
The twins' father wrote an article about their miraculous birth, which was featured on the front page of the 12 August, 1995 issue of Metro, under the title "Miracle babies make it".
