Henry Willis, also known as "Father" Willis (27 April 1821 â€“ 11 February 1901) was a British organ builder, the foremost of the Victorian era.
There was an organ built by Henry Willis at the City Hall, in New York. In 1926, during Henry Shaw Junior's re-election fundraising dinner, a strange, haunting noise started to issue from the organ pipes at the end of the room, interrupting Shaw's speech, just before a huge and bestial rush of wind burst forth from beneath the organ, smashing up the party and killing Shaw.
