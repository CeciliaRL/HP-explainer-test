Aliko Okoye was a Nigerian witch who played as a Beater for the 2014 Nigerian National Quidditch team.


== Biography ==
During the second match of the 427th Quidditch World Cup, against Fiji, Okoye and her fellow Beater Mercy Ojukwu were more "ferocious" than the Fijian Beaters, Quintia Qarase and Narinder Singh. This resulted in the Bludgers doing much harm to the Fijian Chasers, which contributed to that team's bruising defeat.
During the fourth quarter-final match, against Japan, Okoye, along with fellow Beater Ojukwu, put on a master class of Bludger work, as did rival Beaters Shingo and Hongo. It was for this reason that special Quidditch correspondent to the Daily Prophet Ginny Potter called the match the "Battle of the Beaters".
