Gwendoline Babcocke was a Scottish witch that worked as a shop assistant at The Magic Neep in Hogsmeade.


== Biography ==
She received several notes and gifts such as chocolates and lavender perfume from an anonymous admirer, including an night-time invitation to the Boathouse at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry which caught fire just as she arrived.
Enamoured with dragons, she owned a copy of Dragon Breeding for Pleasure and Profit but would never leave Hogsmeade to work with them as it would break her mum's heart. In addition to her interest in magical beasts, she said she was a natural at the Stinging Jinx.
