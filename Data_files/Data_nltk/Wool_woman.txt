This woman was a British witch, who in her elderly years became a resident at St Oswald's Home for Old Witches and Wizards. She was present in St Oswalds on 1 September, 2020, when Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy abandoned the Hogwarts Express to come looking for Amos Diggory. When the boys asked her where Amos could be found, she in return asked them why they would wish to see such a "miserable old sod".
