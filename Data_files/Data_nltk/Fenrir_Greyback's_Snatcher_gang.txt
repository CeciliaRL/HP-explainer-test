Greyback's gang 		 	 
Fenrir Greyback's gang of Snatchers was the most prominent snatcher gang in Britain. There were seven members of this gang, including Scabior.


== History ==
In 1998, this gang captured Dean Thomas and Griphook and also killed their companions, Gornuk, Dirk Cresswell and Ted Tonks. This group then caught Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. They almost fell for their lies but then realised who they caught and brought them to Malfoy Manor. When there, one snatcher got into a disagreement with Bellatrix Lestrange and all were stunned except for Greyback. Bellatrix then planned to kill them, but never did because they escaped when she was punished by Voldemort. Later, Every member of this gang fought in the Battle of Hogwarts. Six were killed when the Wooden Bridge collapsed, and what happened to Greyback is unknown. He was either killed, escaped back to his pack or was caught and sent to Azkaban.
