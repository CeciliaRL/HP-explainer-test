Audrey Weasley (maiden name unknown) was the wife of Percy Weasley. The couple had two daughters, Molly and Lucy. It is possible that one or both of their daughters were attending or starting at Hogwarts in 2017, due to the fact that her husband Percy was at King's Cross Station on September 1st that year.
While it is unknown as to whether or not she worked at the Ministry, Audrey knew all their rules and regulations in detail, thanks to her husband.
