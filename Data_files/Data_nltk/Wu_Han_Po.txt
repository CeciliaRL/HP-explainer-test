Wu Han Po, also known by the nickname Silver Dragon, was an American wizarding criminal who operated in the 1920s.
In 1926, the Magical Congress of the United States of America issued a wanted poster for Han Po, which stated that he was wanted for No-Maj smuggling and murder, and described him as "bearing wand and extremely dangerous." A reward of 4,500 Dragots was offered for his arrest.
