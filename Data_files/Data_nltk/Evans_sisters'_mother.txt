Mrs Evans (died between 1 September 1971 and 31 October 1981) was a Muggle woman and the mother of Petunia and Lily Evans. Through Petunia, she was the maternal grandmother of Dudley Dursley, and through Lily, the maternal grandmother of Harry Potter and great-grandmother of Lily Luna, Albus Severus and James Sirius Potter.


== Biography ==
Mrs Evans and her husband lived in Cokeworth, England. The couple had two daughters: Petunia, born in the late 1950s, and Lily, born 30 January 1960.
While Petunia was a Muggle like her parents, Lily turned out to be a Muggle-born witch, something that made Mr and Mrs Evans proud. Petunia, on the other hand, was jealous, considering her sister a "freak." According to Petunia, Mr and Mrs Evans favoured Lily, talking about her constantly.
On 1 September 1971, Mrs Evans and her husband took Lily and Petunia to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, in order to see Lily off to her first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


=== Death and legacy ===
Mrs Evans and her husband died "normal Muggle death[s]" sometime before the murder of their daughter Lily and son-in-law James Potter, on the night of 31 October, 1981. This meant that their grandson by Lily, Harry Potter was left in the care of Petunia, his only surviving blood relation.
