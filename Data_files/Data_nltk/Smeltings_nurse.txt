This female (c. 1994) was a woman employed by the Smeltings Academy of Great Britain sometime in or, possibly, before 1994.


== Biography ==
Sometime in or before 1976 this woman was born to a Muggle family. She eventually was hired by the Smeltings Academy of Great Britain, and worked for the school as a nurse.
In 1994, she sent a letter to the Dursley family about Dudley's considerable weight. The letter informed them that the school no longer had knickerbockers large enough to fit him, and included a diet sheet comprised mostly of fruits and vegetables.


== Personality and traits ==
Little is known of this woman's personality; however, it seemed that she was a fairly caring person as she not only was hired by a school, but was troubled enough by the weight of Dudley Dursley that she sent a letter and a diet sheet to the Dursley home to try and get the family to help Dudley lose weight.
