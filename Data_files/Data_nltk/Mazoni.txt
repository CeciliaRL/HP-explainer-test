Professor Mazoni presumably taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 2010s.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the original West End production of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, Mazoni was played by Nuno Silva.
This character only appears in the play programme and not the published Harry Potter and the Cursed Child script book, so the role may have been added later than the development of the rehearsal script.
