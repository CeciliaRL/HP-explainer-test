A hawk-like owl could be seen at times perched in one of two aged crab-apple trees in the front garden of the Lovegoods' home. It is unknown if any wizard owned this owl, but it may have belonged to the Lovegoods.


== Behind the scenes ==
This may be the owl Xenophilius Lovegood used to deliver a message to the Death Eaters to inform them that Harry Potter was in his house.
This owl may be a Northern Hawk Owl (Surnia ulula), a species known for its similarities with hawks.
It is not a Eurasian Eagle Owl as the text describes it as small, while this species is one of the world's largest.
