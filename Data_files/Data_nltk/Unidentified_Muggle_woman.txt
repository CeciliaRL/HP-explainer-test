This elderly Muggle woman lived in London in the early 1990s.


== Biography ==
In August 1993, this elderly woman was almost run over by the Knight Bus, in which Harry Potter had been travelling at the time, whilst she was crossing a London street, with the support of her zimmer-frame. Due to Dre Head's warning, the bus, driven by Ernie Prang, narrowly avoided hitting her by stopping at the last moment. Dre Head counted back from ten (including three and a half and one and three quarters) to give Ernie Prang the exact second to take off once more.
