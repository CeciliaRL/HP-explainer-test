This individual was a wizard and member of the Wizengamot in the mid-1990s. He was dumpy and heavily-moustached. On 12 August, he was present at Harry Potter's disciplinary hearing, appearing highly sceptical of Arabella Figg's testimony, whispering about it to the witch sitting next to him. He and his neighbour later voted in favour of Harry's conviction.
