Nagnok was a Gringotts goblin who was accidentally killed by an untrained Security Troll sent by the Ministry of Magic, sometime in or before the 18th century. His accidental death was a catalyst to one of many Goblin Rebellions in the 17th and 18th centuries.


== Behind the scenes ==
InThe Wizarding World of Harry Potter, one can see an office at Gringotts Wizarding Bank bearing Nagnok's name on the door. While it is true that Nagnok worked at Gringotts, it is unusual that his office still bears his name, around at least 200 years after his death. Though this may be a different Goblin with the same first name.
