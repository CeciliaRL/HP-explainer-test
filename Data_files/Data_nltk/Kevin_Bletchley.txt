Kevin Bletchley was a wizard who attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He was sorted into Slytherin and played as Keeper on the Slytherin Quidditch team.


== Etymology ==
"Kevin" is the anglicised form of the Irish name Caoimhín, derived from the older Irish Cóemgein, composed of the Old Irish elements cóem "kind, gentle, handsome" and gein "birth". Saint Caoimhín established a monastery in Glendalough, Ireland in the 6th century and is the patron saint of Dublin. It became popular in the English-speaking world outside of Ireland in the 20th century.
Bletchley is a small Market town (now situated within Milton Keynes) in Buckinghamshire - home of Bletchley Park, the enigma code breaking machine.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is very likely that Kevin Bletchley was actually intended to be Miles Bletchley, the Slytherin Keeper from the novels and films, but it is also possible that Miles does not exist in this game.
