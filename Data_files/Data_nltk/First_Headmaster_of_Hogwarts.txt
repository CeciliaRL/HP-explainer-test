This individual (fl. circa 11th century) was the first Head of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, as none of the Founders ever held that title. It is unknown how he came about to be Headmaster, but a statue of him was kept inside the castle in his memory.

 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Some girls by his statue 		 	 
During the 1992â€“1993 school year, a group of girls were seen studying and reading books by his statue, before Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington passed and they looked up.
In 1998, his statue replaced by the one of the Architect of Hogwarts at the Entrance Hall. It is presumed the statue was destroyed in the Battle of Hogwarts, as the ceiling above it came to collapse and, later on in the battle, all that was in the spot was a pile of rubble. For unknown reasons, a statue of him was stored in the Room of Hidden Things.
