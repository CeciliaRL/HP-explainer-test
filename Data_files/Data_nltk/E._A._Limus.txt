E. A. Limus was an American wizard or witch who worked as the Federal Identity Commissioner and Chief Auror at the Magical Congress of the United States of America in the 1920s.
As Federal Identity Commissioner, their job involved keeping records of MACUSA employees and certifying employee identification. As such, their signature appeared on the identification card of Porpentina Goldstein, a worker in the Wand Permit Office.
As Chief Auror, they were presumably partly responsible for overseeing the work of American Aurors. Their signature appeared on wanted posters as certification.
