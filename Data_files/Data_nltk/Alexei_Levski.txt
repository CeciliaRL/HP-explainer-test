== Behind the scenes ==
In the books, this character is known only by his surname. His first name is given as "Alexei" on a Famous Wizard Card in the video game version of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.
Alternatively, a spoof article by Sports Illustrated about the Quidditch World Cup gives his first name as Jakob.
One of Bulgaria's most popular football teams is named after Vasil Levski, which creates additional allusions of Quidditch being the football counterpart of the wizarding community.
