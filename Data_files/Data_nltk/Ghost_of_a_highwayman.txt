This ghost of a highwayman resided at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. In 1993, he jumped through a window in the Entrance Hall on his ghost horse, sending ghostly debris flying without doing any actual damage. He then rode into the Great Hall, holding a severed head in the air by its hair, a ghost knight mounted on another ghost horse was chasing after him.


== Behind the scenes ==
Connecting the title of a highwayman and that he stole the head of another ghost, this could be the ghost of Richard "Dick" Turpin, an English man known as a burglar, horse thief and robber. If that is true the horse he is riding could be Black Bess, Turpin's black horse.
