Harold was a wizard. A portrait of him existed in the wizarding world.


== Biography ==
The portrait of Harold had once been placed at the Hogwarts Grand Staircase, but was moved to the Hog's Head Inn during the Battle of Hogwarts.
During the 2009â€“2010 school year, he met a group of students who came to Hog's Head to ask him about a map that led to a family heirloom. He told them the map was back at Hogwarts Castle in the Grand Staircase, and agreed to let the students move him back, but said the people in the bar were particular about their possessions. Lottie Turner then cast the Doubling Charm to make a copy of the portrait and the Shrinking Charm to shrink the original one in order to move it without attracting much attention. Eventually, Harold was successfully moved back to the staircase and reunited with his neighbours, namely Prentiss Pagett-Goggins and Basil Aurelius III, after the students found them and returned them to their original place.
