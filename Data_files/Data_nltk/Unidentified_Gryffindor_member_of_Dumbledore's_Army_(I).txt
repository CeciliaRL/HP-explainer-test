==== Fifth year ====
In 1995, Dolores Umbridge was appointed as Hogwarts High Inquisitor and Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, so that the Ministry of Magic could watch over Albus Dumbledore after he and Harry Potter claimed Lord Voldemort had returned. Umbridge refused to teach students any form of practical defence, and, given the circumstances, Hermione Granger felt that the student body needed a teacher who would, so then an alliance called Dumbledore's Army was formed. The Gryffindor girl's twin joined the D.A., and following in her sister's footsteps, she did so as well.
