== Biography ==
When Harry Potter arrived at The Leaky Cauldron after fleeing the Dursley house after letting his Aunt fly away in 1993, there was a wizard sitting at a table reading A Brief History of Time, a best-selling popular science book written by Hawking.
At the time of this book's publication, Hawking had been living with Lou Gehrig's disease for over twenty years, requiring him to use a wheelchair.
Coincidentally, Hawking died on the same date (14 March) as Albert Einstein was born, and at the same age (76) at which Einstein died.
