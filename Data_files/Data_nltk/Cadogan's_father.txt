This wizard was the father of Sir Cadogan, a Knight of the Round Table famous for his defeat of the Wyvern of Wye.


== Behind the scenes ==
Cadogan is a family name of Welsh and Irish origin. This could mean that Sir Cadogan's family — at least on the paternal side — hailed from Wales or Ireland. Whether Cadogan's father himself was Welsh or Irish is unconfirmed.
