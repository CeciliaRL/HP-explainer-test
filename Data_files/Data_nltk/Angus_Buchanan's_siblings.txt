These eight witches and wizards were siblings of Flora, Hamish and famed rugby player Angus Buchanan, and therefore children of John and Mary Buchanan. The daughters among this group had won the village tug-of-war every year in living memory; all of the children were described as being "enormous" and "wild".
When Angus was disowned by their father upon being rejected by the Sorting Hat as he was a Squib, he placed an edict upon them forbidding them from seeing or talking to their brother again. They, however, revolted, and attended his first rugby match, against England, which he won.


== Behind the scenes ==
In real life, Angus had eleven siblings, rather than ten, and none of them were called Hamish or Flora; their names were Mary (b. 1845), Marjory (b. 1837), Eleanor (b. 1851) , John (b. 1842), Duncan (b. 1839), Duncan Fletcher (b. 1855), Betsy (b. 1840), Margaret Eleanor (b. 1853), Ann (b. 1848), George (b. 1835) and Hugh Peter (b. 1857). Five of these siblings were born after the real-life Angus Buchanan.
