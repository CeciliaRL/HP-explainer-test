Leonardo da Vinci (15 April, 1452â€”2 May, 1519) was an Italian polymath who lived during the Renaissance era. He was a contemporary of Paracelsus and Copernicus.
One of his most famous works is his portrait of Mona Lisa, a copy of which hung at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Da Vinci died 479 years to the day before the Battle of Hogwarts.
In the real-world, Da Vinci is perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived, with interests and pursuits ranging from painting, sculpting, architecture, music, science, mathematics, engineering, invention, anatomy, geology, cartography, botany and writing. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time. 	 	 	 		 		 		 	 
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Severus Snape shows a number of images of werewolves during his lecture as a temporary Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. One of these images is a variant of the Vitruvian Man, a famous sketch by Leonardo da Vinci.
Illustrator Jim Kay loves Leonardo da Vinci. When working on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: Illustrated Edition, he wondered, "what if Leonardo da Vinchi did a study of the Mandrake, and what would it look like?", and used that as an inspiration when he approached the illustration.
