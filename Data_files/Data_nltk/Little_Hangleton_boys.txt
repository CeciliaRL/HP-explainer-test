These boys lived in Little Hangleton in the 1990s. 


== Biography ==
They liked to play tricks with the old Riddle House caretaker Frank Bryce, as they believed him to be the person behind the Riddle murders, and liked to see him limping across the Riddle House garden, brandishing his stick and yelling at them.
On the night of 20 August, 1994, Frank, upon seeing lights glimmering in the old house, thought that the kids had broken into it and started a fire. Instead it was actually Lord Voldemort and his servant Peter Pettigrew, who were planning to restore Voldemort to full power and murder Harry Potter.
