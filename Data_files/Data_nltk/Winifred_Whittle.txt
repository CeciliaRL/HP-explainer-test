Winifred Whittle was a British witch who established the Witches' Holistic Institute for Friends of Fairies (or, simply, WHIFF) of which only she and Sage Bragnam were members.


== Biography ==
She was openly critical of Muggles, denouncing them for cutting down the forest where fairies lived. She lived in a cottage in a forest inhabited by magical creatures.
Bethany Harrison, the daughter of the foreman of the Muggle construction works, was scared of her and included her in a drawing of the forest in which she was depicted as a green-skinned hag with sharp teeth. While at first, Mathilda Grimblehawk suspected it might be Whittle that was attacking the Muggle construction workers in an attempt to scare them away from the forest, after meeting her, she dismissed it, regarding her as "a harmless fairy fanatic".
