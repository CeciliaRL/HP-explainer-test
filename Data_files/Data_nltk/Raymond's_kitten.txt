The Ravenclaw student Raymond owned a kitten when he attended Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.


== History ==
She fell down one of the Castle's wells in 1991. Raymond was distraught because of this, and tried to reach her, but the well was too deep. Harry Potter found her when he was lost in the Dungeons, inside an adjoining room, which linked to the Bottom of the Well, as well as other rooms. Raymond was very pleased to have her back. Raymond later allowed Nearly Headless Nick to use her for an experiment in the Upper Castle in which students had to chase her around on unstable rocky platforms while she dropped purple Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans.
