Sulzeer Jeremiah "Sol" Campbell was a professional football player who played for the England national football team by July of 1997. By that time, he had played seventy games for the team, culminating in a win against Estonia at Wembley Stadium. When team captain John Terry showed signs of a reoccuring knee injury, manager Steve McClaren decided to have Campbell stand in for him at an upcoming game against Russia. As noted by The Guardian, this would be the first time since January of that year that Campbell made two appearances in that short of a time frame.
