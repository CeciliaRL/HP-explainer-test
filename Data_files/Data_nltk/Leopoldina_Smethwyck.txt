Leopoldina Smethwyck (1829 - 1910) was a British witch, who was well known for her career as a Quidditch referee.


== Biography ==
Smethwyck was born in 1829, somewhere in the British isles, into the wizarding Smethwyck family. She was the first witch in Great Britain to ever referee a Quidditch match. For this reason, she was featured on a silver Chocolate Frog Card, as part of the Famous Witches and Wizards Cards series. Smethwyck died in 1910.
During the 1993â€“1994 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a portrait of her guarded a secret passage to a Every Flavour Beans, Pumpkin Pasties, and Cauldron Cakes bonus room, with the password was Polyglot.


== Behind the scenes ==
The first time she refereed occurred some time before the Women's Rights Movement, although this might not matter in the wizarding world.
She may be related to Elliot Smethwyck or Hippocrates Smethwyck or both, as they share the same surname.
