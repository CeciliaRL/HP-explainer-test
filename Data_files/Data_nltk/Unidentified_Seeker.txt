During her time at Hogwarts, she was Sorted into the same house as Jacob's sibling. At some point by the 1985–1986 school year, she became the Seeker of her house's Quidditch team.
She planned to ask her mom and dad for a Comet 260 for Christmas.
She continued playing on the team the following two years.


== Behind the scenes ==
Her house is the same as that of Jacob's sibling, which is chosen by the player.
Her existence causes a contradiction for Gryffindor players, as it is established that Charles Weasley was the Seeker of the Gryffindor Quidditch team starting in the 1985–1986 school year.
She was also afraid of Gnomes.
She apparently was not skilled at Divination.
