This individual was a wizard who, during his lifetime, was Head of Gryffindor House.


== Biography ==
A portrait of this wizard hung in Gryffindor Tower. He seemed to spend most of his time sleeping, although he was willing to speak to students if they woke him up. In 1994 when Harry Potter opened his golden egg he was terrified and was seen holding his hands over his ears. In 1995, the Golden Snitch from the Quidditch Player's portrait on the opposite wall made its way into the background of his picture, much to the Seeker's annoyance. He seemed to have known James and Lily Potter when they were at Hogwarts, as he spoke of their personalities and behaviour, and remarked on their son Harry's similarities in appearance.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, he was credited as GCR Portrait Male 2, and was voiced by Tony Dudson. His portrait also appears in the Gryffindor Common Room in the video game adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, but does not speak.
This portrait seems to have been based on a 1881 portrait of Charles Darwin, by John Collier.
