This wizard with a walrus moustache was depicted in a portrait hung at Hogwarts Castle, on the chamber off the Great Hall, by the portrait of Violet. After Harry Potter was chosen by the Goblet of Fire as the fourth Triwizard Champion, Violet went into this wizard's portrait and started whispering in his ear.
