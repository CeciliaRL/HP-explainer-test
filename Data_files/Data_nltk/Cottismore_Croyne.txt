Cottismore Croyne, O.M. (unknown class), was a wizard who was appointed Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards sometime after Pierre Bonaccord. This was likely the reason he was awarded an Order of Merlin.


== Biography ==
Cottismore Croyne had a portrait of himself hung at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry by the time Albus Dumbledore, Supreme Mungwump himself in the 1990s, was Headmaster of the school. The portrait depicted him in one of the hallways in the Middle Courtyard, which suggests that he may have visited Hogwarts Castle once.


== Behind the scenes ==
This portrait was made specifically for the Harry Potter films, and was modelled after David Heyman, producer of all eight films.
This portrait was based on a portrait of Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, by Daniel Mytens the Elder (c. 1590-1647).
