This goblin was a guard at Gringotts Wizarding Bank in 1991. He wore a uniform of scarlet and gold, and stood by the bank's outer doors to greet visitors. He was described as having a pointed beard, a swarthy, clever face, and was about a head shorter than Harry Potter was when he was eleven.


== Behind the scenes ==
In the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone he appears outside Vault 713 in a photo in the Daily Prophet. He is seen talking to the Head Goblin and then walking away. The goblin was played by Binde Johal in the film.
In the film and game he doesn't have a pointed beard.
