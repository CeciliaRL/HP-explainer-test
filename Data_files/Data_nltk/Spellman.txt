Spellman was a wizard or witch who presumably wrote the first edition of Spellman's Syllabary. The edition owned by Hermione Granger was written by Rosana Amorim.


== Etymology ==
"Spellman" is English name derived of "Speller". "Speller" : 1. a person who spells words in the manner specified & 2. (Social Science / Education) a book designed to teach or improve spelling. The name has a sort of double meaning. Spell is the name of a general magical action, so it could, additionally, mean: a person who practises spells.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is possible that Spellman is just a pen name of Rosana Amorin.
It is possible that Spellman is based on Sabrina Spellman. J.K. Rowling may have added her in just like she did with other magical characters, such as Merlin.
