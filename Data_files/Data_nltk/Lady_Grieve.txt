Lady Grieve (fl. 1492) was a lady-in-waiting at the court of King Henry VII.
She met Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, a wizard, while strolling in a park on the evening of 30 October, 1492. Lady Grieve was confident that Sir Nicholas could straighten her crooked teeth, but his effort to do so backfired, causing her to grow a tusk instead. Sir Nicholas was nearly beheaded (earning him his nickname) the following morning as a result of this mishap.
