== Biography ==


=== Brigade of Witch-Hunters ===

The King wanted all the magic in the world for himself, so he created the Brigade of Witch-Hunters to gather all the wizards and witches. Sabre was among the ferocious black hounds that were given to the Brigade to help them doing this task, being the largest of them.


=== Death ===

Possibly while looking for wizards and witches with the Brigade, Sabre found a poisonous toadstool and ate it. He died shortly after, for the Captain of the Brigade's displeasure.


=== The King's "magic" ===

A Muggle Charlatan was fooling the King, pretending to be teaching him magic, while the King gave him many of his treasures. One day, the King wanted to perform his "magic" before a crowd of lords and ladies of the court. Babbitty, the King's washerwoman was a real witch, so the Charlatan placed her behind a bush, performing the magic, while the King simply waved his twig. When the Captain of the Brigade of Witch-Hunters arrived, he showed Sabre's lifeless body to the King, begging him to bring him back to life. The foolish King brandished his twig and pointed it at the dead dog. But inside the bush, Babbitty did nothing, because she knew that no magic can raise the dead.
