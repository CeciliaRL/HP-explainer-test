In November or December 1926, these five Aurors were sent to a Derelict château somewhere in Europe that Gellert Grindelwald used as a hideout during his attacks. While there it was night-time and it was very foggy. After entering the grounds, they edged slowly towards the Château with their wands out, illuminated with the Wand-Lighting Charm. They were then hit with an unidentified dark charm that blew them back and killed them.
