Yardley Platt (1446 - 1557) was an infamous wizard who was known for being a serial goblin killer. He was featured on a Chocolate Frog Card.


== Behind the scenes ==
On the Chocolate Frog Cards featured in the video games, Platt is portrayed as a blond wizard. At the Wizard of the Month section at J. K. Rowling's official site, however, he is featured as a black-haired wizard.
The Chocolate Frog Card portrait of Platt appears to be a direct homage to a famous promotional photo of Frank Gorshin as the Batman villain Edward Nygma ("the Riddler").
