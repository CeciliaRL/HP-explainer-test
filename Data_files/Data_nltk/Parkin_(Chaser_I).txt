Parkin (fl. 1422) was a Scottish witch or wizard who played as a Chaser for the original Wigtown Wanderers team during the 15th century and was a child of Wanderers founder Walter Parkin. 
The Wanderers were a formidable team during this time who won most of their matches, perhaps partly because Walter himself used to attend every game holding his wand in one hand and a meat cleaver in the other. The original Chasers invented their own signature move, known as the Parkin's Pincer, where three Chasers fly from different directions at an opposing Chaser.
