Henry VII (28 January 1457 â€“ 21 April 1509) was King of England from his seizure of the crown in 1485 until his death.
He was the father of King Henry VIII and the grandfather of Queens Mary I and Elizabeth I.
Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington was a wizard at King Henry's royal court.


== Etymology ==
The name "Henry" comes from the Germanic name Heimirich which meant "home ruler", composed of the elements heim "home" and ric "power, ruler". It was later commonly spelled Heinrich, with the spelling altered due to the influence of other Germanic names like Haganrich, in which the first element is hagan "enclosure".


== Behind the scenes ==
The portrait of Poderick Cruickshank seems to have been based on a 1505 portrait of Henry VII by an unknown artist.
