Lisa del Giocondo, better known as Mona Lisa (archaic Italian for Lady Lisa), was a witch whose portrait was well-known in both Non-magic world and Wizarding world.

She was depicted in an oil painting by the Florentine artist Leonardo da Vinci completed circa 1503–1519. A copy of her portrait was hung in the Hospital Wing at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
