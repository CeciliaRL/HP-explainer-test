This wizard participated in the Battle of Hogwarts. After the Death Eaters managed to break the protective enchantments protecting Hogwarts Castle, he was aiming spells at the oncoming forces at the Viaduct over at the the battlements around The Quad. A Death Eater blew up part of the battlements, and Apparated into the catwalks within. There, he ruthlessly killed this wizard, who was caught off-guard, with a Killing Curse before starting a duel with Arthur Weasley.


== Behind the scenes ==
It is unclear who this wizard was, as he only appeared for a split second in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. As he was by Order members Arthur Weasley, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Remus Lupin, there is the possibility he was a part of the Order of the Phoenix, but it is more likely he was a member of the Hogwarts staff.
