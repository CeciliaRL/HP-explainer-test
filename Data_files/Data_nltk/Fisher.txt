Sergeant Fisher (fl. 1977) was a British policeman who was partnered with Police Constable Anderson.


== Biography ==
A large man, Fisher at some point in his life joined the police force and had a daughter who dated a guitarist. In 1977, he was partnered with PC Anderson, and followed a motorbike that was speeding through the streets of an unnamed city and finally cornered it in a dead-end alley. As the two attempted to arrest the pair of youths on the bike — who identified themselves as Sirius Black and James Potter — they witnessed an attack on the pair by three men flying on broomsticks.
