Madam Edgecombe was a British witch and the wife of Mr Edgecombe and the mother of Marietta.
She worked in the British Ministry of Magic as a Floo Network Regulator and assisted Dolores Umbridge in monitoring the incoming and outgoing communications of the Hogwarts Castle fireplaces in 1995. She was a supporter of the then-Minister Cornelius Fudge's claim that Lord Voldemort was dead. Due to her career, she forbade her daughter from doing anything that may get on Umbridge's bad side.
