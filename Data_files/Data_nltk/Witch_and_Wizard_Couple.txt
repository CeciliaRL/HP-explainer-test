This Wizard and Witch Couple was a portrait of a wizard and a witch, who, given their clothing style, were assumed to have lived at some time during the Tudor Period.
The portrait, painted by Roderick Plumpton, hung at Hogwarts Castle in the 1990s, close to the ground-floor landing of the Grand Staircase.
