Annis Black (fl. 1999) was a British Hag who lived in a cave in Deadmarsh, England during the late twentieth century. She wrote a letter to the Daily Prophet complaining about the paper's portrayal of Hags as flesh-eating monsters. Her letter stated that her own interests included poetry, crochet and gardening. She also offered baby-sitting services.


== Behind the scenes ==
The name Annis Black is presumably based on the legendary Hag Black Annis, who is said to have eaten human children, and then hung their skins on the walls of her cave. Therefore, it seems somewhat suspicious that she would want to offer baby-sitting services to look after human children, possibly implying that like the rest of her species, she has a taste for their flesh.
Annis Black was not related to the pure-blood wizarding House of Black.
