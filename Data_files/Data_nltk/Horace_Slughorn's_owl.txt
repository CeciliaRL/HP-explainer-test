This owl belonged to Professor Horace Slughorn. He used it to send his messages to the Slug Club in both tenures as Potions Master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Barnabas Cuffe would always be happy to take the owl to hear Horace's point of view on the day's news in the Daily Prophet.
