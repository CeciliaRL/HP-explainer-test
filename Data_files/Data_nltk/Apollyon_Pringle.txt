Apollyon Pringle was the caretaker at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1960s. He was the caretaker of Hogwarts while Arthur and Molly Weasley were attending, which Molly related to Harry Potter and Bill Weasley in 1995 before the third task of the Triwizard Tournament.
Apparently Hogwarts allowed him to use corporal punishment on students, as Mrs Weasley told Harry that he caned Arthur for being out late, with her even saying that he still had the marks.
