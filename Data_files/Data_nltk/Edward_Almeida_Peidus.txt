Edward Almeida Peidus was a wizard whose name was carved into a wood panel on the wall of Professor Trelawney's Divination Classroom.


== Etymology ==
The name "Edward" means "rich guard", derived from the Old English elements ead "rich, blessed" and weard "guard". Saint Edward the Confessor was the king of England shortly before the Norman conquest. He was known as a just ruler, and because of his popularity this name remained in use after the conquest when most other Old English names were replaced by Norman ones.
