Samuel Equiano was a Nigerian wizard who played as the Seeker for the 2014 Nigerian National Quidditch team. During the second match of the 427th Quidditch World Cup, against Fiji, Samuel Equiano was quite some distance away from the Snitch when the opposing Seeker, Joseph Snuka, decided to catch it while his team was losing 400 to 10, much to the bewilderment of the commentators, the fury of the Fijian supporters and the jeers of the Nigerians.
