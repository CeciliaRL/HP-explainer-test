Ricbert (d. 1 May, 1998) was a Goblin who worked in the capacity of Chief Bank Teller at Gringotts Wizarding Bank during the late 1990s.


== History ==
Following Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger's break-in of the Bank in 1998, Ricbert was in the main lobby as the security dragon violently erupted through it. Despite being only a few feet from where the dragon erupted into the lobby, Ricbert managed to escape the bank, but was soon summoned, with other goblins and guards, to Malfoy Manor, where he was killed by Lord Voldemort in an angry rage.

== Behind the scenes ==
This goblin is not named in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, however, the original screenplay had Bogrod referring to him as "Ricbert".
Rusty Goffe portrays Ricbert in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
In the second part of the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, this goblin is the one who Hermione Granger (disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange) and Ronald Weasley (disguised as "Dragomir Despard") address. He later calls for Bogrod. In the novel, video game and LEGO game, however, they approach Bogrod from the beginning.
