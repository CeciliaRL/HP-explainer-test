Janus Thickey, a British wizard, was married to a woman and had some children. When, in 1973, their father faked his own death by pretending that a Lethifold had eaten him, she and her children entered a period of mourning. However, their mourning was cut short when Janus was found to be living five miles away, with the landlady of the Green Dragon.
