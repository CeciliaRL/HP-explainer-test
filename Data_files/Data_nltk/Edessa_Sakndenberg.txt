Professor Edessa Sakndenberg (or possibly Skanderberg)  (fl. 1503) was a Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the early sixteenth century.


== Biography ==


=== Lifetime ===
Professor Sakndenberg lived in the fifteenth century. In her lifetime, she was a social historian, specialising in Muggle society. She was appointed Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and had a portrait painted in 1503.


=== Post-mortem ===
After her death, her portrait was hung in the Headmaster's office, so that she could advise the current Headmaster. She had more portraits around the castle: in the East Wing, Grand Staircase and other halls such as the Glanmore Peakes' Corridor


== Etymology ==
"Edessa" (probably originally from a Phrygian or Illyrian word meaning "tower in the water") is the name of a Greek city and, in Ancient Greece, also a province.
Her surname may be the Albanian name Skanderbeg influenced by German names ending in -en-berg.


== Behind the scenes ==
Edessa Sakndenberg's portrait was based on a 1706 portrait of the Henwife of Castle Grant by Richard Waitt.
The phrase on Sakndenberg's portrait (mirabile visu) is a Latin expression, meaning "wonderful to behold."
On a wood panel in the Divination Classroom of Hogwarts, a name is partially visible, with '...essa Skanderberg' readable, possibly yet another alternative spelling of her name.
On the cover of the Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles prop that was featured on the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, Edessa Skanderberg is credited to have authored the book. This is canonically wrong, as we know the book was written by Wilhelm Wigworthy in 1987, but nevertheless we can conclude from the text of the back cover blurb that Edessa was a "social historian and Muggle specialist".
Her portrait in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery is titled "Edessa Skandenberg", but as third-tier canon is outranked by the spelling on the second-tier film portrait.
