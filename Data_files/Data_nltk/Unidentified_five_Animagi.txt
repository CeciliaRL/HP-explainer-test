These five people were wizards or witches (or both) who were known to be registered Animagi; however their animal forms are unknown. Hermione Granger referred to them by saying that there were only seven registered Animagi in the 20th century. Since the Marauders trio (Prongs, Padfoot and Wormtail) were unregistered, it is at least conceivable that others may have effected this transformation without registering.


== Behind the scenes ==
An unidentified Animagus appears in LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4. She took the form of a black cat. As she changed shape in a public location, it is likely she was registered.
It is possible that Jacob's sibling is one of them, as in the Animagus achievement quest in Harry Potter: Hogwarts Mystery, the player gets to choose whether or not they want to register.
