Mopsus was a blind Seer whose power was great enough for him to accurately predict future events.


== Behind the scenes ==
J. K. Rowling stated at a press conference in 2005 that Mopsus was "a very, very early character", conceived of while she was still in the process of planning out Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. She said she chose to cut him because his skill at Divination was "too good", and that having such a talented Seer around during Harry Potter's time would be detrimental to the story's drama, because it meant there would be someone who knew how things were going to turn out. However, it seems Mopsus may not have been discarded until after the second book, as he is given as the Professor of Divination on a list of Hogwarts teachers which Rowling created at the time she was working on Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.
