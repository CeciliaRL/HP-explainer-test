This wizard was a Snatcher who served under Fenrir Greyback during the Second Wizarding War.


== Biography ==
He was part of the group that captured Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger and took them to Malfoy Manor. Bellatrix Lestrange was shocked when she saw him holding the sword of Gryffindor, and demanded to know where he had gotten it (believing it to have been in her vault at Gringotts). He most unwisely refused her demand to hand it over and was stunned by the enraged witch.


== Behind the scenes ==
This Snatcher was portrayed by Samuel Roukin in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1.
In the film, the Snatcher tells Bellatrix that the sword was in Hermione's bag when they searched her and reckons that it belongs to him now. In response, Bellatrix hits him with a spell which blasts him backwards onto the stairs, killing him. He is also shown to have the Snitch in his possession, but it flutters out of his pocket and returns to Harry when he passes his corpse on the stairs.
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, the Snatcher is omitted. Instead, Bellatrix Lestrange finds the Sword of Gryffindor in Hermione's handbag.
