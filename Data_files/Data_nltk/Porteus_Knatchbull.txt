Minister Porteus Knatchbull was Minister for Magic from 1781 to 1789.


== Biography ==
He was called in confidentially in 1782 by the Muggle Prime Minister of the day, Lord North, to see whether he could help with King George III's emerging mental instability. Word leaked out that Lord North believed in wizards, and he was forced to resign after a motion of no confidence.
First elected in 1781, he was reelected at least once, and possibly was defeated for reelection in 1789.
