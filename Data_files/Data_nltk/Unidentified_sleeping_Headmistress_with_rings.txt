This witch was appointed Headmistress of Hogwarts likely sometime before Professor Dippet. After her death, her portrait was hung in the Headmaster's office, in order to give advice to the current head. Her portrait is commonly found between the Pink-faced Hogwarts Headmaster and Fytherley Undercliffe and depicts her reclining on an upholstered chair under a crescent moon.
