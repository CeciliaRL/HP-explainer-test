This portrait depicted a mad old man, and it was hung at Hogwarts Castle, in the Lower Chambers Portrait Corridor, next to a portrait of a sleeping hermit.


== Behind the scenes ==
This portrait is depicted wearing an upside-down funnel as a hat. The inverted funnel has, since the Middle Ages, been used to represent the mad. It has, therefore, appeared in several artistic depictions of mad men through the centuries such as Hieronymus Bosch's The Ship of Fools and Allegory of Gluttony and Lust, and, more recently and perhaps more notably, is present in many depictions of the Tin Woodman of L. Frank Baum's classic novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, although that is never specifically mentioned in the story - it stemmed from W.W. Denslow's original illustrations for the book.
