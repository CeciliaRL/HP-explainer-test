This young witch maid worked for Tom, the then-landlord of the Leaky Cauldron. In 1993, she knocked on the door of a room and announced herself as housekeeping. The room's resident responded with a bellowing roar and slammed the door in her face. Completely unperturbed, she remarked that she would come back later and walked away. She pulled a wagon with cleaning supplies and had a magical broom that swept by itself.
