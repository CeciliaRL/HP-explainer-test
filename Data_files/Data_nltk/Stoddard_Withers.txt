Lord Stoddard Withers (1642 â€“ 1769) was a wizard and Magizoologist who bred Winged horses. He created a sport that combined elements of polo and Quidditch, which was played on Winged horses instead of broomsticks. The sport never became popular though.


== Etymology ==
The English word "withers" refers to the back of a horse, specifically between the shoulder-blades (at which place winged horses' wings can be expected to be found).
