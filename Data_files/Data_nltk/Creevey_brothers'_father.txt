Mr Creevey was the father of Colin and Dennis Creevey. A Muggle, Mr Creevey was employed as a milkman, and was astonished to learn that his elder son, Colin, was a wizard. Colin sent plenty of photographs home to his father during his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1992, a high proportion, presumably, of Harry Potter, who was an object of near-worship for young Colin.
