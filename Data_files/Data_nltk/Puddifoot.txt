Madam Puddifoot (fl. 1980s-1996) was a British witch who ran Madam Puddifoot's Tea Shop in Hogsmeade.


== Biography ==
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			Madam Puddifoot working in her shop 		 	 
In the 1980s, Puddifoot was introduced to Jacob's sibling by Bill Weasley and Nymphadora Tonks.
In 1996, Valentine's day, Puddifoot decorated her shop by placing several golden cherubs around and had them throw confetti over visiting couples every so often. She served coffee to the couple Harry Potter and Cho Chang.
By at least the 2010s, during the Calamity, volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force met with Madam Puddifoot to try to convince her to join the SOS Task Force officially. She enthusiastically agreed and informed all staff to do whatever necessary to help support the Ministry's efforts.


== Physical appearance ==
Puddifoot was a very stout woman with brown eyes and a shiny black bun.


== Behind the scenes ==
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, Madam Puddifoot is depicted with blonde hair rather than black. She is not playable under normal circumstances, but may be temporarily controlled with the Imperius Curse in the level "Dumbledore's Army" in order to collect the Slytherin House Crest for that level.
It is possible she, alongside her fellow Hogsmeade residents, participated in the Battle of Hogwarts, as Horace Slughorn was recruiting them and Lord Voldemort declared a final stand for the entire Second Wizarding War.
