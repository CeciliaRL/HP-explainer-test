This Muggle Station Guard was employed at King's Cross Station, London, during at least the 1990s, through the 2010s.


== Biography ==


=== 1991 ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			The station guard in 1991 		 	 
Harry Potter first met the station guard on 1 September 1991, while trying to find his way to Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. Not knowing how to access the platform, he did not dare to mention the Platform to the guard, but he told him he was trying to reach Hogwarts; this was unsuccessful, as the Muggle guard had of course never heard of the school, and when Harry simply asked him what train was leaving at eleven o'clock, he told him there wasn't one, and then stopped talking to Harry, muttering under his breath that he was a "time waster". Thankfully for Harry, he quickly met the wizarding Weasley family who showed him how to access the platform.


=== 1992 ===
 	 	 	 		 		 		 			This station guard talking to a commuter 		 	 

On 1 September 1992, Harry and Ron Weasley tried entering Platform 9Â¾, but were prevented from doing so, as the entrance had been magically blocked by the House-elf Dobby. The station guard saw the two boys running into the wall and angrily asked them what they were doing. Harry got up, telling him that the two lost control of their trolleys.


=== 2017 ===
In 2017, this individual was still employed at King's Cross.


== Behind the scenes ==
The station guard was portrayed by Harry Taylor in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.
In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, it isn't exactly specified if the station guard who is alarmed by Harry and Ron crashing into the barrier is the same guard who talks to Harry in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, but as the same actor (Harry Taylor) plays this character in their film adaptations, this canonically makes this guard present in both novels.
He originally appeared in the Epilogue scene at King's Cross station in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, but he was cut from the second shoot of the scene.
The guard is also a playable character in the consoles versions of the LEGO video games.
In LEGO Harry Potter: Years 5-7, despite being a Muggle, he appears in Platform Nine and Three-Quarters and in the Hogsmeade station.
